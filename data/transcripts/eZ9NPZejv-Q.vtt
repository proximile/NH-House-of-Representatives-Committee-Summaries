I it's not going to go on cons well is
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
calendar

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
confused okay let's let's back up
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative power go ahead thank you
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um it appears to me as
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
though um there's some confusion as to
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
what we're voting on and what Bill we're
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
on so I would respectfully request that
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
maybe we slow down the pace a little bit
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
so that people can get organized and and
 
00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
understand where we are I I'm having a
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
little bit of trouble myself thank you
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
1258 or are we on
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
1086 1258 right8 1258
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
so there seem to
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
be the possibility of a confusion on
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
the all right let's just take two two
 
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:43.070 align:start position:0%
the all right let's just take two two
minutes

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
here okay so there appears to have been
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
some confusion on that vote
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
so I believe there's nothing that
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
prevents us from going back and taking a
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
revote on that motion to reconsider
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider second
 
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.039 align:start position:0%
representative sis second all
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
unanimously and now we will reconsider
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
and revote when
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.830 align:start position:0%
so I believe that the zpas would have to
uh

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps amend their rules of procedure
 
00:25:57.399 --> 00:25:58.590 align:start position:0%
perhaps amend their rules of procedure
to

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
to include this type of uh time period
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
for notice and posting to the
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
website so they'd have to have a meeting
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
I think the public could weigh in I
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
think that the that the
 
00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:15.559 align:start position:0%
citizens should be
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
deciding um if they want notice this
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
way so I put in the
 
00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:26.590 align:start position:0%
way so I put in the
language

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
that the notice should be posted no
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
later than three business days from the
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
date the hearing for the appeal is
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
RSA 676 col 7 public hearing
 
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
notice uh Roman 2 says the public
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
hearing shall be held within 45 days of
 
00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
the receipt of the notice of appeal so
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
the zba has 45 days to to set a hearing
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
date now if they adopt
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
this posting to the website in lie of
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
correct if hypothetically they met on
 
00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.950 align:start position:0%
correct if hypothetically they met on
day

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
45 and fix the date of a hearing and
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
let's say that day was a Friday and then
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
there was a long
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
weekend so they would have three
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
business days after the long weekend to
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
post notice to the website that would
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
give non
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
abutters and a Butters a whopping 39
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
days of
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
notice of an application and a hearing
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
five days is not enough time
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
to possibly retain you know counsel get
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
the records review the pl plan and I
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
have seen non abutters and abutters show
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
up at these hearings they're completely
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
bewildered they're unprepared they don't
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
have counsel if you think of a gravel
 
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.830 align:start position:0%
have counsel if you think of a gravel
pit

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
application those are uh Often by zoning
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
Allowed by right if it's in an
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
industrial zoned
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
area if not they have to file for
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
special exception which is with the zba
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go to the planning
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
board first they can go directly to the
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
zba so the more
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
notice that's out there and I think um
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
the town website would generate Word of
 
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.230 align:start position:0%
the town website would generate Word of
Mouth

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
Mouth
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
advertising and the fact that a
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
newspaper you only have one listing on
 
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
one day you have to subscribe we we got
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
a uh message from the conquered monitor
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
I did by email and they were complaining
 
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.909 align:start position:0%
I did by email and they were complaining
that

00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
um that the newspaper is the only way to
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
go and I disagree I think that um
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
sharing information that you see on the
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
town website is going to be more
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
impactful to getting word out to the
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
town's people so I'm very much in favor
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
of this and I I hope you'll uh vote to
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
pass this amendment thank you thank you
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
is is it appropriate for committee
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
members to ask questions with regards to
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment for clarification
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely if the U presenter is willing
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
to accept questions sure absolutely
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um representative so
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
is am I correct in understanding that
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment that you're offering here
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
today changes one aspect of um of the
 
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
original Bill and that is your Amendment
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
on lines 5 through six compare that to
 
00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:32.990 align:start position:0%
on lines 5 through six compare that to
lines

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
15 line 15 on the the bill text so
 
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
you're CH what you're doing is that
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you're changing it
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
from this notice must be posted on the
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
website no no less than five days before
 
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.470 align:start position:0%
website no no less than five days before
the

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
date for the appeal the hearing date for
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
the appeal no less than five days so
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
that gives us like five days but you're
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
changing your Amendment changes that
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
requirement to no less than three
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
business days from the date that the
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
date of that hearing for the appeal was
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Jo Kell
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh um if you could respond to this this
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
hypothetical um it seems like there is a
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
question of when the
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
hearing for the appeal is fixed um the
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
requests for the uh the
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
application may be received by the
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
municipality and
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
and um they may not they may have a
 
00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:05.799 align:start position:0%
regular regular scheduled meeting and
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's um the the person may assign the
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
the local official May assign that uh
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
hearing to the the uh next meeting but
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
when that occurs when they schedule it
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
for that next meeting um is not
 
00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
necessarily transparent to the public is
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
it when they look at their email when
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
they look at their calendar when they um
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
receive the the actual
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
application um and
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
so for judging about whether or not the
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh the notice the the meeting was
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
properly noticed you would have to
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
determine when the actual date of the
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
hearing is fixed and if there wasn't a
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
vote by the board to fix the meeting
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
date then you wouldn't know particularly
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
when that date was fixed so you wouldn't
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
know where 3 days started if you see
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
what I'm getting at do
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
you if if the staff for the
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
um the zoning
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
themselves how does the public know that
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
I believe the CBA has to meet to accept
 
00:33:35.919 --> 00:33:37.549 align:start position:0%
I believe the CBA has to meet to accept
an

00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
application and the clock starts on the
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
date so they would have to fix the date
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
of a hearing within the 45
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
days and would post notice
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair um

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
mathematics behind um the change that
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%

00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
and there was a long
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
weekend they would have three business
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
days from that date to post the
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
notice and that would happen at any time
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
during the 45 days if they met on day
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
30 and they fixed the date of the
 
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.190 align:start position:0%
30 and they fixed the date of the
hearing

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.349 align:start position:0%
hearing
for

00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
whenever they would have three business
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
days after that to post the notice to
 
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.990 align:start position:0%
days after that to post the notice to
the

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
website representative
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
hollan um so I think the intent of the
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
bill itself was they were saying that
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of communities that no
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
longer have a local newspaper and
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
therefore we were trying to cast we're
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
not we're trying to cast the widest net
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
to let people know that there's a really
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
important hearing here and we want them
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
to to know it's occurring and that's why
 
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
we said that they had the town website
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
for example in Durham we do have Fosters
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
Daily Democrat that that is based in
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
Dober but it most people in Durham are
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
not a lot of people in Durham are not
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
reading it so we're doing it locally
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
through a a Friday updates that the town
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
is putting out every week so I just I'm
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
confused so again the five-day not we
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
giving really good notice is the intent
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill I hope and so that is
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
5 days why would you want to cut it to
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
three it's like you're un it kind of
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
undermines the the what you're trying to
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish I guess is my my
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
thought thank you I I'll just say a
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
couple things I don't believe it's
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
cutting to three it's actually
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
increasing it substantially
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
because you're doing it has to be set
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
three days from the time the meeting is
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
set so that if I'm understanding the
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
amendment correctly it could actually
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
increase it to 15 20 30 40 days rather
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
than five it's it extends the way it's
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
written the way I read the amendment
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's what it would do uh
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh Power one thank you Mr
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
chairman I I to um I guess reiterate the
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
point that um representative yella was
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
was making is that there's confusion
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
with regards to this amendment and the
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
the way that it's worded is um
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
out there's a concern with regards
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
to what defines when the meeting is
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
fixed at the next time the board meets
 
00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
possible that the meeting could be fixed
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
somehow prior to to
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
that I believe the answer
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
is okay I'm I guess I'm not sure what
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
the answer is I'm not on one one of
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
these land use boards so maybe somebody
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
who has experience with how the those
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
boards work could comment thank you
 
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.470 align:start position:0%
boards work could comment thank you
representative

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um I was just looking at the
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
original un amended Bill and it has the
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
exact same language of before the date
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
fixed for the hearing of the appeal
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
except with five days instead the only
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
difference I'm seeing is um in the
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
number there the amendment has three the
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
original bill has five so I think that
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear in all cases a
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
reduction representative
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
yella thank you uh Mr chair so I am on a
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
zba and that was actually my first first
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
board that I I
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
joined um
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
the in the case of my municipality we
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
have a standing meeting of the zba every
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
fourth Tuesday of the month and if we
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
receive uh application the the person
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
that receives it just assigns it to the
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
next meeting date um so I think the
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
intent of this is to say three days from
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
the receipt of the application and not
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
three dates three days from the date
 
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
that the appeal is fixed because if that
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
person you know was out of the office
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
for you know a a doctor's appointment or
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
something if they received that
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
application just because she didn't
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
assign it to that that uh she didn't see
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
and fix the date um until she got back
 
00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
from the doctor's office it's still
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
received on the day in question and the
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
the three days should start from the
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
date received I believe uh I think that
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
was is the lack of clarity inside of
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
this um uh this uh Amendment so thank
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
you U representative Gilman thank you Mr
 
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
chair um I have also sat on my town zba
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
and the way I read this is that the zba
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
meets let's say the first of the month
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
um an appeal is made to them or is going
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
to be made to them um and the zba fixes
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
the date not the STA and the zba fixes a
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
date for the 30th of the month and this
 
00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
is saying um no uh it needs to be posted
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
no later than three days for the date
 
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
fixed later in the month that
 
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
correct is that
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
Elward yes I have a um note from
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
Rulo he says getting back to your
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
amendment I think keying in on the date
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
of submission of the
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
application rather than the date of the
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
hearing as the anchor for setting the
 
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.829 align:start position:0%
hearing as the anchor for setting the
time

00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
requirements is good out of the box
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
thinking thank you representative
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you Mr chair
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm just I was just going around the
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
room I think uh just looking at the the
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
Dems I'm not I think this is probably
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
still consistent with the with
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
Republicans every one of us has land use
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
experience I think that we are all I
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
think there's probably favorable toward
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill and every one of us
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
is confused about this amendment but I'm
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
not hearing confusing about the
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
underlying bill I think the three days
 
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
cuts it short I think the three days I
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
think the five days is when you um when
 
00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
you have the appeal not for when
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
scheduling but regardless this gets us
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
confused the bill I think we can all
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
agree is good
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
but this amendment is confusing there's
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
no way I can support it thank you sorry
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for actually
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
speaking to the amendment representative
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
that was on point um I think what we
 
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
will do unless anybody wants to continue
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
speaking I think I would like to
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
representative power go ahead thank you
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would concur with the
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative statements I am confused
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
by this
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to put forward and
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
propagate confusion in statute and um
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
while this amendment is well-intentioned
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
it it the language is just it's not
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
there so I will I cannot support this
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
amendment as written okay so what I'm
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
going to suggest is that we take a vote
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
on the amendment um and depending on the
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
disposition of the underlying bill um if
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
that were to pass here it would go to

the other body uh once it goes to to the
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
other body maybe
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
1086 is there uh representative PRI
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
seconds would you like to speak to your
 
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman so um
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
we I received as well as probably the
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
committee if you checked your email um
 
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
input with regards to this this
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
particular Bill and while I understand
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
um I guess the intent of the bill there
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
are some concerns with the bill as
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
written and the concerns are
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
um this bill would um eliminate
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
the use of publication in a printed
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
newspaper and so there's a lot of
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
concerns with that with re if if the
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
notices were simply published on a
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
website there are a lot of people that
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
do not have internet access nor are they
 
00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:19.910 align:start position:0%
do not have internet access nor are they
digitally

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
digitally
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
literate another concern that was um
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
highlighted was that newspapers are
 
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
neutral whereas publication on a
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
government website may or may or may not
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
be um neutral again there's also the
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
accessibility with being able to um
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
access such a notice uh
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
electronically there's also um concerns
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
with ar archiving and verification of
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
the legitimacy of such a public
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
application with a printed newspaper
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
that is not so much of a con
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
concern and um another point that was
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
brought out um was that the the
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
inadequacy of a digital only notice um
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
has some serious considerations with
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
regards to the um permanent archival
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
record of such a notice that may be
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
needed for historical purposes as well
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
as for legal purposes so for those
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
reasons um I will be voting it on this
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill as as
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
written representative PRI thank you Mr
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I agree with all the comments
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
that uh the previous representative has
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh stated and I also believe in this
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill will be taking away one of the most
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights in our community and
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's freedom of the press and
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
I I anything we can do to strengthen
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
them and to strengthen their access I am
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
for that thank
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
Elwood I just want to make note that
 
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:20.200 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in um
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
33-3 uh- a colon 3 the disposition and
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
retention SC schedule there's nothing in
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
um having to
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
notices any further comments
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
representative gallaga um so I um I I'm
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit more supportive of the
 
00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
basic under in concept of the bill than
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
the previous speakers um I think it is a
 
00:49:05.789 --> 00:49:05.799 align:start position:0%
good idea to have something like this um
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
I do have some uh cons concerns about
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
the wording of this particular
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
implementation though it sounded like
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
the intent when um the bill was being
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
presented was to make it for places that
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
no longer have their um own newspaper
 
00:49:26.589 --> 00:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
but looking at the existing wording it
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
says in lie of publication of notice in
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
a newspaper of General circulation um
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
that to me sounds like it apply even in
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
places where there is still a
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
newspaper um so I I think um I I think I
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
would want to see a version of um this
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
bill applying just to specifically to
 
00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:49.799 align:start position:0%
the places where there isn't a newspaper
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
anymore and I'd support that version but
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
not this one representative yella no
 
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair um I support the
 
00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
underlying motion or the underlying bill
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
and I uh don't have any issues with
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
um online uh
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
notices um we do it at the state house
 
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
00:50:23.789 --> 00:50:23.799 align:start position:0%
no uh problem with that and I don't
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
think that we should m make uh uh
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
decisions based on kind of the the
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
collapsing industry of newspapers um and
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
trying to prop them up by giving them
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh by Statute um I don't
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
subscribe to a newspaper and probably
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
most of my generation does not so um
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's much easier for me to find this
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
information on a
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
website um than on a possible website
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
that is um gated um so I will be
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
supporting the the motion of uh a to
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
pass thank you represent
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
Frack uh thank you Mr chair I would
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
remind representative yella that the
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
majority of U New Hampshire's population
 
00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.910 align:start position:0%
majority of U New Hampshire's population
is

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
aging and we do not
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the computer skills to
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
find everything that's going on um I
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
think we need to look at
 
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
the overall public
 
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.710 align:start position:0%
the overall public
good

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
and from my conversations with um one or
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
two newspaper
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
Publishers if this bill were taken to
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
its logical extent which would be all
 
00:51:54.839 --> 00:51:55.910 align:start position:0%
its logical extent which would be all
public

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
notices would be required or would not
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
be required to be published in a
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
newspaper it would have significant
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
effects on the newspaper's ability to
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
provide locally oriented locally focused
 
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
news which is what keeps our local
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
governments honest thank you
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative K Hill thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
I would echo my my colleagues uh
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%

00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
difference in propping up uh newspapers
 
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
for profits than propping up IP
 
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
providers and uh web hosting that those
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
Services cost money as well uh there's
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
really no difference um if we want to
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
drag in propping them up and I will
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%

um if posting to a website where there
 
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:43.720 align:start position:0%
um and and the newspaper is only for one
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
day I think that it's beneficial to the
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
website okay um
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
I think where we're at on this bill
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
unless there's a an extreme need to say
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
any more and I think we're going to have
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
quite a divided uh gotcha divided vote
 
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
on this one so um if if we want to
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
continue discussing we can do that uh
 
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
chairman I would like to point out that
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities right now can can post
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
these notes notices to websites without
 
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.030 align:start position:0%
these notes notices to websites without
this

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
bill and furthermore I would hope that
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
for those municipalities that do have
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
websites that they would do so so that
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
such notices are posted electronically
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
as well as in print
 
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.750 align:start position:0%
as well as in print
therefore

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
catching all demographics in the granite
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
Frack yes I would like to um comment on
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative kahill's suggestion that
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
we do not subsidize profit making
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
businesses and as an example I would
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
cite a I believe $7
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
million uh the member will suspend uh
 
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
try to keep
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
comments on the actual bill okay I'm
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chair
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
thanks reprentative
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
majority thank you Mr chair I I guess
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
I'm all in on this one with a pair of
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
twos but uh I said before that it
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
sounded like we were going to support
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
this I'm still going to support this I I
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
I spoke with my town uh Planning and
 
00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:41.039 align:start position:0%
Zoning administrator who thought it was
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
a very good idea and uh when he
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
circulated it uh he got some positive
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
support on it so I guess I'm still going
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
to support but I think I'm going to lose
 
00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:50.990 align:start position:0%
to support but I think I'm going to lose
my

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
hand par of twos isn't very high there
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
input during the bill
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
hearing it was um noted that the word
 
01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in my amended language
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
was in
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
precise and I worked with New Hampshire
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association I um proposed
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
three variations to clarify that word
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and we settled on the
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
terms on the words warrant articles with
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
a tax impact I appreciate that input and
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
that um more clearly and specifically
 
01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.630 align:start position:0%
that um more clearly and specifically
um

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
achieves what I wanted to um with this
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
you are there any comments on represent
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
Holland uh thank you Mr sherett so I I
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
think uh the underlying Bill what we
 
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
were concerned with was when you said
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
Appropriations was it gross
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation or was it actually the net
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation which I guess in her
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
flowchart was really great and so uh I
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
think the and I think this is probably
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
the most Wordsmith statement that we've
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
ever done as a non- tax cap Community
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about our budget goal
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
this is always our focus and I think the
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
amendment really helps to fix it and
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
clarify it and I think moving into any
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
budget uh cycle where you begin to talk
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
about what either your tax cap or your
 
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
budget goal and having Clarity in that
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
is really important as you move through
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
the difficult decisions so I I think the
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is a good one thank you
 
01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.430 align:start position:0%
amendment is a good one thank you

1461 while the clerk gets ready for
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
1544 uh 1708 is next was next on the
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
agenda however uh yesterday afternoon I
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
received a call from the house Judiciary
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
Committee asking if we might not exec
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
this so they could attach potentially
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
the that bill over to some other
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that they're dealing with
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
that is very very similar so I acceded
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
to that request so we're not going to
 
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
act on it today uh we'll hold it in OB
 
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
bance in case something goes astray over
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
there but um for now we are just going
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.110 align:start position:0%
 
action

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right representative saus Mr chair
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
this is a question for you it's a
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
procedural question um since you have
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
spoken you just you have spoken with the
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
other committee on this bill and it is
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
still our bill um what input advice will
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
we be seeking from the members of this
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee as that bill goes forward or
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
is there some other process that will
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
take place that we will have an
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment on whereby this
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
committee gives over this bill vacates
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
this bill corre the other committee
 
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
corre again we will hold this in
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
abayance so
 
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
if the contents of the original bill is
 
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.110 align:start position:0%
if the contents of the original bill is
not

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
um done over in judiciary we will still
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
have authority over the bill whether or
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
not we decide to go forward with it or
 
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.270 align:start position:0%
not we decide to go forward with it or
not

01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess that they will have to hold a
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on non
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
gerain um on a non- gerain bill in
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
judiciary so I would say if there's
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
comments from anybody on the committee
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
who wants to speak to that when they not
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
notice that uh
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
nonchain bill that maybe show up in
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
judiciary to make the comments heard um
 
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
again I I received prior
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
PR to us holding the hearing we C we
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
can't at this point um vacate the bill
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
over there we can't do that because
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
we've already held the hearing held a
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on this so the only way of this
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
being allowed over there is through a
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
non- gerain amendment in
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
judiciary um I heard several individuals
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
on this committee prior mentioned that
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
this bill should have been in judiciary
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
to begin with which
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
after unfortunately after our our
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
hearing I kind of agree with so for now
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
it'll be over in judiciary or they they
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
asked us not to exec I'll leave it at
 
01:15:35.629 --> 01:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
PRI uh Mr chairman wouldn't the more
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate would be to uh take this to
 
01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:44.910 align:start position:0%
appropriate would be to uh take this to
interim

01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
study what we will do is do nothing at
 
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
this point because we
 
01:15:54.669 --> 01:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
want if they fail to do
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
anything over there
 
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
um I know where you're going
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I know where you're going with that
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
however um I was asked by the chair of
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary if I would not exec this today
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
and and I'm going
 
01:16:16.629 --> 01:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
to at some point again if things don't
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
go as we would like to see I I think
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's we'll act on it within committee
 
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:23.669 align:start position:0%
that's we'll act on it within committee
lat

01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
lat
 
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
thank you represent stav thank you Mr
 
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
chair and try to be brief with this a
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
previous bill that we had that the
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor requested that we not go forward
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
with it we voted to itl that
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
bill what is the difference here simply
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
because the chair of judicial Affairs
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
requested it rather than the sponsor and
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
how how do we as a committee that now
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
now owns this bill get to track the
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
progress of the bill without attending
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
every judicial Affairs hearing I'm just
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that not so much that that
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
committee won't do anything but what
 
01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
they might actually do after we've had
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing and raised questions
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
and had our own thoughts about it and I
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
am sympathetic to exactly what you're
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
saying and what representative priest
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
said before thank you uh
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
do you have a question representative
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
McDonald no oh Mike's on okay
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative k um just would it be
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate first to make a motion to
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
retain the bill can we do that to
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves retains are not allowed in the
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
second year would be interim study as
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative priest mentioned but I
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to bring the the bill up
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
for exec session
 
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
today representative Brown thank you Mr
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
procedurally as the chairman you can you
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
can can do this or do we have to vote on
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
this not I can do that we're just I'm
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
not bringing the bill forward for exec
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
you okay and with all of that uh we will
 
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
move on to HB
 
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
1544 relative to indemnification for
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities adopting policies to
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
address uh
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
homelessness and I believe
 
01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
representative stavis has a
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gallagher do you have
 
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment propos um yes I do but all
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
right so I had my own Amendment drafted
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
ahead of time which I distributed at the
 
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing last night via email
 
01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
um I received um or I think we all
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
received um an amendment from um
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative grassy
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
um about how he wishes uh for us to
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
amend the bill um I think um it would be
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
good to consider both of them but I'm
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
not really sure how to proceed like um
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
what the order should be here whether we
 
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
should do mine first or his first or um
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah to avoid confusion and just so
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
we can have longer to um consider
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
amendments I'm going to the same thing
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
that representative priest did with the
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
previous Bill and instead move that uh
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
we go to interim study on the
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
bill very good representative Gallagher
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
is there a second on the interim study
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:20:00.189 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
is there any uh discussion
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
on HP
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
1544 represent power so just to clarify
 
01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking on the motion to interim
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
study correct that is correct okay so
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
the reason uh I agreed with uh
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher on the interim
 
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
study I had some significant concerns
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
with the actual bill um last year we had
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
a bill come forward uh which really
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
talked about I'm not going to call it
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
temporary housing I going to call it
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
transitional housing and it really came
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
up that larger uh
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities that had particularly if
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
they had Hotel uh space were really
 
01:20:42.669 --> 01:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
bearing the brunt of transitional
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
housing and they were asking for other
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
communities that were that had residents
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
that they were shipping to them that
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
they were paying their fair share of it
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
and so so I think that's the underlying
 
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
issue that we have with transitional
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
housing I think the bill itself in terms
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
of talking about the barrier of uh
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
legally to creating that temporary
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
housing is an interesting one but I
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot more work that needs
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
to be done on what that transitional
 
01:21:11.709 --> 01:21:11.719 align:start position:0%
housing looks like and so I think it
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
would help if we did an interim study
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
that we could clarify that and would
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
make the bill better as it came back to
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
us thank you representative uh further
 
01:21:21.639 --> 01:21:23.790 align:start position:0%
us thank you representative uh further

01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
requiring large parking lots to have a
 
01:23:37.229 --> 01:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
solar power canopy we will open up the
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
exess session on that I believe
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative stavis you have a motion
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%

01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:56.750 align:start position:0%
second on that all kinds of seconds
representative

01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hicks and would you like to speak to
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
that representative stavis thank you Mr
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
chair if I can get rid of this frog in
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
my throat I'd love to speak to
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
it I think that the um the intent of
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is a good one um there is much
 
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
to be gained from
 
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
utilizing what you could call empty
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
spaces for solar arrays but I thought
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
that wasn't well thought out enough in
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
terms of it
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
technicalities there was no mention of
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know little things like net metering
 
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
and how is that monitored and who uses
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
the electricity generated from these
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
solar arrays and how do planning and
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
zoning boards account for this when they
 
01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:41.719 align:start position:0%
are considering projects for say
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
housing uh so um given all of the work
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
that needs to go into this
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned bill I'm nonetheless
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
moving to itl thank you representative
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
further comments uh representative
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
priest Mr chairman thank you for um
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledging me um I will also be
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
voting to itl this even though I am a
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
very strong supporter of solar energy I
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
just think um this has many questions
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
that are not answered and um I think
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
this really would be a burden on local
 
01:25:23.629 --> 01:25:23.639 align:start position:0%
governments as well as private business
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
without having some funding identified
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh for this implementation thank you
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments represent
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um I agree that the uh bill
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
could use some work um but I just think
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
that um we could do like we have with
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
the previous bills and that um interim
 
01:25:53.109 --> 01:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
study might be a better Avenue for
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
working out some of these issues
 
01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
identified with it so um I'll
 
01:26:00.669 --> 01:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
respectfully be voting against the itl
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
motion thank you representative further
 
01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
comments representative Holland so I'm
 
01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:07.719 align:start position:0%
going to support the itl motion uh just
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
because uh I think there's a lot of
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
problems with this in terms of uh the
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
state imposing the solar um in Durham we
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
actually did build a solar canopy we did
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
it on our school uh because the site was
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
so small we had actually filled the
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
entire uh roof of the building with
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
solar and we just didn't and we still
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
needed more capacity to run our heat
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
pumps and the only place we could do it
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
was by doing a solar canopy and it's the
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
most expensive way to do solar um my
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
concern with this is especially in uh
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
the bill we w we would very rapidly all
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
of our parking spaces would become
 
01:26:50.109 --> 01:26:50.119 align:start position:0%
Static because we'd be sticking solar
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
over them so it would really inhibit the
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
ability of the municipality to begin to
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
think about how they're going to
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
restructure or work on their uh their
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
downtown areas or a lot of their areas
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I think last session uh
 
01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative stavis represent uh
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
presented a bill that really spoke to
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
putting it in the master plan and the
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
planning process and I think that's the
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
location that this really uh should go
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
and I don't think putting this bill in
 
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
interim study will get us there so again
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
I support the itl thank you
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%

large parking facilities can already do
 
01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
what this bill sets forward to do
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
without this
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%

01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
FN okay we're down to our last one exact
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
bill for the morning that will be HB
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
1396 relative to prohibiting Municipal
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
inspections of owner occupied
 
01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
units of uh multi-unit housing we'll
 
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
open up the ex session on that and I
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
believe representative yella has a
 
01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:19.639 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I move ought
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
to pass is that second
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
I second that Mr chairman representative
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
Brown seconds that motion uh
 
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative yull would you like to
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion sure thank you um I
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
think that that um the property right
 
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
issue is an important one and protecting
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
of um your property rights uh is
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
something that we should uh encourage in
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
this committee and I think that um just
 
01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
because you choose to rent out other
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
units you should not have reduced uh
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
control over your own unit um and I
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
believe that there is
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
some the the claims for uh you know the
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
sky is falling because of of safety I
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
think that uh the people that uh are
 
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
in condos which share walls with people
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
that they don't know or have any
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
relationship with um share that
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
same uh quote risk if you if you uh
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
believe that there is such a risk um and
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
those people in the condos don't lose
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
their their property rights and so I
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe these people in the
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
renting structure should lose those
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
property rights even though um the exact
 
01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.350 align:start position:0%
property rights even though um the exact
same

01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
building uh with the exact same
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
structure and all of that um could be in
 
01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
either of those cases a a rental unit or
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh a condo and so uh since the structure
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
is literally the same it's just the
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
ownership that is different um I don't
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
see one being given preferential treat
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
treatment as uh in accordance to
 
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
property rights as being
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
um um commensurate with our our uh right
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
to privacy in our constitution so thank
 
01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you representative
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
Joe Kella are there any further
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
priest yes I would
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
um oppose what the previous speaker has
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
stated I think the health and
 
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
safety of the residents in these units
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
are more important than the property
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
rights of the owner occupied unit thank
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you further comments
 
01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.149 align:start position:0%
you thank you further comments
representative

01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:58.750 --> 01:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
Brown U although I tend to agree with
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative priest about the property
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
owner's rights that are renting I also
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
look at this from the point of view of
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
if you own a townhouse that has a common
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
wall those those people are separate
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
owners of the property and they don't do
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
don't get inspected for the same type of
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
reasons thank you represent
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
svis thank you Mr chair just um as a
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
condominium owner myself and knowing
 
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
many condominium owners they are in fact
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
liable for risks to the common area if
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
they share a roof if somebody else's
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
roof goes bad everybody pays for that
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
roof uh and it's a risk to everyone so
 
01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
that is actually in fact not true that
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
um condominium owners are exempt from
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
this kind of
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
inspection further comments uh
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
K yeah I totally agree with my colleague
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative priest you know um
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
having worked in the uh constru industry
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
my whole life I understand inspecting a
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
firewalls and things like that and what
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
can go wrong on the other side of a wall
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
um people can drill holes in walls we we
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
heard lots of testimony when this bill
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
came before us last year and and now um
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
of the safety concerns and security
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
concerns and I I will be voting against
 
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.830 align:start position:0%
concerns and I I will be voting against
the

01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
OTP representative Helen so again we did
 
01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
hear this last year and I I think when
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
the bill arose the concern really was
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
that a municipality would put forward a
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
yearly inspection and they' come forward
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then and the homeowner or the the
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
owner occupied was like wait a second
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
why am I being uh inspected every year I
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
think the concern that was raised in the
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing really would be if the
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
owner occupied pulled a permit to do
 
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
something on their unit that this bill
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the code enforcement to
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
come and look at it so to put that in
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
perspective I I'm a single family
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
homeowner if I pull a
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
permit they're going to come inspect my
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
unit it's like that's part of the
 
01:34:13.229 --> 01:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
process and so I think this so in terms
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
of property rights I I I mean I by me
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
pulling a permit I'm asking you know
 
01:34:19.709 --> 01:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
that part of the process is they're
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
going to inspect it to make sure it
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
meets code and so I think this inhibits
 
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
the code enforcement I mean while I do
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
understand the difficulty of the yearly
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
thing and maybe that could be addressed
 
01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
in the future the next time this bill
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
comes forward the actual code
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement we don't want to weaken so I
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
I think that we want to itl this
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:55.709 align:start position:0%
 
comments

01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%

uh we will take
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
a 10
 
01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
minute caucus for the
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
Republicans so we do that with Amendment
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
with a motion on the floor I'm sorry Mr
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
chair I don't know that's a good
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%

according to the clerk um if we were in
 
01:37:22.109 --> 01:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
the middle of a vote no we cannot in
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
fact take a recess or quick break if we
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%

01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar so representative
 
01:55:38.589 --> 01:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
priest the motion maker I'll you'll do
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
the blurb on that on the itel motion
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
representative yo Kella probably did the
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
same thing you will do the blur for do
 
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
you want me to change the one that I
 
01:55:49.229 --> 01:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
already gave you might have to reward it
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit but other than that yes so
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
you'll do that that's fine
 
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:57.390 align:start position:0%
you'll do that that's fine
okay

01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
so uh with that I think we are closed on
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
1396 all right so here is
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
forward so we're doing good on time time
 
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
we are scheduled to be back at
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
1 uh I'll ask that you be back at about
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
110 and here's the reason uh the prime
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor of
 
01:56:36.069 --> 01:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
1317 has agreed to merge his bill in
 
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
with a previous Bill we've heard so uh
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
he's asked that we itl that so that'll
 
01:56:44.350 --> 01:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
be a quick one so at 110 we'll have
 
01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
everybody back however before you leave
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
couple couple things that uh would like
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
to to go over uh based
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
on most of it is regarding when we're
 
01:56:58.510 --> 01:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here as a committee Andor
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
especially during uh when we have
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
individuals testifying up there um
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
remember that when somebody
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
testifies the questions that we can ask
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
them are based on their testimony okay
 
01:57:17.069 --> 01:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
so in other words we we don't go off
 
01:57:19.149 --> 01:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
into the Weeds on other items that are
 
01:57:21.149 --> 01:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
in directly related to their testimony
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
if you want further Clarity on their
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
testimony or something like that but we
 
01:57:29.470 --> 01:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
got to keep it on topic um I've been a
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
little LAX in in keeping people in line
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
on that and last week we went very long
 
01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
on some of the bills where we really
 
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
um let's see the other thing that was
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
brought up to me by a few individuals
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
was it's up to this committee when you
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
we come to hit uh to our hearings
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%

individuals given the
 
01:58:04.069 --> 01:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
testimony listen to the
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%

01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
think you guys pretty much know it when
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
I call on individuals to ask questions
 
01:58:58.950 --> 01:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever I I go from Republican
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
Democrat Republican Democrat if you've
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
already spoken once I'm going to bypass
 
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
you and go to somebody who hasn't spoken
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
um you don't have once I you put your
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
hand up and I acknowledge you and I see
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
you you can put your hand down I know
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%

you and if I forget then frantically
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
wave at me so other than that um if you
 
01:59:20.990 --> 01:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
have any questions represent
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
s yeah I would like to respectfully ask
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
if this is something the chair thinks is
 
01:59:29.709 --> 01:59:29.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate that members of the
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee when listening to people
 
01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
presenting bills or testimony
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
hold this kind of gesture until the
 
01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
person is done with their testimony I I
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
I just feel that it's rude and it's a
 
01:59:47.709 --> 01:59:47.719 align:start position:0%
sign that we're not really listening if
 
01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
we've got our hands in the air and the
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
person is still speaking which goes to
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro County District
 
03:23:56.630 --> 03:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
36 to begin this bill was filed upon the
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
request of a large group of concerned
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
citizens this is a straightforward
 
03:24:04.950 --> 03:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
Common Sense Bill the purpose of this
 
03:24:07.870 --> 03:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
bill is to prohibit municipalities from
 
03:24:11.630 --> 03:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
enacting and enforcing ordinances that
 
03:24:14.429 --> 03:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
restrict the number of unrelated
 
03:24:18.349 --> 03:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
occupants living in a residential rental
 
03:24:20.510 --> 03:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
property the problem that this bill
 
03:24:23.990 --> 03:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
seeks to address is this currently some
 
03:24:26.950 --> 03:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities have enacted ordinances
 
03:24:30.469 --> 03:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
that arbitrarily and unreasonably limit
 
03:24:32.950 --> 03:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
the number of unrelated occupants
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to rent a residential dwelling
 
03:24:40.030 --> 03:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
unit for example in some municipalities
 
03:24:43.110 --> 03:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
a landlord owning a five-bedroom house
 
03:24:46.189 --> 03:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
is prohibited by local ordinances from
 
03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
renting the property to no more than
 
03:24:52.110 --> 03:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
three unrelated renters when clearly the
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
house can reasonably accommodate at
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
least five unrelated renters that's one
 
03:25:02.189 --> 03:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
occupant per bedroom also consider that
 
03:25:04.910 --> 03:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
the landlord as well as the prospective
 
03:25:07.990 --> 03:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
renters may both be comfortable with two

living in this five-bedroom
 
03:25:17.429 --> 03:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
house in this example local ordinances
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
have the effect of artificially
 
03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
eliminating housing opportunities for
 
03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
seven people seeking housing
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
unmistakably local Z zoning ordinances
 
03:25:32.910 --> 03:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
that restrict the number of unrelated
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
occupants living in a residential rental
 
03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
property are highly problematic in many
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
ways first and foremost most overly
 
03:25:46.189 --> 03:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
restrictive ordinances constitute
 
03:25:48.790 --> 03:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
infringement by government upon the
 
03:25:51.670 --> 03:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
property rights of individuals to freely
 
03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
utilize their property as they see fit
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
in a responsible manner that does not
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
pose any Genuine Health and or safety
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
concerns furthermore if health and
 
03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
safety is the alleged basis for such
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
ordinances then it would logically
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
follow that such restrictions on
 
03:26:17.429 --> 03:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
residential property should apply to all
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
residences whether privately owned or
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
rented in practice this is unmistakably
 
03:26:27.670 --> 03:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
not the case to be clear households of
 
03:26:31.750 --> 03:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
related persons are not subject to these
 
03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
particular restrictive
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
ordinances second overreaching
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances imposed by m municipalities
 
03:26:42.429 --> 03:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
that go beyond health and safety is one
 
03:26:45.189 --> 03:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
example of land use ordinances that
 
03:26:48.110 --> 03:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
negatively impacts both affordability
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
and supply of housing in the granite
 
03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
state by arbitrarily re restricting the
 
03:26:56.510 --> 03:26:56.520 align:start position:0%

03:26:58.269 --> 03:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
preavis
 
03:27:00.670 --> 03:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
housing currently New Hampshire has an
 
03:27:03.630 --> 03:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
inadequate supply of affordable housing
 
03:27:05.550 --> 03:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
not to mention a severe shortage of
 
03:27:08.550 --> 03:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
rental housing to be clear restrictive
 
03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
ordinances drive up rental costs and
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
they reduce the number of housing units
 
03:27:15.710 --> 03:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
further compounding the Hampshire's
 
03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:16.750 align:start position:0%
further compounding the Hampshire's
housing

03:27:16.750 --> 03:27:16.760 align:start position:0%

03:27:20.590 --> 03:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
crisis in 2023 for a two-bedroom rental
 
03:27:24.389 --> 03:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
Statewide there was a 6 vacancy with a
 
03:27:28.790 --> 03:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:32.030 --> 03:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
$1,764 third these types of restrictive
 
03:27:34.830 --> 03:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances are unfair to say the very
 
03:27:37.870 --> 03:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
least sadly I heard from one property
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
landlord who shared with me that he had
 
03:27:41.910 --> 03:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
a house available
 
03:27:44.670 --> 03:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
for rent that four unrelated black men
 
03:27:47.510 --> 03:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to rent together this property
 
03:27:49.630 --> 03:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
could have more than easily accommodated
 
03:27:52.990 --> 03:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
all four men providing them with housing
 
03:27:54.990 --> 03:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
when the property owner explained to the
 
03:27:57.870 --> 03:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
men that he couldn't rent to them
 
03:28:00.590 --> 03:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
because the town restricted all rentals
 
03:28:03.710 --> 03:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
to no more than three unrelated people
 
03:28:06.269 --> 03:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
the men legitimately thought that the LA
 
03:28:09.189 --> 03:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
landlord was being discriminatory and
 
03:28:11.830 --> 03:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
racist towards them because the men
 
03:28:14.710 --> 03:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
explained that they knew of eight
 
03:28:17.469 --> 03:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
unrelated Chinese restaurant workers
 
03:28:19.950 --> 03:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
living together in a rental house in the
 
03:28:23.590 --> 03:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
very same town fourth consider the many
 
03:28:26.269 --> 03:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
reasons for which unrelated individuals
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
might seek to share housing college
 
03:28:31.469 --> 03:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
students share housing in order to be
 
03:28:34.870 --> 03:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
able to afford room board and
 
03:28:37.510 --> 03:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
tuition working Professionals of all
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
ages may share housing to reduce
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
expenses and others might find
 
03:28:44.830 --> 03:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
themselves in difficult situations such
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
as persons widowed divorced or retired
 
03:28:51.150 --> 03:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
people living on fixed or low incomes
 
03:28:53.189 --> 03:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
people who have downsized or who are
 
03:28:55.750 --> 03:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing loss of employment the
 
03:28:58.269 --> 03:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
elderly and the disabled are about a few
 
03:29:00.790 --> 03:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
examples to come to to that come to my
 
03:29:03.510 --> 03:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
mind these groups of people may choose
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
and even need to share housing costs and
 
03:29:09.429 --> 03:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
expenses in order to avoid
 
03:29:11.710 --> 03:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
homelessness Now understand that New
 
03:29:14.510 --> 03:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a Dylan's rural State
 
03:29:16.790 --> 03:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
accordingly a local government's
 
03:29:19.830 --> 03:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate housing occupancy
 
03:29:23.710 --> 03:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
is derived from the power granted by the
 
03:29:26.790 --> 03:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
state legislature to protect health
 
03:29:28.990 --> 03:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
safety and general
 
03:29:32.189 --> 03:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
welfare thus when this local Authority
 
03:29:34.870 --> 03:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
is used in a manner that is blatantly
 
03:29:38.030 --> 03:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
overreaching and extends Beyond these
 
03:29:40.630 --> 03:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
expressed objectives then it is
 
03:29:42.990 --> 03:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
incumbent M upon the state legislature
 
03:29:46.189 --> 03:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
to intervene on behalf of its citizens
 
03:29:48.670 --> 03:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
for this reason this bill provides the
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate guard rails to local use
 
03:29:54.309 --> 03:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
planning and Regulatory powers granted
 
03:29:56.910 --> 03:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
by the state legislature to
 
03:29:59.550 --> 03:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities next this brings us to
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
the solution to the obvious problem this
 
03:30:04.790 --> 03:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill before you adds a new paragraph
 
03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:09.760 align:start position:0%

03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%

prohibiting municipalities from enacting

residential rental property this bill
 
03:31:07.389 --> 03:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
will uphold the inherent rights of
 
03:31:10.469 --> 03:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
property owners guard against unfair
 
03:31:13.150 --> 03:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
practices and unwarranted discrimination
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
in rental housing increase the supply of
 
03:31:19.070 --> 03:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
pre-existing housing which in turn will
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully help to lower rental costs for
 
03:31:25.030 --> 03:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
granite Staters Mr chairman that
 
03:31:27.309 --> 03:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
concludes my Bill intro introduction I'm
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions relative
 
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
to the bill language itself however in
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
the interest of time I'd recommend that
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
all other questions be deferred to
 
03:31:41.189 --> 03:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
expert Witnesses and others here to
 
03:31:44.950 --> 03:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
testify on this Bill thank you thank you
 
03:31:45.950 --> 03:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representa power
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative y
 
03:31:51.510 --> 03:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:31:54.269 --> 03:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
for taking the question it seemed from
 
03:31:56.670 --> 03:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony that
 
03:32:00.990 --> 03:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
you were advocating for
 
03:32:04.030 --> 03:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
restricting uh discrimination by
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities based on familial status
 
03:32:10.429 --> 03:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
but it seemed that the language that you
 
03:32:13.309 --> 03:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
described only said that they couldn't
 
03:32:17.070 --> 03:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
restrict it to X number of non-related
 
03:32:21.790 --> 03:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
employees or uh tenants and not uh an
 
03:32:24.429 --> 03:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
outright prohibition on discrimination
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
based on familiar status why did you um
 
03:32:31.630 --> 03:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
not go all the way to just say no
 
03:32:34.070 --> 03:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination at all thank you for the
 
03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I don't really
 
03:32:41.070 --> 03:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
understand your question and in my my
 
03:32:45.189 --> 03:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
mind it it's it's very clear to me that
 
03:32:47.110 --> 03:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
and as I described with regards to the
 
03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill language it
 
03:32:52.830 --> 03:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
itself I addressed the issue of some
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities having ordinances on the
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
books that restrict the number of
 
03:32:58.000 --> 03:32:59.630 align:start position:0%
books that restrict the number of
unrelated

03:32:59.630 --> 03:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
unrelated
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
renters and I put in a a reasonable um
 
03:33:08.110 --> 03:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
alternative to a to a blank check to
 
03:33:12.630 --> 03:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
that and additionally I I took another
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
step to potentially close a loophole in
 
03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
response to this and said that no
 
03:33:23.670 --> 03:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
municipality May enact and enforce an
 
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
ordinance that requires familial
 
03:33:31.309 --> 03:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:34.830 --> 03:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
rent I hope that that answers your
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:41.710 --> 03:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
understand represent
 
03:33:44.469 --> 03:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
03:33:46.670 --> 03:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for being here
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
how many communities in New Hampshire
 
03:33:52.030 --> 03:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
would you guess is are putting
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions on Residential Properties
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's a very
 
03:33:58.510 --> 03:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
interesting question
 
03:34:02.349 --> 03:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
so back in the fall I went to the
 
03:34:05.150 --> 03:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
research Department here in conquer and
 
03:34:07.389 --> 03:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
I sat down with them in person and
 
03:34:11.429 --> 03:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
requested that um research be done
 
03:34:14.349 --> 03:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
to answer that question for some unknown
 
03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
reason I never got any response for them
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
so therefore I needed to conduct the
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:31.189 --> 03:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
um I didn't look at every single
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
municipality in New Hampshire due to
 
03:34:38.670 --> 03:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
time and when I did with from the
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
research that I did um do I identified
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
seven and I'm happy to um pass that
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
hearing followup representative PRI yes
 
03:34:59.309 --> 03:34:59.319 align:start position:0%
and did you take an account the parking
 
03:35:02.189 --> 03:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
requirements for these Residential
 
03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
Properties and if you open it up to two
 
03:35:08.590 --> 03:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
people per bedroom unrelated how many
 
03:35:10.950 --> 03:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
what what would be the impact of these
 
03:35:13.229 --> 03:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
Residential Properties thank you for the
 
03:35:15.309 --> 03:35:15.319 align:start position:0%
question representative my focus in
 
03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
filing this bill was specifically on the
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
the Restriction in ordinances with
 
03:35:25.189 --> 03:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
regards to the number of of individuals
 
03:35:27.070 --> 03:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
that were unrelated that could could
 
03:35:28.750 --> 03:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
rent that was my
 
03:35:32.309 --> 03:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
focus I did not I understand that
 
03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's a parking Factor but
 
03:35:38.309 --> 03:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
like I said I focused on the use of the
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
property and the property rights of the
 
03:35:43.189 --> 03:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
owner representative Brown thank you Mr
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you represent of power
 
03:35:51.550 --> 03:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions and as you
 
03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
indicated before you might have some
 
03:35:54.790 --> 03:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
experts that are going to be able to
 
03:35:58.229 --> 03:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
testify to this so maybe you can let me
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
know if they're going to do this concern
 
03:36:05.030 --> 03:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
about septic systems fire ESS and what
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
the typical occupancy might be on a
 
03:36:11.790 --> 03:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom home um so you could look
 
03:36:13.830 --> 03:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
at what the total number of people might
 
03:36:17.550 --> 03:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
be occupying a space would be from a
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
kind of zoning safety Public Safety type
 
03:36:19.760 --> 03:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
kind of zoning safety Public Safety type
of

03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
issue thank you representative for the
 
03:36:28.910 --> 03:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
question so um we it's my understanding
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
that when you know when you have a house
 
03:36:34.150 --> 03:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's completely
 
03:36:36.870 --> 03:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable that two
 
03:36:40.110 --> 03:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
people should reasonably be able to to
 
03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
occup occupy um you know a bedroom space
 
03:36:46.710 --> 03:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
and while I'm not a home builder it is
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
also my understanding that when homes
 
03:36:53.150 --> 03:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
are built with with bedrooms that that
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
is most likely the um I guess the
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
calculus or a requirement that goes into
 
03:37:05.950 --> 03:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
when a builder builds a home as to how a
 
03:37:08.670 --> 03:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
septic system is going to be sized
 
03:37:12.189 --> 03:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
therefore my bill will have no adverse
 
03:37:15.990 --> 03:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
impacts with regards to um septic
 
03:37:19.189 --> 03:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
furthermore if these properties are in
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have
 
03:37:24.630 --> 03:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
public sewer that would not be a con you
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
know that would not be a a consider a
 
03:37:29.790 --> 03:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
factor if you
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
will thank you representative
 
03:37:35.630 --> 03:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:37:39.309 --> 03:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um is it your
 
03:37:40.990 --> 03:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
03:37:44.590 --> 03:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
the relational status of individuals
 
03:37:47.150 --> 03:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
living in rental housing has any impact
 
03:37:50.349 --> 03:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
whatsoever on septic or sewer
 
03:37:52.269 --> 03:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
capacity thank you for the question
 
03:37:52.279 --> 03:37:53.870 align:start position:0%
capacity thank you for the question
representative

03:37:53.870 --> 03:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
um whether people are unrelated or or
 
03:38:02.110 --> 03:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
related they're they're individuals and
 
03:38:05.309 --> 03:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
I don't see how that's going to change
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:38:21.750 --> 03:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I really have two
 
03:38:24.070 --> 03:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
related one has already been asked that
 
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
about the septic system I suggest to you
 
03:38:30.030 --> 03:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
would this would have a big impact uh
 
03:38:33.309 --> 03:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
but I'm concerned about the social
 
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
impact if this could re could could not
 
03:38:43.309 --> 03:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
this bill uh result in having say a a
 
03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
condominium with I don't know eight or
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
10 units and you got 50 people living in
 
03:38:52.750 --> 03:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
there and then and you know and there's
 
03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
no control over over that over a period
 
03:39:00.750 --> 03:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
impact thank you for the question
 
03:39:04.510 --> 03:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative so to
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
reiterate this
 
03:39:06.720 --> 03:39:09.229 align:start position:0%
reiterate this
bill

03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:39:10.910 align:start position:0%
bill
specifies

03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
specifies
 
03:39:14.710 --> 03:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
that there may not be that it guarantees
 
03:39:19.229 --> 03:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
and allows up to two people per bedroom
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
if the landlord you know has a
 
03:39:22.269 --> 03:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
five-bedroom house and they just want to
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
rent it to one person they they can
 
03:39:26.110 --> 03:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
still rent it to one
 
03:39:30.150 --> 03:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
person the bill prohibits unreasonable
 
03:39:32.990 --> 03:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions placed on property
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
owners through ordinances so again to
 
03:39:38.830 --> 03:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
reiterate two persons per bedroom is
 
03:39:41.710 --> 03:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable that that's not
 
03:39:44.429 --> 03:39:44.439 align:start position:0%
that's not stuffing 50 people into a
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
house and so you know to answer your
 
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
second question I I don't see that there
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
would be some social you know
 
03:39:56.189 --> 03:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
impact if this bill were to be signed in
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:04.429 --> 03:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
answers representative
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:40:09.550 --> 03:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this just the the
 
03:40:15.790 --> 03:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
grammatically and I uh tell me that I'm
 
03:40:19.630 --> 03:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
wrong when I read it uh let's see uh
 
03:40:22.189 --> 03:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
lines four to
 
03:40:25.950 --> 03:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
five uh or six you list off a city Town
 
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
Village District or county in which
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
there are located unincorporated towns
 
03:40:31.550 --> 03:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
or or unorganized
 
03:40:35.710 --> 03:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
places um when I'm looking at this to me
 
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
it means all of those things that have
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places or do you mean
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
just a county that has unincorporated
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
places it's the comma business thank you
 
03:40:49.309 --> 03:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
for the yeah thank you for the question
 
03:40:52.750 --> 03:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative um I appreciate that so
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
um OSS drafted this bill and it was
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
drafted by a uh an attorney who special
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
specializes in Municipal law so um it's
 
03:41:08.110 --> 03:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
there it's their wording so um to answer
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
your question the way that I read it is
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
is that the words on line six refer back
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
to County it's a modifying the word
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
County yeah okay thank
 
03:41:23.149 --> 03:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
you further
 
03:41:25.429 --> 03:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
questions I have one representative
 
03:41:27.510 --> 03:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
power that came
 
03:41:30.309 --> 03:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
up when you started talking about uh
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
five bedroom homes it started I started
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
having visions of some of these old
 
03:41:37.389 --> 03:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
Victorian houses with five six seven
 
03:41:37.399 --> 03:41:39.030 align:start position:0%
Victorian houses with five six seven
eight

03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
eight
 
03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:40.790 align:start position:0%
eight
bedrooms

03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
bedrooms
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the answer to this
 
03:41:45.990 --> 03:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
would as you start filling those
 
03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
bedrooms with two people per bedroom do
 
03:41:53.229 --> 03:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
we start getting into a scenario of a
 
03:41:56.590 --> 03:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
boarding house situation and are
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
there laws and regulations against that
 
03:42:05.189 --> 03:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question chairman so
 
03:42:07.750 --> 03:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
um when I was doing the research with

as I was looking through the zoning or
 
03:42:16.189 --> 03:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
ordinances to answer your question that
 
03:42:19.389 --> 03:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
would have to do with the definition of
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
a boarding
 
03:42:20.560 --> 03:42:22.110 align:start position:0%
a boarding
house

03:42:22.110 --> 03:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
and given any particular Town how how do
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
they Define a boarding house so I can't
 
03:42:31.590 --> 03:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
answer that that question it it would
 
03:42:34.269 --> 03:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
have to be on a case-by casee basis

for your time today um I'd actually like
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
to start off with answering some of the
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
questions maybe a little bit more um
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
that were just previously asked so um
 
03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
with respect to parking um there's
 
03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
already existing was it you that asked
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
about parking there's already existing
 
03:43:38.149 --> 03:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
parking service parking surface rules
 
03:43:39.910 --> 03:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
setback regulations that will already
 
03:43:41.309 --> 03:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
limit that I'm actually going to speak
 
03:43:44.510 --> 03:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
to the extent at which they have uh the
 
03:43:46.990 --> 03:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
town that I live in Durham has gone to
 
03:43:49.590 --> 03:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually go above and beyond um handling
 
03:43:51.990 --> 03:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
the cars so there's other ways that they
 
03:43:55.469 --> 03:43:55.479 align:start position:0%
can manage that um the septic most of
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
the um someone over here asked about SE
 
03:44:01.389 --> 03:44:01.399 align:start position:0%
most of the properties that are subject
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
to this are on Town Water and Sewer so
 
03:44:07.630 --> 03:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be an issue as
 
03:44:10.349 --> 03:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
well um I'm going to just what I had
 
03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
prepared now some of it is
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
um in conjunction to what Diane has
 
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
already mentioned um but it's first
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
person testimony for myself so um going
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
to give it now so representatives of the
 
03:44:24.110 --> 03:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
house Municipal and County government
 
03:44:26.269 --> 03:44:26.279 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jeff Berlin I thank
 
03:44:28.750 --> 03:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
you for your time today and I'm sorry
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
for any stuttering or misspoken words I
 
03:44:33.189 --> 03:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
am a stakeholder in an issue that for me
 
03:44:35.830 --> 03:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
started as a property rights issue but
 
03:44:38.070 --> 03:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
is since morphed into emotional topics
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
involving Financial hardships of of both
 
03:44:43.149 --> 03:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants abuse of power
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
from Municipal entities stalking Believe
 
03:44:49.309 --> 03:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
It or Not by Municipal representatives
 
03:44:51.750 --> 03:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
lawfare of both tenants and Property
 
03:44:55.790 --> 03:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
Owners trespassing on private property
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
and culminating in the realization that
 
03:45:00.790 --> 03:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue surrounding this bill
 
03:45:03.790 --> 03:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
is actually one of a massive fair
 
03:45:03.800 --> 03:45:05.670 align:start position:0%
is actually one of a massive fair
housing

03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
violation not a violation of law because
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
a person who is required Ed to have a
 
03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
familial relationship with another
 
03:45:14.870 --> 03:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
person in order to live together isn't a
 
03:45:17.950 --> 03:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
protected class under Fair Housing but a
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
violation of decency and fairness which
 
03:45:24.309 --> 03:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
house bill 1281 would
 
03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
correct plainly stated Bill 1281 seeks
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
to Outlaw a city or town from regulating
 
03:45:31.510 --> 03:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
the number of occupants allowed in a
 
03:45:34.990 --> 03:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit based on familial
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
relationship I grew up in Durham about a
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
mile from UNH I went to high school in
 
03:45:39.120 --> 03:45:40.550 align:start position:0%
mile from UNH I went to high school in
Durham

03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
03:45:43.149 --> 03:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
graduated in 2006 and proceeded to
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
attend UNH first semester after that
 
03:45:47.469 --> 03:45:47.479 align:start position:0%
went to endicot college where I majored
 
03:45:50.269 --> 03:45:50.279 align:start position:0%
in Real Estate Management Finance came
 
03:45:52.710 --> 03:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
back to Durham and started working at
 
03:45:54.349 --> 03:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
what at the time was the biggest student
 
03:45:56.229 --> 03:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
housing development uh called the
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
cottages of durm I rented out that
 
03:46:02.269 --> 03:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
property and um then I went off on my
 
03:46:04.670 --> 03:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
own since 2012 I've acquired my broker's
 
03:46:06.910 --> 03:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
license and I currently manage about 250
 
03:46:10.269 --> 03:46:10.279 align:start position:0%
Apartments 20 of which I own myself
 
03:46:11.830 --> 03:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
the very first property I bought was a
 
03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
small three-bedroom one bath ranch home
 
03:46:16.149 --> 03:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
with an accessory dwelling unit in the
 
03:46:18.429 --> 03:46:18.439 align:start position:0%
basement and I will never forget this
 
03:46:20.590 --> 03:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
day because it was the day I was
 
03:46:23.469 --> 03:46:23.479 align:start position:0%
familiarized with DM's code section
 
03:46:27.030 --> 03:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
17556 which reads limitation on number
 
03:46:29.429 --> 03:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
of unrelated occupants within the
 
03:46:31.189 --> 03:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
following zoning districts any dwelling
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
unit consisting of an unrelated
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
household shall contain no more than
 
03:46:36.790 --> 03:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
three unrelated
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
occupants and it goes on to list every
 
03:46:42.269 --> 03:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
Zone in the
 
03:46:44.429 --> 03:46:44.439 align:start position:0%
town what this means and what it was
 
03:46:46.229 --> 03:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
designed for was to limit the number of
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
single family homes rented to groups of
 
03:46:50.830 --> 03:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
friends bigger than three people homes
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
with say four or five bedrooms are not
 
03:46:54.229 --> 03:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to be rented to any more than
 
03:46:56.750 --> 03:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
three students because students are not
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
related even though they could
 
03:47:00.790 --> 03:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
accommodate four or
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
five so let's pause for a second picture
 
03:47:05.790 --> 03:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
me back in 2012 I just graduated at the
 
03:47:08.750 --> 03:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
age of 23 I had my first job at the
 
03:47:10.429 --> 03:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
housing developer
 
03:47:12.790 --> 03:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
and I was netting around $2,100 a month
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
after taxes I just graduated college and
 
03:47:17.950 --> 03:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
at the time at around $80,000 in student
 
03:47:19.950 --> 03:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
loan debt and that monthly payment for
 
03:47:21.990 --> 03:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
that debt was around
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
$1,100 my parents that same year moved
 
03:47:26.510 --> 03:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
from Durham to a new place in Vermont
 
03:47:27.990 --> 03:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
which meant I didn't have a place to
 
03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
live which is why I bought that home
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
with an accessory dwelling unit in the
 
03:47:35.389 --> 03:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
basement I took the only $14,000 I had
 
03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
and I borrowed 500 from my father and I
 
03:47:40.189 --> 03:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
got into a home that I was attempting to
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
house hack I was prepared to live in the
 
03:47:44.670 --> 03:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
basement and hopefully eliminate my
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
housing cost so I could eat as food gas
 
03:47:50.309 --> 03:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
and health insurance ate up the rest of
 
03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
my available $1,000 a month at the time
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
bedrooms were renting believe it or not
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
for $600 a month after I bought the home
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
I was made aware of the fact that if I
 
03:48:01.950 --> 03:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
lived in the basement I could only rent
 
03:48:05.229 --> 03:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
to two of the bedrooms upstairs uh
 
03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
because those people would be unrelated
 
03:48:09.070 --> 03:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
to me so a third would mean I was out of
 
03:48:09.080 --> 03:48:11.110 align:start position:0%
to me so a third would mean I was out of
compliance

03:48:11.110 --> 03:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
03:48:12.269 --> 03:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
this meant that instead of getting
 
03:48:14.189 --> 03:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
$1,800 a month I was only going to be
 
03:48:17.189 --> 03:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
getting ,200 to put towards the mortgage
 
03:48:18.830 --> 03:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
the result was I had to get an extra job
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
and put my student loan debt on hold to
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
grow even
 
03:48:26.070 --> 03:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
bigger 10 years ago I had become
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
resigned to the fact that this is just
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
what it was Durham does not like
 
03:48:31.950 --> 03:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
students and Property Owners subject to
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
this ordinance are just going to have to
 
03:48:37.389 --> 03:48:37.399 align:start position:0%
deal that was until two years ago when
 
03:48:39.710 --> 03:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
two things happened uh one of which I
 
03:48:42.149 --> 03:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
think you'll hear from uh Fred Kell
 
03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
who's here he's going to give you some
 
03:48:47.550 --> 03:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
testimony um but the other was something
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
that happened to me I bought a
 
03:48:51.990 --> 03:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
duplex and attached to the duplex was an
 
03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:53.030 align:start position:0%
duplex and attached to the duplex was an
accessory

03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
accessory
 
03:48:53.040 --> 03:48:54.710 align:start position:0%
accessory
apartment

03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
03:48:57.710 --> 03:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
and um going into this acquisition I
 
03:48:59.149 --> 03:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
knew that based on DM's legal
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
determination of this property I was not
 
03:49:02.469 --> 03:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
allowed to rent the studio to someone
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
unless they were related uh to someone
 
03:49:09.070 --> 03:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
in the primary unit what that meant was
 
03:49:11.189 --> 03:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
the first year I simply just didn't rent
 
03:49:12.870 --> 03:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
the accessory apartment I just rented
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
three individuals in the primary unit
 
03:49:17.349 --> 03:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
and on the other side the second year
 
03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
though I decided to rent the primary
 
03:49:20.189 --> 03:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
unit to only two
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
people instead of three so I could rent
 
03:49:24.030 --> 03:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
the studio at the same
 
03:49:26.590 --> 03:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
time after I had that solved I rented
 
03:49:28.349 --> 03:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
the studio went to rent the
 
03:49:31.630 --> 03:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom on the other side um and I
 
03:49:32.910 --> 03:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
still wasn't free and clear from this
 
03:49:35.429 --> 03:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
unrelated ordinance because I went to
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
rent that three-bedroom I put an ad up
 
03:49:41.469 --> 03:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
um I had a gentleman an international
 
03:49:43.910 --> 03:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
student from Africa uh set up an
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
appointment the next week he came with
 
03:49:47.429 --> 03:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
three of his
 
03:49:49.510 --> 03:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
friends who are also International
 
03:49:52.030 --> 03:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
students from Africa and like Diane had
 
03:49:54.349 --> 03:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
just mentioned I had to tell them that I
 
03:49:56.990 --> 03:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't rent the apartment to them and
 
03:50:00.030 --> 03:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's too long of a story for here but I
 
03:50:01.469 --> 03:50:01.479 align:start position:0%
was accused of a number of different
 
03:50:04.750 --> 03:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
things um none of which were true I
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
actually did want to rent them my unit
 
03:50:10.950 --> 03:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
but the town would not allow me to
 
03:50:12.750 --> 03:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
those poor guys likely had to either
 
03:50:14.910 --> 03:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
split up and pay more for a one or a
 
03:50:18.309 --> 03:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom apartment or move to another
 
03:50:20.269 --> 03:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
town outside of
 
03:50:22.469 --> 03:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
durm and to have that be their first
 
03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
experience in New Hampshire made me so
 
03:50:26.950 --> 03:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
angry that's when I contacted Diane and
 
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
a bunch of students at UNH to support to
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
build support for a bill such as House
 
03:50:31.840 --> 03:50:34.110 align:start position:0%
build support for a bill such as House
Bill

03:50:34.110 --> 03:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:50:37.469 --> 03:50:37.479 align:start position:0%
1281 so why does Durham and other towns
 
03:50:39.550 --> 03:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
like Durham put this into effect effect
 
03:50:41.309 --> 03:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
in the first
 
03:50:45.070 --> 03:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
place I'd like to read um a gentleman's
 
03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
statements from the online testimony it
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
was the only one who wrote in an
 
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill his name was
 
03:50:52.680 --> 03:50:54.790 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill his name was
Richard

03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
Richard
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
Menny and he said excuse me uh sir yes
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
um if this testimony is online testimony
 
03:51:04.670 --> 03:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
of somebody else we have already have
 
03:51:06.990 --> 03:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
access to it we don't think we don't
 
03:51:09.229 --> 03:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
need to reiterate it here we need to
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
hear your testimony not the testimony of
 
03:51:13.229 --> 03:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
others okay thank you yeah I was just
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
giving it as to give you the perspective
 
03:51:19.990 --> 03:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
of why they your testimony please okay
 
03:51:22.670 --> 03:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
um so I won't quote him but um based on
 
03:51:24.750 --> 03:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
Richard's statements sounds like he's
 
03:51:26.590 --> 03:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
saying that if this doesn't go through
 
03:51:29.030 --> 03:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we will I'm
 
03:51:31.870 --> 03:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
sorry it's not his testimony we want to
 
03:51:34.189 --> 03:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
hear your testimony on as to why you
 
03:51:36.189 --> 03:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
think that this bill should go forward
 
03:51:36.199 --> 03:51:38.149 align:start position:0%
think that this bill should go forward
sir

03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
sir
 
03:51:38.159 --> 03:51:49.269 align:start position:0%
sir
okay

03:51:49.269 --> 03:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
I support this bill because
 
03:51:57.389 --> 03:51:57.399 align:start position:0%
um what the opposite of it uh seeks to
 
03:52:00.510 --> 03:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
solve is a noise trash and traffic issue
 
03:52:02.750 --> 03:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
in these towns I have no issue with this
 
03:52:05.309 --> 03:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
endeavor for clean and peaceful streets
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
every city should want this in durm
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
though it's a bit redundant because we
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
already have laws
 
03:52:14.950 --> 03:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
supporting uh violations for noise and
 
03:52:18.309 --> 03:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
trash as crazy it sounds uh their most
 
03:52:19.750 --> 03:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
coherent reason for wanting to limit
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
students residing in neighborhoods is
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
their desire to limit car traffic and
 
03:52:24.750 --> 03:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
reckless driving it's a legitimate
 
03:52:26.110 --> 03:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
concern in my opinion though
 
03:52:29.389 --> 03:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
implementing rules around cars linking
 
03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
it to the unrelated ordinance has been a
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
desperate power grab for the town for
 
03:52:34.630 --> 03:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
years seeing originally they didn't
 
03:52:35.950 --> 03:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
address the cars as part of their
 
03:52:38.189 --> 03:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
unrelated ordinance and since residents
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
have guessed with cars they found them
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
themselves in a new battle with
 
03:52:45.550 --> 03:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
cars so what did they do over time they
 
03:52:47.469 --> 03:52:47.479 align:start position:0%
drafted and voted on rules that limit
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
cars first they limited the number of
 
03:52:51.389 --> 03:52:51.399 align:start position:0%
cars you could park within the 35 foot
 
03:52:52.670 --> 03:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
front yard
 
03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
setback then uh houses with longer
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
driveways were found to be able to park
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
more than that so they limited that
 
03:53:00.750 --> 03:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
there's no more than three or four cars
 
03:53:03.229 --> 03:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
the whole thing the whole
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
driveway then people had garages so they
 
03:53:08.149 --> 03:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
could park more than three cars in the
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
driveway and the garage so they said
 
03:53:11.550 --> 03:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
across the board no more than three cars
 
03:53:20.590 --> 03:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:24.309 --> 03:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
cars so for example on this car issue uh
 
03:53:25.630 --> 03:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
if you were a student living in a
 
03:53:28.189 --> 03:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom house with no more than uh
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh sorry with two other roommates that
 
03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
all Park their cars at your house if you
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
have a boyfriend or girlfriend that
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
wants to stay at their house a few
 
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
nights a week and park their car there
 
03:53:36.990 --> 03:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
it isn't allowed because that would
 
03:53:39.309 --> 03:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
appear to look like a fourth un related
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
property now if you hear the things that
 
03:53:48.910 --> 03:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
I've said and maybe you're confused over
 
03:53:51.189 --> 03:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
the last five minutes what is this guy
 
03:53:52.830 --> 03:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
talk talking about maybe he's not
 
03:53:55.469 --> 03:53:55.479 align:start position:0%
interpretating the zoning correctly what
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
the heck is he even talking about just
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
know that these are not my
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
interpretations they're the ones of the
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
town of
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
Durham and it is what they enforce and
 
03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
the courts have backed them up as I can
 
03:54:06.880 --> 03:54:07.870 align:start position:0%
the courts have backed them up as I can
attest

03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
attest
 
03:54:10.710 --> 03:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
to we are also confused and bewildered
 
03:54:12.070 --> 03:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
at the whole situation the lengths at
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
which the town goes to enforce this um
 
03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:16.750 align:start position:0%
which the town goes to enforce this um
to

03:54:16.750 --> 03:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
end I'd like to quote another person in
 
03:54:19.439 --> 03:54:23.269 align:start position:0%
end I'd like to quote another person in
town

03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
um that they acknowledge that what's
 
03:54:29.229 --> 03:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
Central to this issue is the housing
 
03:54:32.910 --> 03:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
Supply um and they admit that there is a
 
03:54:38.189 --> 03:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
supply and that um the university has
 
03:54:40.309 --> 03:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
decided to Force some people the
 
03:54:41.790 --> 03:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
underclassmen to live on campus and
 
03:54:43.389 --> 03:54:43.399 align:start position:0%
though that is true and that helps out
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
with it all the up all the upper
 
03:54:46.229 --> 03:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
classmen that were going to live on
 
03:54:48.630 --> 03:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
campus are now forced to live off so the
 
03:54:51.870 --> 03:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
issue of the housing Supply is the main
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
part of this and simply put if we sign
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and if we enact this bill it
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
will immediately add back in housing
 
03:55:02.910 --> 03:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
Supply units today with no construction
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
back into the dur market and that we all
 
03:55:05.439 --> 03:55:06.309 align:start position:0%
back into the dur market and that we all
can

03:55:06.309 --> 03:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:55:09.750 --> 03:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
agree will push rents down thank

03:55:36.149 --> 03:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
and there's three bedrooms and uh
 
03:55:39.990 --> 03:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
um is it your understanding that the
 
03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
regulations um would
 
03:55:52.750 --> 03:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
not allow you to rent to um two
 
03:55:57.550 --> 03:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
unmarried couples so if or is it is it
 
03:56:00.429 --> 03:56:00.439 align:start position:0%
that you if the girlfriend or boyfriend
 
03:56:03.389 --> 03:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
was staying over um but you didn't have
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
a contract with them to live there that
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
that would be allowed you can only have
 
03:56:12.030 --> 03:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
like leases with these many unrelated
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
couples or they literally if you had uh
 
03:56:20.309 --> 03:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
rented a room to two un unrelated people
 
03:56:21.670 --> 03:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then their girlfriend started to
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
live with them uh that would put you out
 
03:56:25.469 --> 03:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
of compliance even though you had
 
03:56:27.990 --> 03:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
nothing you had no contract with those
 
03:56:31.790 --> 03:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
those uh uh relationship that that is
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
kind of like spouse is
 
03:56:39.070 --> 03:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
person so absolutely to unrelated ated
 
03:56:41.469 --> 03:56:41.479 align:start position:0%
couples would be for unrelated people if
 
03:56:44.030 --> 03:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
they weren't married and that would not
 
03:56:47.469 --> 03:56:47.479 align:start position:0%
be allowed
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
um the situation that the the example
 
03:56:52.510 --> 03:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
that you just gave of a boyfriend you
 
03:56:53.870 --> 03:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
know spending or a girlfriend spending
 
03:56:55.550 --> 03:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
too much time at the house is a great
 
03:56:58.229 --> 03:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
example because if I only sign a lease
 
03:57:00.870 --> 03:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
to three people the Town Administrator
 
03:57:03.269 --> 03:57:03.279 align:start position:0%
the town code enforcer doesn't care
 
03:57:06.710 --> 03:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
really if it looks like there's more
 
03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
than three unrelated people living there
 
03:57:08.720 --> 03:57:09.429 align:start position:0%
than three unrelated people living there
whether

03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:57:12.189 --> 03:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
it's cars that are registered to four
 
03:57:13.349 --> 03:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
different families throughout the
 
03:57:16.950 --> 03:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
country or if they have
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
a town code enforcement officer sit
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
outside your property and start trying
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
to determine who's related and who's not
 
03:57:27.950 --> 03:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
they will pressure you and bring you to
 
03:57:31.750 --> 03:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
court over the matter to figure it out
 
03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
so that's how that
 
03:57:36.510 --> 03:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
works representative
 
03:57:39.030 --> 03:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
Holland so full disclosure I'm from
 
03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
Durham I represent Durham and I was on
 
03:57:45.790 --> 03:57:45.800 align:start position:0%
the Durham Town Council for 2016 to 2022
 
03:57:48.189 --> 03:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
and have been part of the zoning that
 
03:57:53.790 --> 03:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
has caused this um so I uh the reason
 
03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
for the enactment and I'll get to the
 
03:57:58.269 --> 03:57:58.279 align:start position:0%
question pretty quickly was uh nuisance
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
houses uh undergraduate houses
 
03:58:01.990 --> 03:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
particularly in neighborhoods caused a
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
lot of problem and uh so my question to
 
03:58:07.309 --> 03:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
you would be uh especially because you
 
03:58:10.149 --> 03:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned the case uh would you be open
 
03:58:12.309 --> 03:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
to saying that we would still allow the
 
03:58:14.429 --> 03:58:14.439 align:start position:0%
three unrelated but we would wave it in
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
the case of one of the units was owner
 
03:58:18.469 --> 03:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
occupied because again the owner
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
occupied in the unit would then help
 
03:58:22.149 --> 03:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
with the reason that we did the three
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
unrelated which was the nuisance
 
03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
requirement or the nuisance problem
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
sorry rep representative are you asking
 
03:58:31.269 --> 03:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
if I've been in favor of that or not in
 
03:58:33.710 --> 03:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
favor yeah would you I would I would not
 
03:58:36.870 --> 03:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:39.710 --> 03:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
favor for the question actually to to go
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
further than that no sir no we don't go
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
back and forth everything comes through
 
03:58:45.870 --> 03:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
the chair representative Brown
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
apologies okay so I'm I'm just trying to
 
03:58:49.830 --> 03:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
get a comparison between what what's
 
03:58:51.550 --> 03:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do with the law and what the
 
03:58:55.110 --> 03:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
existing law allows you to do in a
 
03:58:57.550 --> 03:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
maximum way so regardless of whether
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're related or not related you've
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
got a three-bedroom home with an
 
03:59:03.269 --> 03:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
accessory drill
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
dwelling if they're related how many
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
people can you put in that home as many
 
03:59:13.469 --> 03:59:13.479 align:start position:0%
as the house can accept per how it was
 
03:59:13.479 --> 03:59:14.750 align:start position:0%
as the house can accept per how it was
built

03:59:14.750 --> 03:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
built
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
for bedrooms and septics and follow up
 
03:59:20.550 --> 03:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman follow up
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
so as representative power said
 
03:59:25.389 --> 03:59:25.399 align:start position:0%
typically homes are designed for two
 
03:59:27.630 --> 03:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
occupants per bedroom so in your case it
 
03:59:31.229 --> 03:59:31.239 align:start position:0%
would be six plus the ex accessory
 
03:59:34.590 --> 03:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
dwelling so possibly eight is that
 
03:59:37.469 --> 03:59:37.479 align:start position:0%
correct would you assume that I I would
 
03:59:38.740 --> 03:59:38.750 align:start position:0%
assume that yes now
 
03:59:38.750 --> 03:59:40.590 align:start position:0%
assume that yes now
[Music]

03:59:40.590 --> 03:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:59:43.349 --> 03:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
um all the examples that I've given and
 
03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
the only reason why this came up um
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually had nothing to do with double
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
occupied bedrooms double occupied
 
03:59:50.750 --> 03:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
bedrooms are actually a fad that's going
 
03:59:53.070 --> 03:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
away um to answer your question I think
 
03:59:55.269 --> 03:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
from a while ago it was just to have a
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable cap on it so that there
 
04:00:00.269 --> 04:00:00.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't a I only care about single alopi
 
04:00:02.910 --> 04:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
ver in fact this build really was
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
intended only for that but we wanted to
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
put a cap on that so that there was some
 
04:00:09.990 --> 04:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
reasonableness to it
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any
 
04:00:15.229 --> 04:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Brown you
 
04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
can ask oh sorry representative you
 
04:00:18.269 --> 04:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
Keller we'll get back to you
 
04:00:20.429 --> 04:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
representative you had one more yes
 
04:00:24.070 --> 04:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um so it has nothing to do
 
04:00:27.149 --> 04:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
with Max maximum occupancy of a facil of
 
04:00:28.910 --> 04:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
a building
 
04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
right it has to do with from a technical
 
04:00:34.189 --> 04:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
standpoint yes correct thank you yeah
 
04:00:34.199 --> 04:00:35.229 align:start position:0%
standpoint yes correct thank you yeah
representative

04:00:35.229 --> 04:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
yell thank you um thank you for taking
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
another question
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
um kind of going back to my previous
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
question about um whether or not um we
 
04:00:52.710 --> 04:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
should have uh any we we as a state
 
04:00:54.870 --> 04:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
should allow any discrimination based on
 
04:00:57.710 --> 04:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
familial status or
 
04:01:02.550 --> 04:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
if um do you believe that that this uh
 
04:01:06.030 --> 04:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
allowance for two occupants per bedroom
 
04:01:08.670 --> 04:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
um based on familial status is okay or
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
do you think or would you support um uh
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
the state barring all uh familial status
 
04:01:20.229 --> 04:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
discrimination and just rely on
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
occupancy load
 
04:01:25.950 --> 04:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
essentially I think I understand that
 
04:01:25.960 --> 04:01:27.950 align:start position:0%
essentially I think I understand that
question

04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't particularly have a
 
04:01:32.429 --> 04:01:32.439 align:start position:0%
preference on that because my motivation
 
04:01:33.950 --> 04:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
from the beginning was just to be
 
04:01:36.429 --> 04:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
allowed if I had a fourth bedroom and a
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
three bed and I could only rent a three
 
04:01:42.349 --> 04:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
I just wanted the the person that is
 
04:01:44.349 --> 04:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
willing to rent that single occupied
 
04:01:46.830 --> 04:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
bedroom to be able to do it that's it
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative stavis thank you Mr chair
 
04:01:52.389 --> 04:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
um this is a procedural question mainly
 
04:01:55.910 --> 04:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
for you Mr chair which is um wondering
 
04:01:58.149 --> 04:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
when we're asking questions of people
 
04:02:01.030 --> 04:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
who are testifying if we could avoid
 
04:02:03.389 --> 04:02:03.399 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals uh and instead just ask
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
factual questions about the bill at hand
 
04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
I think that's an excellent point are
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
there any further questions for
 
04:02:15.429 --> 04:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
this uh before you leave I have two sure
 
04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
or maybe one um you mentioned the the
 
04:02:20.710 --> 04:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
very first property you bought in
 
04:02:24.269 --> 04:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
durm is am I correct that you found out
 
04:02:26.389 --> 04:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
about the zoning regulations after you
 
04:02:26.399 --> 04:02:29.830 align:start position:0%
about the zoning regulations after you
purchased

04:02:29.830 --> 04:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.429 --> 04:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
it from what I recall it's it's yeah I
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
was I was made aware I should have been
 
04:02:38.590 --> 04:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
made aware by my real estate agent at
 
04:02:40.990 --> 04:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
the time but I I was not it was post it
 
04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
was post okay did I also understand that
 
04:02:47.149 --> 04:02:47.159 align:start position:0%

04:02:49.550 --> 04:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
regulations you bought additional
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
properties in the same town correct
 
04:02:52.880 --> 04:02:53.710 align:start position:0%

04:02:59.309 --> 04:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your testimony
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Reed you are
 
04:03:03.120 --> 04:03:07.070 align:start position:0%
representative Reed you are
up

04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.080 --> 04:03:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
prioritized

04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
prioritized
 
04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you members
 
04:03:14.750 --> 04:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I am a co-sponsor and am in support
 
04:03:16.590 --> 04:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill for the record my name is
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 10
 
04:03:21.070 --> 04:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
which is New Market in newfields just
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
really quickly while I know there's a
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion around Durham my
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
neighboring Community um and I I got my
 
04:03:30.070 --> 04:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
masters at
 
04:03:33.429 --> 04:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
UNH um and and student housing and those
 
04:03:37.309 --> 04:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
issues I want to kind of get back to the
 
04:03:40.510 --> 04:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
general or origin of ordinances like
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
this one and it's not unique to New
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and those Origins are actually
 
04:03:51.189 --> 04:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
kind of moral Authority religious based
 
04:03:54.149 --> 04:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
um as in we don't want two unmarried
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
people in the same bedroom and I can
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
speak to that directly because when I
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
was a college student um I looked for an
 
04:04:03.790 --> 04:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
apartment with my now husband but then
 
04:04:06.269 --> 04:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
boyfriend we were about to sign the
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
papers we had looked at the place met
 
04:04:09.710 --> 04:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
the land lady everything was great and
 
04:04:10.990 --> 04:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
then she asked how long we had been
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
married and we told her we weren't
 
04:04:16.030 --> 04:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
married and she immediately withdrew her
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
offer to rent to us claiming and I am
 
04:04:22.269 --> 04:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
quoting that we would be living in sin
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
so um I don't think that that is the
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
role and I'll actually speak more to
 
04:04:29.590 --> 04:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
this on a different bill of
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities to kind of morally um
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
restrict what people should be doing
 
04:04:37.070 --> 04:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard all the reasons and we know
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
that we're in a major major housing
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
crisis and this is an easy way to
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
slightly alleviate that the issue that
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
got brought up is kind of Durham and the
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
um I guess the noise ordinance
 
04:04:53.469 --> 04:04:53.479 align:start position:0%
violations or what have you that might
 
04:04:55.790 --> 04:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
exist in a college Community I will say
 
04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
that when people buy property in a
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
college Community they do know that they
 
04:05:00.550 --> 04:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
are buying property in a college
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
Community also when you have uh noise
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
ordinance violations or other such
 
04:05:09.469 --> 04:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
violations of kind of public behavior um
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's the job of the municipality to
 
04:05:13.950 --> 04:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
enforce those ordinances not to kind of
 
04:05:16.630 --> 04:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
preemptively just in case these crazy
 
04:05:19.870 --> 04:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
kids get out of hand um restrict their
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
ability to live so having said that I
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can offer a lot of
 
04:05:25.950 --> 04:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
technical assistance on the bill but I'm
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer any questions
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
04:05:33.229 --> 04:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
testimony uh besides the moral issue can
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
you tell me why towns Zone in this
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
manner I think you
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
heard a bit about um student housing and
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh the ordinances or the the the
 
04:05:54.189 --> 04:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
noisiness of students or the perceived
 
04:05:56.110 --> 04:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
noisiness of who might be students in
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
white towns would try to do that but um
 
04:06:02.349 --> 04:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
as was stated if the house can safely
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
and technically house a certain number
 
04:06:05.790 --> 04:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
of people I don't think we have any
 
04:06:07.990 --> 04:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
business restricting that just because
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
we think somebody young might be a
 
04:06:13.510 --> 04:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
troublemaker or whatever a follow up Mr
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up isn't it possible
 
04:06:19.870 --> 04:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
that uh because of this bill you might
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
have those kind of situations but you
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
could end up with it slums in some
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods like a
 
04:06:29.950 --> 04:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
condo I don't believe any more likely
 
04:06:33.550 --> 04:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
than having uh six people who are
 
04:06:37.429 --> 04:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
related in the same structure um again
 
04:06:39.630 --> 04:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
we're bringing a lot of presuppositions
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
to who is moving in um it's it's kind of
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
silly it's the the idea that we can't
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
allow two people to be in the same
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
bedroom um who aren't already related is
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
is kind of silly especially in this
 
04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
housing market and to say that they're
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know neru Wells um is really
 
04:06:59.910 --> 04:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
prejudicial follow up Mr chair just
 
04:07:02.110 --> 04:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
quickly would you st representative
 
04:07:03.990 --> 04:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
Guthrie hold on we've got somebody else
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
who wants to speak I generally allow two
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
one followup your question so we'll come
 
04:07:10.830 --> 04:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
back to you representative kahill okay
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um it's my
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
04:07:20.349 --> 04:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities um hire like say their
 
04:07:22.349 --> 04:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
number of law enforcement based on
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
population and things like that do you
 
04:07:26.189 --> 04:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
do you think that suddenly changing the
 
04:07:28.269 --> 04:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
ordinance and
 
04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
increasing the potential population of s
 
04:07:33.630 --> 04:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
Durham do you think that that might
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
cause an increased need for more cost
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
for the town by having to more law
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement so overall I would say no
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that there will be a
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
population explosion in the town of
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
Durham in particular and by the way for
 
04:07:50.109 --> 04:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
full not only did I go to UNH and get my
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
masters there and I'm familiar um with
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
the situation I actually drove for
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
public transit all through dorham so
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
when people are talking about the
 
04:07:59.710 --> 04:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
Cottages I know these places extremely
 
04:08:03.790 --> 04:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
personally very well um the idea that if
 
04:08:05.189 --> 04:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
they're college students they're going
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
to be bad people and we're going to have
 
04:08:09.870 --> 04:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
to enforce it like I said I think that's
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
extremely prejudicial but in the case
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
where maybe there are increases of
 
04:08:16.349 --> 04:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
incidents it's actually UNH has their
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
own police force to deal with
 
04:08:22.349 --> 04:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
that further questions representative
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:27.990 --> 04:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
more it was time sensitive Mr chairman
 
04:08:30.590 --> 04:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you okay very good all right see
 
04:08:32.830 --> 04:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
no more questions thank you very
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
testimony uh next up we have Ben Frost
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
who said to minute so we're going to
 
04:08:41.309 --> 04:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
hold you to that Mr
 
04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%

I'm the deputy executive director and
 
04:08:52.990 --> 04:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
chief legal officer at New Hampshire
 
04:08:55.149 --> 04:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
housing I'm here to speak in favor of
 
04:08:57.109 --> 04:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1281 and I want to thank
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative power for introducing
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
this important
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislation uh what What's not apparent
 
04:09:07.790 --> 04:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
in this bill is the implications of
 
04:09:07.800 --> 04:09:09.510 align:start position:0%
in this bill is the implications of
federal

04:09:09.510 --> 04:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:09:11.910 --> 04:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
law the US Department of Housing and
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
Urban Development has standards
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
for uh landlord action that have
 
04:09:21.510 --> 04:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
implications for municipalities as well
 
04:09:22.710 --> 04:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
04:09:26.109 --> 04:09:26.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh there's law uh that dates
 
04:09:28.030 --> 04:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
back actually to
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
1991 and this is a memo from the HUD
 
04:09:33.630 --> 04:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
office of general counsel written by a
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
man by the name of Frank keading and it
 
04:09:40.429 --> 04:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
establishes Hud's understanding of what
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
the um uh appropriate role is of
 
04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
limiting the number of people per
 
04:09:49.710 --> 04:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
bedroom and it is
 
04:09:53.070 --> 04:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
a uh multiactor analysis as you would
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
anticipate from federal law uh that is
 
04:09:57.389 --> 04:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
interpret uh but basically what it says
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
to landlords and by extension also to
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities in adopting
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
regulations because you have to be
 
04:10:11.070 --> 04:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
careful and thoughtful about adopting
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
maximum occupancy per bedroom
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
standards what this bill does is
 
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
establishes a baseline for
 
04:10:21.070 --> 04:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities in New Hampshire that is
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal law there's
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
further analysis that should be done if
 
04:10:29.670 --> 04:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
a municipality is considering limiting
 
04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
occupancy per bedroom uh but this
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
establishes an important Baseline that
 
04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
brings Municipal action in line with
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
04:10:43.389 --> 04:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
um there there are a number of issues
 
04:10:45.550 --> 04:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
that have been raised parking and and
 
04:10:47.149 --> 04:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
and I agree that those can be addressed
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
and should be addressed through other
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
regulations septics septic systems are
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
based on Department of Environmental
 
04:10:57.309 --> 04:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
Services standards based on bedrooms not
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
how many people occupy a structure but
 
04:11:01.950 --> 04:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
on the number of bedrooms in a structure
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
you might have a three-bedroom house
 
04:11:06.109 --> 04:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
with one person you might have a a
 
04:11:08.830 --> 04:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
six-bedroom house with 12 people the
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
septic system is designed to accommodate
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
the flow coming from the bedrooms based
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
upon what de's understanding is of the
 
04:11:20.550 --> 04:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
use of a structure and it's not based on
 
04:11:22.590 --> 04:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh the number of people
 
04:11:26.189 --> 04:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
there um I'll F note finally um the
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
question of marital status is a
 
04:11:33.389 --> 04:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
protected class under New Hampshire law
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
so whether someone is married or not is
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
of no conc concern to a municipality in
 
04:11:39.720 --> 04:11:41.510 align:start position:0%
of no conc concern to a municipality in
its

04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
its
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
regulations and is potentially a
 
04:11:46.269 --> 04:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
violation of New Hampshire law for a
 
04:11:49.229 --> 04:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
municipality to be so regulating it I
 
04:11:51.550 --> 04:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
would make one recommendation on this
 
04:11:53.309 --> 04:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
legislation and this gets to
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
representative y's earlier question on
 
04:11:58.950 --> 04:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
lines eight and nine of the
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
bill there's language here that I think
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily limits the application of
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
the law if of this this legislation
 
04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
where it says based upon the existence
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
of unrelated or non-familiar
 
04:12:14.750 --> 04:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
relationships between occupants of such
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
rental property I believe that you can
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
strike that language and make this bill
 
04:12:18.960 --> 04:12:20.269 align:start position:0%
strike that language and make this bill
even

04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
stronger municipalities should not be in
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
the business of limiting people per
 
04:12:28.349 --> 04:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
bedroom in a way that is inconsistent
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
with federal
 
04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
law and this would achieve that I'd be
 
04:12:34.750 --> 04:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
04:12:34.760 --> 04:12:36.229 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
for

04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:12:40.030 --> 04:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
Testimony representative yella thank you
 
04:12:42.910 --> 04:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
04:12:45.950 --> 04:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
um it seemed in your testimony that you
 
04:12:49.710 --> 04:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
that you uh stated that uh familial
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
status um is a protected class um in New
 
04:12:54.359 --> 04:12:55.950 align:start position:0%
status um is a protected class um in New
Hampshire

04:12:55.950 --> 04:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
and that uh this legislation seems to
 
04:13:04.750 --> 04:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
allow some discrimination based on
 
04:13:08.590 --> 04:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
familial status um by municipalities
 
04:13:11.670 --> 04:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
essentially um contradicting that
 
04:13:14.670 --> 04:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
restriction based on uh discrimination
 
04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
based on fonal status on on line eight
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
and nine where it says they can't do uh
 
04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
less than two per bedroom so it seems
 
04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
like they are allowed to do some
 
04:13:26.670 --> 04:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination but you just said that
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh contrary to New Hampshire
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
law to be able to discriminate on
 
04:13:33.750 --> 04:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
familial status so can you uh square
 
04:13:37.349 --> 04:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
that Circle for me see if let me am am I
 
04:13:38.750 --> 04:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
reading that
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
incorrectly I think he in his last
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
statement he addressed that
 
04:13:46.590 --> 04:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
specifically his recommendation would be
 
04:13:46.600 --> 04:13:48.309 align:start position:0%
specifically his recommendation would be
to

04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate line the the language on eight
 
04:13:52.750 --> 04:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
and nine so I think that speaks exactly
 
04:13:55.750 --> 04:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
to which you're asking was that his I
 
04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
didn't understand that that his his
 
04:14:00.189 --> 04:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
suggestion was to strike that whole
 
04:14:02.469 --> 04:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
representative stavis it is thank you Mr
 
04:14:03.870 --> 04:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
question Mr Frost um you've introduced
 
04:14:10.030 --> 04:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh marital status into the conversation
 
04:14:12.750 --> 04:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
here I don't see that in this bill um
 
04:14:14.389 --> 04:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm just not looking closely
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
enough but I see familial
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
relationships I do not believe that
 
04:14:22.030 --> 04:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
familial relationships are protected
 
04:14:24.790 --> 04:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
class so I'm wondering
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
where what is the basis for your
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
statement about marital status versus
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill which is familiar
 
04:14:36.309 --> 04:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
relationships representative sis A
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
Familiar relation relationships are a
 
04:14:39.790 --> 04:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
protected class and and that is the
 
04:14:43.469 --> 04:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
basis for uh our laws against
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:50.830 --> 04:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
children further question representative
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you for letting me get on
 
04:14:58.469 --> 04:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman uh what my concern is
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
that is that you got to have some kind
 
04:15:00.560 --> 04:15:01.349 align:start position:0%
that is that you got to have some kind
of

04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
zoning if we didn't you imply that the
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
number of bedrooms did not impa act on
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
the septic system and it was unfair to
 
04:15:13.109 --> 04:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
use them if if I read you right if
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's the case how about us using
 
04:15:14.880 --> 04:15:16.550 align:start position:0%
that's the case how about us using
bathrooms

04:15:16.550 --> 04:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
bathrooms
 
04:15:19.109 --> 04:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
instead as a matter of zoning
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
representative my my statement was that
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
um septic systems are designed based
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
upon the number of bedrooms what happens
 
04:15:29.109 --> 04:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
if we use bathrooms instead is that a
 
04:15:31.870 --> 04:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
better way we're getting off off to the
 
04:15:33.870 --> 04:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
Weeds on that one that's bathrooms
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
versus bedrooms is not Rel to the
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
current bill I have to have some kind of
 
04:15:42.070 --> 04:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
zoning Mr chairman thank you well that's
 
04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
up to the zone at your town
 
04:15:45.950 --> 04:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative priest and thank you for
 
04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question and welcome Mr Frost
 
04:15:51.030 --> 04:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
municipal again I go back to the issue
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
of parking since
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
I uh was an urban planner for 45 years
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I have seen residential
 
04:16:03.600 --> 04:16:05.349 align:start position:0%
and I have seen residential
houses

04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
houses
 
04:16:09.149 --> 04:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
um turn into to rental properties for
 
04:16:13.149 --> 04:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
unlimited number of unrelated
 
04:16:16.349 --> 04:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
people and I'm also aware of the housing
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
crisis that we are in and young people
 
04:16:21.349 --> 04:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
who are having
 
04:16:25.149 --> 04:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
to to share bedrooms and to live like
 
04:16:27.870 --> 04:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
this because there's no housing
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
available I I get it um what I don't get
 
04:16:37.349 --> 04:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
is how can we police the parking if a
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
house is in a residential single family
 
04:16:42.030 --> 04:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
residential commun
 
04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
neighborhood how can we police it to
 
04:16:47.309 --> 04:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are not
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
impacting the rest of the
 
04:16:53.109 --> 04:16:53.119 align:start position:0%
community thank you for that thoughtful
 
04:16:56.590 --> 04:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
question representative PRI I I think my
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
my answer to your question is um well
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
has a couple of different aspects one uh
 
04:17:07.469 --> 04:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
it's not really material whether
 
04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
people are related uh as to the number
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
of vehicles and I think we can dispense
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
with that I know in my town there are
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
houses with many registered vehicles uh
 
04:17:21.229 --> 04:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
parked in a yard uh and their single
 
04:17:21.239 --> 04:17:22.149 align:start position:0%
parked in a yard uh and their single
family

04:17:22.149 --> 04:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:17:26.070 --> 04:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
homes um I think the qu the the my best
 
04:17:28.389 --> 04:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is if you want
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
to regulate parking then regulate
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
parking and municipalities have the
 
04:17:37.469 --> 04:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
authority to do so
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't do it by regulating the number of
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
people occupying a
 
04:17:45.790 --> 04:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
bedroom it's good uh quick followup
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative uh so what you're
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that the communities um
 
04:17:54.750 --> 04:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
say two parking spaces per
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
bedroom if if this bill was
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
passed we're
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
gonna no no more on the parking this one
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't speci unfortunately doesn't
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
specifically address that representative
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
further questions for represent uh for
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%

04:18:34.269 --> 04:18:34.279 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
04:18:36.910 --> 04:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
um the I have many of the same same
 
04:18:38.469 --> 04:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
experiences but I'll just give my own
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
personal just to keep it quick the code
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer watches my
 
04:18:44.950 --> 04:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
properties very closely Audrey Klein and
 
04:18:46.830 --> 04:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
her employees sit in their code
 
04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement Vehicles outside my
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
properties every day they monitor every
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
vehicle that goes onto any one of my
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
properties they run the license plates
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
through the DMV figure out who owns each
 
04:19:00.550 --> 04:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle whether it's a moped a
 
04:19:03.149 --> 04:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
motorcycle a car anything with a license
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
plate um and this way they know anybody
 
04:19:08.070 --> 04:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's at my properties at any time of
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
any day and this happens seven days a
 
04:19:13.389 --> 04:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
week my properties are also inspected
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
four times per year during these
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
inspections Audrey counts the
 
04:19:19.229 --> 04:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
toothbrushes in every bathroom to make
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
sure there's no more than three she
 
04:19:22.990 --> 04:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
takes pictures of the shoes in every
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
bedroom to verify that they're all the
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
same size she goes through any mail that
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
she sees to make sure all the mail is
 
04:19:32.030 --> 04:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
addressed to the tenants that live there
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
if there's a piece of mail from a
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
previous tenant that means there's more
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
than three people
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
on every inspection she tells me that I
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
should block off certain bedrooms so
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
that no one is quote tempted to live in
 
04:19:46.950 --> 04:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
them every so often Audrey and the fire
 
04:19:49.469 --> 04:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
inspector Brendan OS Sullivan will
 
04:19:51.109 --> 04:19:51.119 align:start position:0%
trespass onto the properties knock on
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
the door and tell the tenant who answers
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
that he or she has no choice but to let
 
04:19:57.070 --> 04:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
them inspect the property they typically
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
typically claim there's life safety
 
04:20:00.870 --> 04:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
issues that they need to check on and if
 
04:20:02.349 --> 04:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
the tenant says no Then they threaten
 
04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
them with lawsuits and
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
fines they relish any opportunity to
 
04:20:08.830 --> 04:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
tell my tenants how much control they
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
have over them Brendan has directly
 
04:20:13.309 --> 04:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
called and text messaged some of my
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
tenants on numerous occasions to tell
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
them that he wants to inspect their
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
house without the landlord's
 
04:20:20.750 --> 04:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge you're probably thinking that
 
04:20:22.269 --> 04:20:22.279 align:start position:0%
I must have a whole lot of tenants and
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
durm for the town to devote this much
 
04:20:28.149 --> 04:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
time effort and taxpayer money to spying
 
04:20:31.109 --> 04:20:31.119 align:start position:0%
on them in reality I have five single
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
family homes that they focus on these
 
04:20:35.710 --> 04:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
five properties have 22 bedrooms and
 
04:20:39.149 --> 04:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
house a total of 15 people so a third of
 
04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
my bedrooms are
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
vacant um While most cities and towns in
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
the area are finding the best way to
 
04:20:45.750 --> 04:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
increase the number of available
 
04:20:47.710 --> 04:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
bedrooms Durham continues to
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
deliberately limit its
 
04:20:51.550 --> 04:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
Supply doesn't make a lot of sense in a
 
04:20:53.710 --> 04:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
time where there's an ongoing housing
 
04:20:56.229 --> 04:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
shortage three bed three people in a
 
04:20:58.510 --> 04:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
five-bedroom house totally defies logic
 
04:21:01.389 --> 04:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
and Common Sense most people that I've
 
04:21:05.790 --> 04:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
talked to think that uh hb281 would
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
positively affect renters and Durham in
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
ways I'm in agreement and I know my
 
04:21:12.750 --> 04:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
tenants would love the opportunity to
 
04:21:14.030 --> 04:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
not have to live in fear of an
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
overbearing Town Administration that has
 
04:21:18.990 --> 04:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
such a disdain for college students when
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
they live in a college
 
04:21:23.229 --> 04:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
town um thanks for
 
04:21:26.670 --> 04:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
listening thank you questions represent
 
04:21:28.750 --> 04:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
K thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you think that
 
04:21:37.870 --> 04:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
um UNH financially gains by being the
 
04:21:40.030 --> 04:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
sole renter to the students by having
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
these ordinances in place in durh does
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
UNH gain
 
04:21:47.469 --> 04:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
yeah um I think it's there's the same
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
amount of students regardless this is a
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is private property not un quick
 
04:21:52.000 --> 04:21:54.030 align:start position:0%
this is private property not un quick
followup

04:21:54.030 --> 04:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
followup
 
04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
yet well what I mean is if they limit
 
04:22:01.349 --> 04:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
your ability to rent to students by
 
04:22:04.189 --> 04:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
making a third of your bedrooms unusable
 
04:22:06.630 --> 04:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
through ordinance and then they are now
 
04:22:08.309 --> 04:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
renting to the students who live on
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
campus I think their dorms are filled
 
04:22:12.670 --> 04:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
already and this is just the excess
 
04:22:15.630 --> 04:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
people who can't live in the dorms or
 
04:22:18.189 --> 04:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
don't or don't want to and so there's
 
04:22:20.189 --> 04:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
just the same amount of the same pool of
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
people are looking for housing and
 
04:22:23.469 --> 04:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
they're just limiting how many people
 
04:22:25.950 --> 04:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
can live in each property so it
 
04:22:28.349 --> 04:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
basically creates a situation where
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
where you could have you know 10 people
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
living in three homes now 10 people can
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
live in fewer
 
04:22:35.359 --> 04:22:40.670 align:start position:0%
live in fewer
homes

04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:43.469 --> 04:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:55.030 --> 04:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:59.389 --> 04:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:01.510 --> 04:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
minutes I promise to be shorter than
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
that and I apologize uh for my bad
 
04:23:06.030 --> 04:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
handwriting uh my name is Daniel du I'm
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
legal policy director at Pacific Legal
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
Foundation we are a nonprofit
 
04:23:14.189 --> 04:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
organization um focused on separation of
 
04:23:16.910 --> 04:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
powers um equality on opportunity and
 
04:23:19.950 --> 04:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
most pertinent to to this committee um
 
04:23:23.349 --> 04:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
property rights we um we've been around
 
04:23:25.750 --> 04:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
for about 50 years now we've had 17 wins
 
04:23:27.950 --> 04:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
at the US Supreme Court um we just
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
argued another case a couple weeks ago
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
and so we're very interested in this
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
issue we have a team that's dedicated at
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
um at housing issues because of the the
 
04:23:42.309 --> 04:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
housing crisis but looking at it through
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
a a property rights um
 
04:23:46.640 --> 04:23:48.469 align:start position:0%
a a property rights um
lens

04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
lens
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
so we actually have a a federal lawsuit
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
right now um over this exact issue um
 
04:23:56.990 --> 04:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's pending in Kansas the case is
 
04:23:59.469 --> 04:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
called Home Room V uh city of shaune the
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
city has an ordinance limiting unrelated
 
04:24:04.750 --> 04:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
occupants um just like this bill
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
contemplates it playes is
 
04:24:13.109 --> 04:24:13.119 align:start position:0%
um uh it it uh we are uh representing a
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
business that facilitates roommate
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
relationships we're also representing um
 
04:24:21.710 --> 04:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
a woman who um who out of the goodness
 
04:24:25.469 --> 04:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
of her heart was allowing her her son's
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh girlfriend fiance to live with them
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
and they were unable to do so because of
 
04:24:32.229 --> 04:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
of this ordinance we believe that these
 
04:24:34.389 --> 04:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
ordinances uh violate constitutional
 
04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
rights including the the right of
 
04:24:40.670 --> 04:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
Association um and also discriminating
 
04:24:43.349 --> 04:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
based off of familiar rights as uh or
 
04:24:46.750 --> 04:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
familiar familial relationships as was
 
04:24:51.030 --> 04:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
noted before um I'll just uh address a
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
couple of things that I think have have
 
04:24:54.590 --> 04:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
been noted there's concern about whether
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
this is an attack on single family
 
04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
zoning um I certainly don't think that
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
it is that um if somebody wants to build
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
an apartment building or a condominium
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
or something like that they still have
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
to get the permits to to build something
 
04:25:10.389 --> 04:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
like that so this does not open the
 
04:25:12.269 --> 04:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
floodgates for new building or
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
development or anything like this this
 
04:25:16.750 --> 04:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
is for existing structures um and I
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
promise to be brief so with that I'll
 
04:25:21.550 --> 04:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you very much
 
04:25:21.560 --> 04:25:22.990 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you very much
representative

04:25:22.990 --> 04:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
majori thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:25:28.469 --> 04:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um uh
 
04:25:30.109 --> 04:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully this is in bounds
 
04:25:31.750 --> 04:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
but you'll tell me if it's not I'm just
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
curious you said you your organization
 
04:25:36.189 --> 04:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
has represented before The Supreme Court
 
04:25:38.910 --> 04:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
before and I'm curious if if in that
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
experience you know whether or not the
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has generally accepted
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
that municipalities can restrict the
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
number of unrelated people living in a
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
rental property uh through the chair
 
04:25:51.389 --> 04:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative I think that there is
 
04:25:52.990 --> 04:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
there is one case we don't think that
 
04:25:55.950 --> 04:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
the appropriate um restrictions were or
 
04:25:58.349 --> 04:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
or the appropriate claims were raised in
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
that case but um the Supreme Court did
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
not uh strike down that ordinance in
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
that case we think that the Supreme
 
04:26:07.149 --> 04:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
Court it wrong and so we're trying to
 
04:26:09.070 --> 04:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
litigate these things back up as you
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
know the the Supreme Court uh will
 
04:26:15.229 --> 04:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
change precedent from from uh time again
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank for the question representative
 
04:26:20.590 --> 04:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
Guth again thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:26:22.630 --> 04:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony particularly with
 
04:26:27.109 --> 04:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
your background uh can you did you can
 
04:26:31.149 --> 04:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
you tell us how uh a community would
 
04:26:33.630 --> 04:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
protect the health and safety of people
 
04:26:37.469 --> 04:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
living in say a condominium other than
 
04:26:39.950 --> 04:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh some sort of zoning limiting the
 
04:26:44.349 --> 04:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
number of people in that uh structure uh
 
04:26:46.349 --> 04:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
through the chair representative uh this
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
does not to my understanding my reading
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill this do not a place a
 
04:26:54.389 --> 04:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
limitation on uh municipalities to put
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
limits on number total numbers of people
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
parking uh septic any any of those kind
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
of things it's it's basic it's it's only
 
04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
there to eliminate restrictions B based
 
04:27:08.070 --> 04:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
off of familial
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
relationships all right um thank you
 
04:27:13.149 --> 04:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I did if I may Mr
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
chairman I I I I misunderstood the bill
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
I thought it was more than that I
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
thought it was had an impact on zoning
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the number of people who who are
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
actually living in the structure thank
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
you further questions seeing none thank
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%

04:27:39.910 --> 04:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee for
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Alyssa margolin I
 
04:27:44.109 --> 04:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
serve as director of housing action New
 
04:27:46.149 --> 04:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we're a Statewide
 
04:27:49.590 --> 04:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
organization of 80 entities United to
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
improve state and federal policy so
 
04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
everyone in New Hampshire has a place to
 
04:27:54.990 --> 04:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
call home um we've worked with this
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
committee many times as you know um we
 
04:28:00.389 --> 04:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
have a housing crisis in New Hampshire
 
04:28:03.550 --> 04:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
and um it is probably it is it is the
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
number one issue uh of concern uh among
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and is probably
 
04:28:11.670 --> 04:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
the number one issue keeping our um
 
04:28:14.229 --> 04:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
economic growth um we certainly have
 
04:28:18.149 --> 04:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages as a result um and
 
04:28:21.469 --> 04:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
we have been partnering with um an
 
04:28:24.990 --> 04:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
academic partner um St anom College uh
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
Center for ethics and society and they
 
04:28:30.750 --> 04:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh took on um the New Hampshire zoning
 
04:28:34.590 --> 04:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
Atlas and uh did um us all a great
 
04:28:37.269 --> 04:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
service by presenting us with research
 
04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
on the zoning barriers that were keeping
 
04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
us from um developing the units that we
 
04:28:46.389 --> 04:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
need uh in order to address the housing
 
04:28:48.990 --> 04:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
crisis and um a lot of really important
 
04:28:52.590 --> 04:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
discussions have resulted um since the
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
release of the atlas and one of them is
 
04:28:57.550 --> 04:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
around reasonableness and so I ask the
 
04:28:59.229 --> 04:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
committee to consider that I think
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative power um has a a great
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
example for for you to consider when
 
04:29:08.670 --> 04:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
going outside of that health and safety
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
piece um and um and
 
04:29:17.309 --> 04:29:17.319 align:start position:0%
uh likely with um motivations around
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
health and safety um but um but uh but
 
04:29:22.560 --> 04:29:23.550 align:start position:0%
health and safety um but um but uh but
really

04:29:23.550 --> 04:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
creating um unfair zoning barriers that
 
04:29:30.189 --> 04:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
are keeping people from um enjoying the
 
04:29:32.189 --> 04:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
their own communities and being able to
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
to grow and prosper in their own
 
04:29:37.149 --> 04:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
backyards so we asked ask you uh to
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
consider the the balance of Interest
 
04:29:40.349 --> 04:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
here and we think this would be a good
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
example of a of a time and a place to uh
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
to tell a community that they they
 
04:29:47.149 --> 04:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have an ordinance in this
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
direction thank you and I'm happy to
 
04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%

04:29:53.389 --> 04:29:53.399 align:start position:0%

fifth generation farmer and no stranger
 
04:30:29.790 --> 04:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
to hard work my values are slightly
 
04:30:31.389 --> 04:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
different from my peers I don't
 
04:30:32.910 --> 04:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
participate in any of the partying
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
typically associated with the college
 
04:30:37.750 --> 04:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
experience I just work I'm I'm not one
 
04:30:39.590 --> 04:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the noise
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
makers I just completed my third fall
 
04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
semester with a 4.0 GPA working as a
 
04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
handyman and other odd jobs to stay busy
 
04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
between classes and returning to the
 
04:30:49.830 --> 04:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
farm each
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
weekend this type of busy lifestyle is
 
04:30:53.710 --> 04:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
the way I grew up and it makes me feel
 
04:30:55.990 --> 04:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
accomplished however to my surprise and
 
04:31:00.189 --> 04:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
maybe to yours uh despite how much time
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
I spend working it takes everything I
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
can muster to pay for basic expenses
 
04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
each month like Fuel and food
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
in Durham my fellow students and I have
 
04:31:10.149 --> 04:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
been subject to the exact Municipal
 
04:31:11.630 --> 04:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that today's bill will
 
04:31:14.349 --> 04:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
restrict my area of emphasis at UNH is
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
agricultural business I have taken
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
courses on economics and on real estate
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
it takes only a grasp of either to
 
04:31:22.269 --> 04:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
understand that when Supply a market
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
decreases price increases I'm here today
 
04:31:28.109 --> 04:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
to represent my peers in support in
 
04:31:31.229 --> 04:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 1281 which will
 
04:31:33.550 --> 04:31:33.560 align:start position:0%

1250 and that is
 
04:35:09.910 --> 04:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
enabling the creation of certain Village
 
04:35:12.429 --> 04:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
districts I see the prime sponsor
 
04:35:15.390 --> 04:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
representative wolf is sitting here

members of the municipal and County
 
04:35:31.949 --> 04:35:31.959 align:start position:0%
committee House Bill 1250 is a small
 
04:35:34.869 --> 04:35:34.879 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation but a very big one
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
for the the ability to protect and
 
04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
enhance the
 
04:35:41.590 --> 04:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
environment house build 1250 adds one
 
04:35:46.709 --> 04:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
additional purpose to the 14 that RSA 52
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
allows Municipal districts to have it is
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
the protection and Remediation of
 
04:35:55.869 --> 04:35:55.879 align:start position:0%
surface water quality within a
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%
district this bill allows for the
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
creation of one organization that has
 
04:36:03.629 --> 04:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
the authority to create and enforce
 
04:36:05.830 --> 04:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
rules that would protect protect water
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
bodies that exist in more than one
 
04:36:12.429 --> 04:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
municipality in our case we're talking
 
04:36:16.109 --> 04:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
about lake cipy that is four districts
 
04:36:16.119 --> 04:36:17.310 align:start position:0%
about lake cipy that is four districts
four

04:36:17.310 --> 04:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:36:20.230 --> 04:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
towns as the multiple towns within a
 
04:36:22.990 --> 04:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
district Watershed might have various
 
04:36:23.000 --> 04:36:24.390 align:start position:0%
district Watershed might have various
building

04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:36:27.551 --> 04:36:27.561 align:start position:0%
setbacks septic pumping rules erosion
 
04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
Control ordinances and especially
 
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
varying enforcement it is necessary to
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
have one authority to protect the common
 
04:36:38.910 --> 04:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
water body all of the water that is
 
04:36:41.551 --> 04:36:41.561 align:start position:0%
within the Watershed needs to be treated
 
04:36:45.029 --> 04:36:45.039 align:start position:0%
the same it all ends up in the same
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
place without a village District No
 
04:36:51.150 --> 04:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
singular entity has responsibility for
 
04:36:54.349 --> 04:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
water quality and Environmental
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
Protection passage of hb1 1250 would
 
04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
have the ability to one give a mandate
 
04:37:05.349 --> 04:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
to one legal entity to protect protect
 
04:37:05.359 --> 04:37:06.109 align:start position:0%
to one legal entity to protect protect
the

04:37:06.109 --> 04:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
Watershed provide consistent regulations
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
for the towns within the
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
Watershed provide consistent
 
04:37:16.349 --> 04:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
enforcements of the rules and
 
04:37:19.230 --> 04:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
regulations and number four offer the
 
04:37:21.551 --> 04:37:21.561 align:start position:0%
ability to have prevention and planning
 
04:37:22.830 --> 04:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:37:26.109 --> 04:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
future passage of this bill does not
 
04:37:29.310 --> 04:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
form the village District it only gives
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
the towns within the district the
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
ability to vote to establish such a
 
04:37:38.029 --> 04:37:38.039 align:start position:0%
District it is the first step but the
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
most necessary One to begin the
 
04:37:43.869 --> 04:37:43.879 align:start position:0%
formation of a village District the 12
 
04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
words that I referenced in my opening
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
statement could have a huge impact on
 
04:37:52.029 --> 04:37:52.039 align:start position:0%
the future of multiple water bodies
 
04:37:54.629 --> 04:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
within the state protection and
 
04:37:57.429 --> 04:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
Remediation of surface water quality
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
within the
 
04:38:01.990 --> 04:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
district this bill provides a framework
 
04:38:05.230 --> 04:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
for towns to prevent Cal bacteria to
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
main maintain Pure Clean drinking water
 
04:38:11.429 --> 04:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
and provide for the ability to have a
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
healthy Recreation and a clean
 
04:38:17.150 --> 04:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
environment I'll be happy to answer any

towns of a district if one were to be
 
04:38:47.629 --> 04:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
formed again this is enabling
 
04:38:49.830 --> 04:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
legislations the towns within the
 
04:38:52.150 --> 04:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
Watershed district will have to get

letting me speak uh I'm Hal krier I live
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
in Northwood New Hampshire I'm
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
here representing myself but I'm really
 
04:40:23.150 --> 04:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
speaking from the experience that I've
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
had as a select board member for five
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
years chair for four
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
years I've been on the board and the
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
chair for our local municip excuse me
 
04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
our local
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
local uh Watershed or Pond
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
Association uh so just recognize that
 
04:40:44.910 --> 04:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking from my experience not as a
 
04:40:47.788 --> 04:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
representative of those
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
organizations uh I think this bill is
 
04:40:52.270 --> 04:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
important really from three perspectives
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
and they add to what the sponsor uh
 
04:40:59.310 --> 04:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned um there's been a
 
04:41:02.590 --> 04:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
downshift in spending the federal
 
04:41:04.030 --> 04:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
government and the state government
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
aren't funding things for this type of
 
04:41:09.390 --> 04:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
stuff for the prevention and treatment
 
04:41:11.470 --> 04:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
of things like they used to it's harder
 
04:41:13.628 --> 04:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
to get grants there's less money
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
available uh we need more certainty in
 
04:41:19.910 --> 04:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
funding so we can take some of these
 
04:41:19.920 --> 04:41:21.030 align:start position:0%
funding so we can take some of these
initiatives

04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
04:41:24.670 --> 04:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
on and the taxpayers and the local folks
 
04:41:28.868 --> 04:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
want to see that it's a fair process so
 
04:41:30.390 --> 04:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
in in terms of dealing with the
 
04:41:33.190 --> 04:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
downshift in funding a lot of the things
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
like the lake host program are funded by
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
boat registration it's just not enough
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh on our association we spend 15 20 and
 
04:41:45.150 --> 04:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
some years
 
04:41:47.750 --> 04:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
$25,000 and we appreciate the money we
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
get from New Hampshire Lakes but it's
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
only like a couple thousand we have to
 
04:41:53.628 --> 04:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
raise the
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
rest uh this would give us the means to
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
do that and I will say that in Northwood
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
we have four Village districts and they
 
04:42:06.190 --> 04:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
work very well
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh they get consistency of funding and
 
04:42:11.230 --> 04:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
all that type of stuff that goes with it
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh and why is that important well when
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
you go to hire somebody for the for the
 
04:42:19.390 --> 04:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
lake host program it typically might be
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
a college student you'll talk to them in
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
January but you don't know if the town's
 
04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
going to vote for funds to help support
 
04:42:30.550 --> 04:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
that until March so they take another
 
04:42:34.510 --> 04:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
job if you want to treat for example the
 
04:42:37.550 --> 04:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
mil foil in in your water body you
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
actually need to get the permits 6
 
04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
months before you even know if the
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
funding is available and
 
04:42:46.030 --> 04:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
yes those folks around the lake will try
 
04:42:47.868 --> 04:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
to raise some of the money but like in
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
Northwood they depended on $112,000 a
 
04:42:53.070 --> 04:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
year from the town they wouldn't know if
 
04:42:55.550 --> 04:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
they were going to get that till March
 
04:42:58.110 --> 04:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
so that left them in this Catch 22 well
 
04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
we we need to get you know the permits
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
we need to apply for the you know all
 
04:43:07.230 --> 04:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
the treatment programs but we can't
 
04:43:09.070 --> 04:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
confirm that because we don't know if
 
04:43:10.590 --> 04:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
we'll get all the
 
04:43:13.390 --> 04:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
money so there's that certain certainty
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
of funding that would really help
 
04:43:17.910 --> 04:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
because you can depend on this much more
 
04:43:19.628 --> 04:43:19.638 align:start position:0%
and then the third part of it is the
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
fairness issue in Northwood we're
 
04:43:26.350 --> 04:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
fortunate the whole town supports the
 
04:43:30.270 --> 04:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
environmental considerations so the town
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
via two different warrant
 
04:43:35.230 --> 04:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
articles approves approximately 20 to
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
$225,000 a year now like I said with the
 
04:43:40.670 --> 04:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
jennis pond
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
Association that helps that that gives
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
us another $4,000 but as I said it costs
 
04:43:46.440 --> 04:43:47.708 align:start position:0%
us another $4,000 but as I said it costs
us

04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
20ish so again between the boat
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
registration that we get from Lake host
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh from excuse me Andrea and New
 
04:43:58.270 --> 04:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes and the town we're only
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
covering a third of the cost and so we
 
04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
try to raise it amongst all the other
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
folks around the the pond
 
04:44:08.708 --> 04:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
well not everybody contributes so
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
there's a fairness issue there and then
 
04:44:12.750 --> 04:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
you also got the fairness issue related
 
04:44:14.948 --> 04:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
to you got folks that aren't even on the
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
lake saying well why should I support
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
this you know when people around the
 
04:44:22.948 --> 04:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
lake aren't supporting it well as a
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
selectboard member I explained to them
 
04:44:24.718 --> 04:44:26.350 align:start position:0%
selectboard member I explained to them
that

04:44:26.350 --> 04:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:29.070 --> 04:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
well if the if the if the lake goes
 
04:44:32.150 --> 04:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
south and you lose 20% of your value
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
your assessed value is you know going to
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to cause an increasing your tax
 
04:44:37.350 --> 04:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
rate so they accept that and they do
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
support it but not to the extent that I
 
04:44:40.430 --> 04:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
think they
 
04:44:42.750 --> 04:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
would so those are the main reasons why
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's good legislation but
 
04:44:47.430 --> 04:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's additional advantages that I
 
04:44:49.510 --> 04:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
just want to point out and and that is
 
04:44:53.550 --> 04:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
one as as the sponsor spoke and said
 
04:44:56.070 --> 04:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's enabling legislation it's not a
 
04:44:58.990 --> 04:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
mandate and people appreciate that they
 
04:45:01.788 --> 04:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
don't like to be told you must do this
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
but if you approach them and say hey
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
here's something you know if we all vote
 
04:45:07.708 --> 04:45:07.718 align:start position:0%
on it we can
 
04:45:09.510 --> 04:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
works um and it's a local funding effort
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
that we can control and put our effort
 
04:45:21.030 --> 04:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
into uh and as I said before the current
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
Village districts that we have in in
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
North would really work very well and so
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
the idea that this could help us with
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
our Lakes is really important so I
 
04:45:34.510 --> 04:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
really would appreciate if you you would
 
04:45:36.670 --> 04:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank
 
04:45:40.990 --> 04:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions representative
 
04:45:43.150 --> 04:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I don't have
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
any quibble with the substance of the
 
04:45:53.310 --> 04:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
bill but my question has to do with the
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
words protection and
 
04:45:58.510 --> 04:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
Remediation ah they're they're
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
vague yes I think purposely so I'm sorry
 
04:46:03.708 --> 04:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
for interrupting yes but I mean who who
 
04:46:03.718 --> 04:46:04.750 align:start position:0%
for interrupting yes but I mean who who
decides

04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
decides
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
what is protecting who decides what
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
remediation is
 
04:46:11.868 --> 04:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
sufficient I think that's the beauty of
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
the bill it's part of the village
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
District they decide so just as an
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
example we have a village district for
 
04:46:23.070 --> 04:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
water we have a a water tank we have a
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
water system it distributes it to
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
certain people that's their goal we have
 
04:46:30.310 --> 04:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
a village District that has to deal with
 
04:46:32.788 --> 04:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
road maintenance one of them only does
 
04:46:35.788 --> 04:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
plowing one of them does plowing and
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
upgrades to the road so it's each
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
Village District that determines that
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
and for example in this case you might
 
04:46:44.040 --> 04:46:44.868 align:start position:0%
and for example in this case you might
have

04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:46:48.390 --> 04:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
some water bodies that are interested in
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
the lake host program and focus on that
 
04:46:53.430 --> 04:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
you might have others that are worried
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
about cyano bacteria and the Watershed
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
as a whole they might focus on that I
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
know for sure Northwood lake is going to
 
04:47:03.788 --> 04:47:03.798 align:start position:0%
focus on both because they have both
 
04:47:03.798 --> 04:47:06.590 align:start position:0%
focus on both because they have both
those

04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
concerns for questions seeing none thank
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:24.350 --> 04:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
Edwards and I always forget to remind if

favor or not but please do state that uh
 
04:47:33.390 --> 04:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
we up here with the pink cards know what
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're doing the rest of the committee
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
and the audience does
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
not good afternoon my name is Tom

Edwards and uh I'm here to offer my
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
opinion on this bill I want to highlight
 
04:47:49.788 --> 04:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that I describe in
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
more detail in the letter that is being
 
04:47:51.840 --> 04:47:52.830 align:start position:0%
more detail in the letter that is being
passed

04:47:52.830 --> 04:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
around uh and also to make myself
 
04:47:57.390 --> 04:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
available for questions at the end or
 
04:48:00.190 --> 04:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
even later should you desire first know
 
04:48:02.510 --> 04:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
that I am here representing only myself
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
but I want you to know that I am a I was
 
04:48:07.470 --> 04:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
an officer of the puff Pond
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
Association um for 16 years I spent
 
04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
eight as a secretary and most recently
 
04:48:17.548 --> 04:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
the eight as its president so what I am
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
bringing to the party today is
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
experience that experience is what I
 
04:48:27.788 --> 04:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
believe uh is perhaps missing uh in some
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
of these
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
testimonies I remain active in the
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit corporation I do not have
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
knowledge of these issues but am by no
 
04:48:39.788 --> 04:48:39.798 align:start position:0%
means an expert I do support the
 
04:48:39.798 --> 04:48:42.110 align:start position:0%
means an expert I do support the
proposed

04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
legislation I believe that this
 
04:48:46.510 --> 04:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
legislation will close some gaps that
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
currently exist for ensuring that New
 
04:48:51.190 --> 04:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's over a thousand ponds and
 
04:48:52.750 --> 04:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
lakes remain
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
attractive commercially robust and
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
recreationally viable it pains me to see
 
04:49:03.070 --> 04:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Dees having to issue
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
ever more
 
04:49:06.990 --> 04:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria advisories and warnings
 
04:49:10.470 --> 04:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
for our many pawns and lakes I have been
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
unable to find any of my Pawn side
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
Property Owners some who have been there
 
04:49:18.670 --> 04:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
for many many years to recall any
 
04:49:22.590 --> 04:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
incidents of the pawn having cob
 
04:49:26.750 --> 04:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
Scio cyanobacteria pardon me prior to
 
04:49:31.070 --> 04:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
the last few years none it didn't exist
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
this at least it was not noted this is
 
04:49:35.788 --> 04:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
not not a good Trend here we need to get
 
04:49:40.510 --> 04:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:43.390 --> 04:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
lakes generally storm water runoff is
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
considered the primary suspect
 
04:49:48.868 --> 04:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:52.510 --> 04:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
blooms and that is within the reach
 
04:49:55.350 --> 04:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
where local M municipalities and
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
individuals can make a difference but
 
04:49:59.230 --> 04:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
they need the
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
tools this bill can provide those tools
 
04:50:06.750 --> 04:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
the ability of folks with interest in a
 
04:50:08.670 --> 04:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
given Pond or lake cannot today use
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
their local knowledge of the pond or
 
04:50:13.750 --> 04:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
lake to properly gather the data
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to effectively improve the
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
management of the quality of water in
 
04:50:20.750 --> 04:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
their Pond or
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
lake uh business uh management 101 says
 
04:50:28.030 --> 04:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
if you do not measure it you cannot
 
04:50:28.040 --> 04:50:28.910 align:start position:0%
if you do not measure it you cannot
manage

04:50:28.910 --> 04:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
manage
 
04:50:28.920 --> 04:50:30.670 align:start position:0%
manage
it

04:50:30.670 --> 04:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities with the aid of local
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
residents do not have access to either
 
04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
the Authority or the tools to gather the
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
necessary data to even begin to
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
understand what
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
real what really is driving the issues
 
04:50:48.310 --> 04:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
with water quality degradation in their
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
local body of
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
water they don't have the tools to
 
04:50:54.390 --> 04:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
require Shoreland Property Owners to
 
04:50:57.628 --> 04:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
determine let alone report on their
 
04:50:59.708 --> 04:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
property concerning septic graywater
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
systems performance or storm water
 
04:51:05.390 --> 04:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
runoff areas that could be contributing
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
to the well-being of the body of water
 
04:51:11.470 --> 04:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
again this legislation can close that
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
Gap since this is enabling legislation
 
04:51:19.030 --> 04:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities and locals do not who do
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
not wish to do anything can continue to
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
choose to do nothing and wait for
 
04:51:26.190 --> 04:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
somebody else to solve the problem while
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
some communities will delay or even
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
scoff at doing anything this legislation
 
04:51:32.788 --> 04:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
is aimed directly at those
 
04:51:32.798 --> 04:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
is aimed directly at those
municipalities

04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:51:36.548 --> 04:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
where there are resources just waiting
 
04:51:39.470 --> 04:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
to be sprung into action by the addition
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
of this element to
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
52.1 this legislation will open up a
 
04:51:46.990 --> 04:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
toolkit to a narrow group of
 
04:51:49.948 --> 04:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities and individuals with
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
potentially having systemic impact on
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
the quality of our ponds and lakes which
 
04:51:58.150 --> 04:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
we also
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
enjoy I encourage you to recommend that
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
this bill be passed into law thank you
 
04:52:03.760 --> 04:52:05.788 align:start position:0%
this bill be passed into law thank you
any

04:52:05.788 --> 04:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:52:08.430 --> 04:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for thank you for
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
Testimony representative majori thank
 
04:52:12.030 --> 04:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:52:14.230 --> 04:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
my question which which may be better
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
suited for representative wolf and and
 
04:52:18.190 --> 04:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
please tell me if it is you mentioned a
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
few words in there systemic problem and
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
in a toolbox I'm curious of the of the
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
village districts and and maybe
 
04:52:28.190 --> 04:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
specifically you can answer this where
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
you have multiple districts on one body
 
04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
of water where we may have to work on
 
04:52:37.150 --> 04:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
how those districts are cooperating
 
04:52:40.830 --> 04:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
together to be able to effectuate that
 
04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
systemic Improvement that you're that
 
04:52:44.830 --> 04:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
you refer to does that make any
 
04:52:47.948 --> 04:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
sense it I suspect it does but for a
 
04:52:50.510 --> 04:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
larger Pond I come from clu Pond I have
 
04:52:52.430 --> 04:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
property on the shoreline for the last
 
04:52:56.350 --> 04:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
18 years and the uh the pond itself is
 
04:52:59.948 --> 04:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
44 acres and while we do cross town
 
04:53:01.948 --> 04:53:01.958 align:start position:0%
boundaries we have just one piece of
 
04:53:05.310 --> 04:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
property in Canterbury not in Lowden
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
that is on Shoreline but the extent of
 
04:53:12.190 --> 04:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
some of the issues go beyond the actual
 
04:53:14.990 --> 04:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
Shoreline itself as I pointed out in my
 
04:53:18.750 --> 04:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
letter uh some of it is the based on the
 
04:53:21.708 --> 04:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
landscape we have uh one side of the
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
pond has quite a section of Hills where
 
04:53:27.390 --> 04:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of runoff and the property
 
04:53:30.548 --> 04:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
owner that is on the shoreline is
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged trying to fix their runoff
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
because it's emanating from above them
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
further on the hill on the other side
 
04:53:41.150 --> 04:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
we're much more flat and it doesn't go
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
as wide so a village District can
 
04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
surround the pond with the relevant um
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh folks that are needed uh if this is a
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
large lake like a wiip pasak where there
 
04:54:00.110 --> 04:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
are all different uh sections I don't
 
04:54:02.590 --> 04:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
see how one could coordinate or would
 
04:54:05.390 --> 04:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
want to from Meredith down to Walton
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
those are they got very different
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
problems at different ends of the lake
 
04:54:11.470 --> 04:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
that would my perspective is very small
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
pwn thank
 
04:54:16.750 --> 04:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
you further questions seeing none thank
 
04:54:18.390 --> 04:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
04:54:29.470 --> 04:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:33.150 --> 04:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
Laro good afternoon and and thank you um
 
04:54:34.990 --> 04:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee I'm
 
04:54:37.230 --> 04:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
Andrea Laro the president of New
 
04:54:40.230 --> 04:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes and right now um being
 
04:54:41.910 --> 04:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
passed around to is a letter of
 
04:54:44.150 --> 04:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
testimony from New Hampshire lakes and
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
in support a letter of testimony from
 
04:54:48.548 --> 04:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
the Lakes management advisory committee
 
04:54:51.310 --> 04:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
in support and a letter of testimony in
 
04:54:54.390 --> 04:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
support from the rivers management um
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
committee so New Hampshire Lakes were a
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide nonprofit organization with a
 
04:55:01.548 --> 04:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
mission of restoring and preserving the
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
health of our Lakes and to build upon uh
 
04:55:07.868 --> 04:55:07.878 align:start position:0%
what everyone else has said
 
04:55:10.750 --> 04:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
already the the point I wanted to bring
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
out is that there are hundreds um of
 
04:55:18.190 --> 04:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
Lake Associations local community groups
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
around the state that are working in
 
04:55:25.590 --> 04:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
various levels with this New Hampshire
 
04:55:28.150 --> 04:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services on
 
04:55:31.270 --> 04:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
what are called Lake management plans
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire does have
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
rules and laws and funding for Lake to
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
help restore and preserve the health of
 
04:55:41.070 --> 04:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
our Lakes but it's not enough and the
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
beauty of of this is that we have again
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
hundreds of uh local groups that are
 
04:55:51.750 --> 04:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
interested and willing to um help better
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
protect and restore Lake quality on the
 
04:55:56.548 --> 04:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
landscape and they're just waiting for a
 
04:56:00.510 --> 04:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
tool to do so um so with that I would be
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
04:56:04.590 --> 04:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for the testimony
 
04:56:09.868 --> 04:56:09.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:12.110 --> 04:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
testimony perfect thank you one last
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
pink card if there's anybody else who
 
04:56:18.470 --> 04:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
intended to speak make
 
04:56:20.670 --> 04:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
sure you
 
04:56:23.190 --> 04:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
have filled out a pink

one oh it's already on thank you my name

is Jack cutner I am in Newberry which is

on Lake
 
04:56:53.110 --> 04:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
sunap um my perspective is a little
 
04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
different from some of the earlier
 
04:56:58.548 --> 04:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
testimony because in fact I see this
 
04:57:02.948 --> 04:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
legislation um as a way to enable better
 
04:57:02.958 --> 04:57:03.788 align:start position:0%
legislation um as a way to enable better
ACC

ACC
 
04:57:08.190 --> 04:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
on a large lake where there are multiple
 
04:57:11.110 --> 04:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are jointly
 
04:57:15.030 --> 04:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
responsible um for the quality of the
 
04:57:19.470 --> 04:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
Watershed um my experience is as
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
follows Lake sop protective Association
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
in 2020 completed an extensive study on
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
water quality on lake stie and Lake stie
 
04:57:33.788 --> 04:57:33.798 align:start position:0%
while relatively pristine
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
is like all water bodies in New
 
04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire water quality is is on the is
 
04:57:45.190 --> 04:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
on decline in Decline and the reason for
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
that is is rather simple a as more and
 
04:57:51.070 --> 04:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
more development happens around the lake
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
within the Watershed there's a finite
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
amount that the Lakes can
 
04:57:59.548 --> 04:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
absorb as construction occurs there's
 
04:58:01.548 --> 04:58:01.558 align:start position:0%
more and more runoff more and more
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
septics septic fail failure Road salts
 
04:58:09.270 --> 04:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
Etc it
 
04:58:12.708 --> 04:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
is interesting when you decide to take
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
on the Clause with the local communities
 
04:58:19.548 --> 04:58:19.558 align:start position:0%
to say we need to be more proactive what
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
you quickly realize is no one is
 
04:58:26.030 --> 04:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for water quality within the
 
04:58:29.310 --> 04:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
Sunapee Watershed why do I say that
 
04:58:32.030 --> 04:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
because everybody is responsible and
 
04:58:35.190 --> 04:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
when everybody's responsible nobody is
 
04:58:37.628 --> 04:58:37.638 align:start position:0%
responsible what representative Wolf's
 
04:58:40.830 --> 04:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
legislation would do was create a is
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
create a framework where the towns would
 
04:58:49.070 --> 04:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
agree to participate and cooperate to
 
04:58:51.788 --> 04:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
create a single set of rules and a
 
04:58:55.150 --> 04:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
single set of authority to
 
04:58:58.548 --> 04:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
get protective action in place for Lake
 
04:59:01.750 --> 04:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
cipe this obviously could become a model
 
04:59:07.548 --> 04:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
for other large Lakes um seano bacteria
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
is an epidemic problem chloride in the
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
lake is accumulating slowly because of
 
04:59:13.798 --> 04:59:14.590 align:start position:0%
lake is accumulating slowly because of
Road

04:59:14.590 --> 04:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
Road
 
04:59:17.590 --> 04:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
salts many of the towns don't have
 
04:59:20.430 --> 04:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
septic regulations in place septic tanks
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
are failing and leaking into the water
 
04:59:25.470 --> 04:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
table and into the lake and as you go
 
04:59:28.948 --> 04:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
from town to town you find every set of
 
04:59:31.230 --> 04:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
zoning requirements is different
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement is spotty or non existent
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
and this would be an uh uh an
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
empowerment to try and get in front of
 
04:59:42.628 --> 04:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
the protection that's needed for really
 
04:59:45.430 --> 04:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
what is New Hampshire's arguably
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
greatest natural resource which is which
 
04:59:50.190 --> 04:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
is our Lakes thank you for listening
 
04:59:52.750 --> 04:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.350 --> 04:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for Testimony
 
04:59:59.670 --> 04:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:00:02.750 --> 05:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you all right seeing no more
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
pink cards uh we uh we did have a blue
 
05:00:09.190 --> 05:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
sheet on it not sure where that
 
05:00:12.548 --> 05:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
went there was a number of individuals
 
05:00:16.270 --> 05:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.110 --> 05:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
favor looks like six in favor so with
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we will go ahead and close the
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.920 --> 05:00:37.110 align:start position:0%
 
1250

05:00:37.110 --> 05:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:37.120 --> 05:00:40.110 align:start position:0%
 
hi

05:00:40.110 --> 05:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
Laura okay we're down to the last bill
 
05:00:43.948 --> 05:00:43.958 align:start position:0%
of the day we're going to go ahead and
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
open up HB uh hearing on hb1 1297
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the authority of
 
05:00:53.990 --> 05:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:56.990 --> 05:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances uh Prime sponsor Ellen Reed
 
05:01:00.030 --> 05:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
you are up thank you once again Mr chair
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you again members of the
 
05:01:03.788 --> 05:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
committee again and for the record my
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
name is Ellen Reed I represent
 
05:01:09.110 --> 05:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 new market and new Fields
 
05:01:12.708 --> 05:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
um so before you was a little bit of an
 
05:01:15.628 --> 05:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
idea that I had as a kind of
 
05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
compromise um you are likely aware as
 
05:01:21.628 --> 05:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
the municipal committee that not just in
 
05:01:24.030 --> 05:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
this state but actually Nationwide as we
 
05:01:25.470 --> 05:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
are experiencing
 
05:01:28.628 --> 05:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
increasing uh demand in in and
 
05:01:30.868 --> 05:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
increasing suffering in the housing
 
05:01:36.070 --> 05:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
crisis that one of the trends how I say
 
05:01:38.110 --> 05:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
Trends one of the resorts that people
 
05:01:40.708 --> 05:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
are taking is to undo some of the
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning that towns have
 
05:01:47.070 --> 05:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
historically done so I want to bring up
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and I and there's two pieces to this
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of ordinances and so just
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
permit me to get there but I want to go
 
05:01:57.670 --> 05:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
into a little bit of history in 1926
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
there was a supreme court Federal
 
05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision which you may be
 
05:02:04.590 --> 05:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
aware of called uclid V amly company
 
05:02:07.110 --> 05:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
that decision was essentially the
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
decision was that the ability for
 
05:02:12.750 --> 05:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have police power
 
05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
valid police power in other words for
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
them to uh pass ordinances that have uh
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
legal Authority is based on public
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety in other words there
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
is no constitutional guarantee and it's
 
05:02:29.830 --> 05:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
probably unlikely that municipalities
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
have the Constitutional ability to pass
 
05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
ordinances that are not based on public
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
health and safety and yet and two years
 
05:02:40.030 --> 05:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
later in 1928 the New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
Court decided very similarly in the case
 
05:02:46.110 --> 05:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
sundine versus Rogers um specifically
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
there there was uh the question of
 
05:02:50.470 --> 05:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not a town could restrict
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not an auxiliary building
 
05:02:53.910 --> 05:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
like a barn or garage could be in the
 
05:02:55.670 --> 05:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
front or had to be in the rear of a
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
property and the court um decided that
 
05:03:02.350 --> 05:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
if it was for the appropriate usage of
 
05:03:06.670 --> 05:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
light air to to reduce the risk of fires
 
05:03:08.990 --> 05:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
or to reduce the risk of auto accidents
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
then a town could restricted but not
 
05:03:15.510 --> 05:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily for aesthetic purposes so
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
that was our Supreme Court decision two
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
years after the uclid decision and they
 
05:03:20.830 --> 05:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
basically backed up what the federal
 
05:03:25.390 --> 05:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
courts had said around that time is when
 
05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
um redlining became a thing and so
 
05:03:31.110 --> 05:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances were increasingly used
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
to keep certain types of people uh
 
05:03:35.948 --> 05:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
people who were considered to be
 
05:03:37.788 --> 05:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
undesirable by the people who were in
 
05:03:41.230 --> 05:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
charge of towns out of those towns or
 
05:03:43.750 --> 05:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
restrict them out of certain areas of
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
those Towns now while we may not have
 
05:03:49.830 --> 05:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
technical redlining anymore what we do
 
05:03:54.430 --> 05:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
have is still to this day um the very
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
clear effort to keep certain types of
 
05:03:58.948 --> 05:03:58.958 align:start position:0%
people and it may be not based on race
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
anymore but it's definitely at a very
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
bare minimum based on economic
 
05:04:08.190 --> 05:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
strata so um let me just read from uid
 
05:04:11.190 --> 05:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's the federal Supreme Court case
 
05:04:12.990 --> 05:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the power to
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
regulate the height of buildings area of
 
05:04:16.590 --> 05:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
occupation strength of building
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
materials and I'm going to condense this
 
05:04:22.510 --> 05:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
um in the interest of Public Safety and
 
05:04:25.628 --> 05:04:25.638 align:start position:0%
Health however we believe it however to
 
05:04:27.548 --> 05:04:27.558 align:start position:0%
be the law that these Powers must be
 
05:04:28.990 --> 05:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
reasonably exercised and that a
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
municipality may not under the guise of
 
05:04:33.628 --> 05:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
the police power arbitrarily divert
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
property from its appropriate and most
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
economical use or diminish its value by
 
05:04:39.470 --> 05:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
imposing restrictions which have no
 
05:04:42.190 --> 05:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
other basis than the momentary Taste of
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:04:43.680 --> 05:04:45.788 align:start position:0%
the public
authorities

05:04:45.788 --> 05:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
05:04:48.510 --> 05:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
nor can police regulations be used to
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
affect the arbitrary desire to have a
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
municipality resist the operation of
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
economic laws and remain rural exclusive
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
and aesthetic when its land is needed to
 
05:05:00.430 --> 05:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
be otherwise developed by the larger
 
05:05:03.510 --> 05:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
public good and public welfare I think
 
05:05:05.310 --> 05:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that everyone has a place to
 
05:05:07.310 --> 05:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
live in this state is certainly
 
05:05:09.868 --> 05:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
qualifies as the public good and public
 
05:05:09.878 --> 05:05:11.868 align:start position:0%
qualifies as the public good and public
welfare

05:05:11.868 --> 05:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
welfare
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
so having said that the first part of
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
this kind of compromise I came up with
 
05:05:21.510 --> 05:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
is saying that those residential
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
ordinances by the way just specifically
 
05:05:26.350 --> 05:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
residential ordinances cannot be passed
 
05:05:27.990 --> 05:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
if they are not directly tied to the
 
05:05:29.628 --> 05:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
best scientific understanding in the
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
moment of health and safety of the
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
residents that means that as technology
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
is improving or as more Technologies are
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
available as long as those Technologies
 
05:05:46.590 --> 05:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
meet federal and state requirements for
 
05:05:48.430 --> 05:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
health and safety that the town can't
 
05:05:50.548 --> 05:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
restricted so this is things like tiny
 
05:05:52.948 --> 05:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
homes if the tiny home meets federal and
 
05:05:54.788 --> 05:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
state requirements the town should not
 
05:05:56.670 --> 05:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
be able to restrict it because the town
 
05:05:58.910 --> 05:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
can only restrict on the basis of health
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
05:06:06.830 --> 05:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
um quanite homes prefabricated homes uh
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
certain septic Technologies Energy
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies water Technologies these
 
05:06:13.948 --> 05:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
are all becoming more and more available
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
however towns seem to be kind of stuck
 
05:06:18.628 --> 05:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
in the past when it comes to what they
 
05:06:21.590 --> 05:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
will allow and it's getting to the point
 
05:06:23.670 --> 05:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
that we're in a housing crisis we have
 
05:06:25.628 --> 05:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
no option but to get creative and if
 
05:06:27.788 --> 05:06:27.798 align:start position:0%
those technologies that exist now we're
 
05:06:29.190 --> 05:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
not saying people should be allowed to
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
like build Huts but if the technology is
 
05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
good and the FEDS say it's good and the
 
05:06:37.030 --> 05:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
state says it's good and the town has no
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
health and safety scientifically founded
 
05:06:41.788 --> 05:06:41.798 align:start position:0%
health and safety reason to prohibit it
 
05:06:44.310 --> 05:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
then we should not be prohibiting it so
 
05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
that's the first part the second part of
 
05:06:49.150 --> 05:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
this is kind of almost the inverse
 
05:06:51.430 --> 05:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
because we are in a Dylan's rule state I
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
actually uh Prime sponsored two attempts
 
05:06:56.110 --> 05:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
for a constitutional amendment to give
 
05:06:58.948 --> 05:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
towns the authority to pass rights-based
 
05:07:01.390 --> 05:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
ordinances to protect health and safety
 
05:07:03.190 --> 05:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
of their residents
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
this is a much smaller version of those
 
05:07:07.708 --> 05:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendments that I
 
05:07:10.030 --> 05:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
attempted but this essentially enabling
 
05:07:13.150 --> 05:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that we enable towns to also
 
05:07:14.670 --> 05:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
pass ordinances when it comes to
 
05:07:17.070 --> 05:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
commercial activity that would harm the
 
05:07:20.030 --> 05:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
health and safety of their residents so
 
05:07:23.190 --> 05:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
not say we don't like that the look of
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
that warehouse so we're not going to
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
allow that company that wouldn't be okay
 
05:07:30.310 --> 05:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
but what would be okay is you can't have
 
05:07:33.548 --> 05:07:33.558 align:start position:0%
that posos company putting chemicals in
 
05:07:36.868 --> 05:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
our River or you can't in very famously
 
05:07:38.548 --> 05:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
in our area since we were talking about
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
Durham Lee very famously 15ish years ago
 
05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
had USA Springs come in and uh try to
 
05:07:47.788 --> 05:07:47.798 align:start position:0%
take all of their water and the problem
 
05:07:49.628 --> 05:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
is is that the entity that's in charge
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
of whether or not that's allowed is Dees
 
05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
but Dees acts as a rubber stamp as a way
 
05:07:57.430 --> 05:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
to help approve these projects and the
 
05:08:00.270 --> 05:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
local people who it impacts have no
 
05:08:02.948 --> 05:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
ability to stop those projects
 
05:08:05.670 --> 05:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
even if it directly harms their health
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
and safety so this is enabling towns to
 
05:08:11.230 --> 05:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
pass ordinances that they have not
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
previously been able to to protect
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
health and safety from certain dangerous
 
05:08:18.590 --> 05:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
commercial activity and it's also saying
 
05:08:21.070 --> 05:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
you can't pass residential ordinances if
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's not for health and safety um I
 
05:08:26.470 --> 05:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
thought this was a good compromise uh
 
05:08:29.948 --> 05:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
officials in municipalities not all but
 
05:08:31.948 --> 05:08:31.958 align:start position:0%
some the ones perhaps more influential
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the municipal Association probably
 
05:08:36.990 --> 05:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
didn't agree but you know what they say
 
05:08:40.708 --> 05:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
about compromises um you know you've
 
05:08:42.788 --> 05:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
done a good job if everybody walks away
 
05:08:42.798 --> 05:08:44.510 align:start position:0%
done a good job if everybody walks away
unhappy

05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
unhappy
 
05:08:49.110 --> 05:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
so I did want to read one last piece of
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
uid because this is an example in every
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
ordered Society the state must act as an
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
Umpire and this is going to the the
 
05:09:00.590 --> 05:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
commercial the ability to have
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
ordinances on basis of health and safety
 
05:09:04.470 --> 05:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
against certain dangerous commercial
 
05:09:06.990 --> 05:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
activity in every order ordered Society
 
05:09:08.990 --> 05:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
the state must act as an Umpire to the
 
05:09:11.590 --> 05:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
extent of preventing one man from so
 
05:09:13.470 --> 05:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
using his property or rights as to
 
05:09:16.390 --> 05:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
prevent others from making uh from
 
05:09:18.270 --> 05:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
making a correspondingly full and free
 
05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
use of their property and rights the
 
05:09:22.430 --> 05:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
abstract right of a man to build a fire
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
trap is limited by the rights of other
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
people not to have their houses
 
05:09:28.110 --> 05:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
subjected to the Peril by it the right
 
05:09:30.430 --> 05:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
of a man to maintain a nuisance on his
 
05:09:32.350 --> 05:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
own property is limited by the right of
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
others to not be subjected to the danger
 
05:09:36.510 --> 05:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
of its proximity accordingly the
 
05:09:38.230 --> 05:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
so-called police pow is an inherent
 
05:09:39.628 --> 05:09:39.638 align:start position:0%
right on the part of the public umpire
 
05:09:42.070 --> 05:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
to prevent misuses of property or rights
 
05:09:44.990 --> 05:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
which impair health or safety so once
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
again towns have the Constitutional
 
05:09:50.110 --> 05:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
ability to pass ordinances for health
 
05:09:52.670 --> 05:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
and safety but even as they're saying
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
that it's on the basis of we're allowing
 
05:09:59.230 --> 05:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
we C we can prohibit activity that takes
 
05:10:01.350 --> 05:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
away other people's rights but we can't
 
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
prohibit activ
 
05:10:05.510 --> 05:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
beyond that and that is actually called
 
05:10:07.868 --> 05:10:07.878 align:start position:0%
the Lafayette principle that we should
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
govern only in so far as we we remove
 
05:10:13.390 --> 05:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
rights that take away other people's
 
05:10:15.270 --> 05:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
rights you have the right to do anything
 
05:10:18.030 --> 05:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
except take away other people's rights
 
05:10:23.708 --> 05:10:23.718 align:start position:0%
um so that's the the gist of it and I I
 
05:10:25.230 --> 05:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
just really wanted to have this
 
05:10:27.628 --> 05:10:27.638 align:start position:0%
conversation because I think we've run
 
05:10:31.150 --> 05:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
really far field of the original uh 1926
 
05:10:33.270 --> 05:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court UK decision as well as the
 
05:10:37.628 --> 05:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
28 Sund Dean Rogers decision um where we
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be primarily and only
 
05:10:41.670 --> 05:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
exclusively making sure people's health
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
and safety is taken care of and I'm
 
05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:49.470 --> 05:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:10:53.548 --> 05:10:53.558 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative so if my contacts are
 
05:11:00.548 --> 05:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
working properly at this time of day so
 
05:11:03.868 --> 05:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
this is all brand new section that
 
05:11:03.878 --> 05:11:04.628 align:start position:0%
this is all brand new section that
you're

05:11:04.628 --> 05:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
adding and it says to amend 674 by
 
05:11:08.798 --> 05:11:10.910 align:start position:0%
adding and it says to amend 674 by
inserting

05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
inserting
 
05:11:15.548 --> 05:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
after section 76 but why on line four is
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
it numbered
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
77 I believe it was not that long ago
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the answer to a similar question
 
05:11:30.270 --> 05:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
was this language was drafted by an
 
05:11:32.190 --> 05:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
attorney in OS who specializes is a
 
05:11:35.430 --> 05:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
municipal law and so while that may be a
 
05:11:37.788 --> 05:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
mistake I would have to ask that
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
particular attorney if that is a mistake
 
05:11:40.080 --> 05:11:42.750 align:start position:0%
particular attorney if that is a mistake
or

05:11:42.750 --> 05:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:46.310 --> 05:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
not followup follow up go ahead um so
 
05:11:49.270 --> 05:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking at the statute right now
 
05:11:53.510 --> 05:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
in in statute we have section 674 colon
 
05:11:56.708 --> 05:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
76 religious use of land and
 
05:11:59.548 --> 05:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
structures so I think that there's a not
 
05:12:01.470 --> 05:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
intending to overwrite the existing
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
legis ation or existing law rather and I
 
05:12:06.190 --> 05:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate the
 
05:12:09.390 --> 05:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
correction further further questions
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
represent uh
 
05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:12:15.628 --> 05:12:15.638 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I was curious
 
05:12:18.150 --> 05:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
about line
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
15 um where we don't apply this to
 
05:12:23.310 --> 05:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
commercial structures and Commercial
 
05:12:25.868 --> 05:12:25.878 align:start position:0%
zones that's that's fine and the multif
 
05:12:27.670 --> 05:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
family structure units but why
 
05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions why doesn't it apply to
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
subdivisions because as I so again I
 
05:12:37.070 --> 05:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
actually was trying to get a compromise
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
with the municipal Association so I
 
05:12:42.190 --> 05:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to limit it as much as possible
 
05:12:44.110 --> 05:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
subdivisions kind of being their own
 
05:12:47.070 --> 05:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
thing and being allowed based on what
 
05:12:50.750 --> 05:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
they've already planned um that is why I
 
05:12:53.948 --> 05:12:53.958 align:start position:0%
separated them out but if the committee
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
so felt the need to expand it and remove
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
the limitation from subdivisions and I
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
would certainly support
 
05:13:04.150 --> 05:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
that for the question representative
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so the principal you were
 
05:13:11.150 --> 05:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
citing the lafette principal um would
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
you consider that to be essentially
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
equivalent to uh John Stewart Mills harm
 
05:13:19.830 --> 05:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
principle if you're familiar with that I
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
am familiar with it from college which
 
05:13:24.750 --> 05:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
was 20 years ago but yes my
 
05:13:26.548 --> 05:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
understanding is is very
 
05:13:29.788 --> 05:13:29.798 align:start position:0%
similar represent majori thank you Mr
 
05:13:31.110 --> 05:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:13:32.788 --> 05:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
question represent resentative in uh I
 
05:13:34.390 --> 05:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
apologize my my copy doesn't have the
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
line numbers on it but in section one
 
05:13:37.270 --> 05:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
the last sentence says that the
 
05:13:38.788 --> 05:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
ordinance must provide written findings
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
of fact and my question is uh the best
 
05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
current scientific evidence relied upon
 
05:13:48.510 --> 05:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
by the legislative body um could it
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
could could that be amended to say the
 
05:13:53.788 --> 05:13:53.798 align:start position:0%
the local land use board because as a
 
05:13:56.110 --> 05:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
planning board person we we would go out
 
05:13:59.830 --> 05:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
for expert uh findings we would go out
 
05:14:01.110 --> 05:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
for that kind of research but I would
 
05:14:03.390 --> 05:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
never ask the legislative body to direct
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
us to find the best current research do
 
05:14:09.070 --> 05:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
you mean your SE your select board the
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body of the town or of I I
 
05:14:15.948 --> 05:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
don't read this to mean the state house
 
05:14:18.430 --> 05:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
if that's what you're asking no I Mr
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
chair may I clarify uh and and it could
 
05:14:22.948 --> 05:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
be that I have it totally wrong when I
 
05:14:24.868 --> 05:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
see legislative body I think the
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
legislative body of my town Northampton
 
05:14:30.030 --> 05:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
going to Warrant to ask the legislative
 
05:14:34.030 --> 05:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
body to direct the the and I'll say
 
05:14:36.270 --> 05:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
planning board to find that local
 
05:14:38.190 --> 05:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
evidence I'm just curious if if that
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
could be tightened up to
 
05:14:42.590 --> 05:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
say a a local land use board or a
 
05:14:43.868 --> 05:14:43.878 align:start position:0%
planning board because that's who would
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
be going out to get that research I
 
05:14:48.910 --> 05:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
would be very happy to um amend it as
 
05:14:51.788 --> 05:14:51.798 align:start position:0%
you suggest it makes
 
05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
sense for the
 
05:14:56.548 --> 05:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
testimony we have one more pink card and
 
05:15:00.868 --> 05:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
that is representative U not
 
05:15:11.310 --> 05:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:13.708 --> 05:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chair members of
 
05:15:15.310 --> 05:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Philip Sherman chair
 
05:15:17.230 --> 05:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board I
 
05:15:19.830 --> 05:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
oppose this uh but only on a matter of
 
05:15:22.750 --> 05:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
clarity uh this issue comes up because
 
05:15:25.030 --> 05:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
many of the municipal actions on related
 
05:15:26.910 --> 05:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
to building codes still travel through
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
the land use sections you may hear more
 
05:15:31.310 --> 05:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
about that next year if we can ever find
 
05:15:36.510 --> 05:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the pile um so the bill is
 
05:15:39.548 --> 05:15:39.558 align:start position:0%
unclear as at least as I read it as to
 
05:15:41.310 --> 05:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's intended to apply to only
 
05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
zoning and planning type ordinances or
 
05:15:47.070 --> 05:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
all land use ordinances which can
 
05:15:48.830 --> 05:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
include some amendments to the building
 
05:15:51.548 --> 05:15:51.558 align:start position:0%
code for instance is the prohibition on
 
05:15:54.548 --> 05:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
housing ordinances involving energy
 
05:15:56.590 --> 05:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
intended to prohibit local amendments to
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code involving the
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
energy code and so on with some of the
 
05:16:02.350 --> 05:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
other issues
 
05:16:04.510 --> 05:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
um so I respectfully suggest that this
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
bill be amended somehow to clearly State
 
05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
whether the intent is to permit
 
05:16:10.990 --> 05:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
amendments to the building code that
 
05:16:13.708 --> 05:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
impact housing in either a positive or
 
05:16:16.310 --> 05:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
negative light uh and I'm happy to work
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
with anybody who wants to to talk about
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
the wording on that I'm willing to
 
05:16:23.470 --> 05:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions at this point thank
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony are there any
 
05:16:29.150 --> 05:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
much thank you I don't have any more pin
 
05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
cards I have had one uh nhma signed in
 
05:16:37.390 --> 05:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
against I don't see anybody here from NH
 
05:16:40.350 --> 05:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
at the moment so with that we will go
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
ahead and close the hearing on HB
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
1297 that is the end of our agenda for
 
05:16:48.000 --> 05:16:50.750 align:start position:0%
1297 that is the end of our agenda for
today

05:16:50.750 --> 05:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
um should be in the calendar going out
 
05:16:55.830 --> 05:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's been sent to the
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
entire committee yet for next week on
 
05:17:00.110 --> 05:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we will be meeting it has been
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
sent out we have a number of bills then
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
and I
 
05:17:10.350 --> 05:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
believe that was uh check the calendar
 
05:17:12.430 --> 05:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
to be sure I believe that meeting is
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to start at 9:30 rather than 10
 
05:17:18.190 --> 05:17:18.200 align:start position:0%
that's just because of the bills that we
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
have I don't want uh I don't want to run
 
05:17:21.948 --> 05:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
out of time so we're going to start at
 
05:17:25.948 --> 05:17:25.958 align:start position:0%
9:30 next Tuesday all right questions
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:30.400 --> 05:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
weekend
