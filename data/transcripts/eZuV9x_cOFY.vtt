00:01:58.840 --> 00:04:41.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh I was at two minutes of 10 I was
 
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
waiting to see if we get our other
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
members but now it's 10:03 so I'm going
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
to convene uh this meeting of the
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
commission on worldwide combined
 
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
reporting for un unitary businesses
 
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
um I am told that Mr Foley will be
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
present but arriving a little late and I
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
believe that may also be true with
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Murphy so we have had uh seven
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
active members five of them are here and
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
I think we we should just get
 
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.150 align:start position:0%
I think we we should just get
going

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
uh so I think that uh it would be worth
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
taking a moment just to review exactly
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
comment so ah
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
perfect it was worth waiting the three
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
minutes welcome everybody okay we have a
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
full house all appointed members are
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
present so
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like this morning is to
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
shape our report and know what it's
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
going to look like uh and have an
 
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
critique what each uh each other is
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
saying to the extent that there are
 
00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
differences and that uh means that uh I
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
think we can openly engage in a degree
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
of persuasion if we're inclined and uh
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
see whether we move or uh attenuate any
 
00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.350 align:start position:0%
see whether we move or uh attenuate any
position

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
so there are five documents that I've
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
just put in front of you um which Gen 4
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
has uh graciously copied for
 
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
us those include minutes of the October
 
00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
2nd meeting
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
which um I guess nobody has read yet so
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh we might take a pause read them in a
 
00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
few minutes and we could we could then
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
adopt them uh second there is a
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
memorandum dated November 1st
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
2023 this is a skeleton prepared by Gen
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
4 that shows the um the style and
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
framework of our report and its captions
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
and cover so basically all of our
 
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
commentary findings and recommendations
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
get plugged into this
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
format together with that
 
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
uh Jen has
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
prepared a uh
 
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:37.879 align:start position:0%
bibliography of cases resources
 
00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0%
available online generally on the topic
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
and additional resources that have been
 
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 align:start position:0%
directly presented to us by our
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
presenters at our prior
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
hearings so that bibliography will be
 
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
attached and be incorporated into the
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
report itself those two documents
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
basically give you a preview of
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
report uh then the fourth and fifth
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
documents uh one is uh have both come
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
from representative shamber so he's
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
captioned one rep Tom shamberg wwcr
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
commission report and then he's also got
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
another single page proponent of wwcr
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
from Minority Report of wwcr so I know
 
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.350 align:start position:0%
from Minority Report of wwcr so I know
that

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh Tom had contemplated question whether
 
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
he would read that to us and I think
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
instead he's going to leave it to us to
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
read it but he's go he's got uh a
 
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:38.919 align:start position:0%
prepared comments he's going to make
 
00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.589 align:start position:0%
prepared comments he's going to make
verbally

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
verbally
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
um Mr Kennedy and Mr Foley have been
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
working on the pros and cons kind of the
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
the neutral view of uh uh What uh which
 
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
arguments lie on either side and uh when
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
we come to that they have something to
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
hand out as well
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
um I undertook to do uh the major uh the
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
majority opinion and and and pull
 
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
together the report and that's not ready
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
for prime time I I decided uh not to put
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
in front of you today what I've already
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
started to put together and uh to be
 
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
frank I wanted to get the sense of the
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
of the meeting today see whether
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
opinions shift see exactly what
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg is presented and
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Foley and Mr Kennedy and then
 
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
shape what I write around
 
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.630 align:start position:0%
shape what I write around
that

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh so I was starting to say that uh
 
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
let's just review specifically what our
 
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
charge is HB 102 enacted in
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
2022 um basically
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
says the commission shall study the
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
advantages and
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
disadvantages where the state's economy
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
and revenues of replacement of the
 
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
current Waters Edge method by the
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting method for
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
reporting and apportionment of income
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
under the business profits
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
tax it shall consult with national
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
experts in both methods including
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
experts so that that is the essence of
 
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
what we um are to do and I want to keep
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
us focused on exactly that I think we
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
can say with some
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
satisfaction that we have heard uh from
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
an excellent cross-section of economists
 
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
business associations and tax experts a
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
lot of what we have before us is
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
written if one was to take the time to
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
review the entirety of our record U
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
through the videos as well as reading
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's really a very very comprehensive
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
um set of views and opinions and advice
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
and and so there is no doubt in my mind
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
we've satisfied that
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
criteria so again the report then
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
advantages and
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
disadvantages for the state's economy
 
00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:20.470 align:start position:0%
disadvantages for the state's economy
and

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
revenues of changing from Water's Edge
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
to uh combined
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
I've I've done quite a bit of reading
 
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:43.959 align:start position:0%
since our last meeting I told you I'd
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
read a lot but there was still some I
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
hadn't gotten to in addition to that uh
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
we have in the
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
meantime uh gotten the report from the
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
state of
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
Maine um and also Gen 4 uh found and
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
linked a very extensive report 96 pages
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
from the state of Rhode
 
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
Island and uh I'd just like to very very
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
quickly summarize what I got out of
 
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
those two
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
reports uh first of all
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
the proposal that was before the state
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
of Maine earlier this
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
year was whether to make combined world
 
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
year was whether to make combined world
reporting

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
optional they were not proposing as has
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
been proposed here to switch to that
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
system as a
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory uh requirement they were they
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh were simply asking the question would
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
they allow it as an
 
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
option and they concluded that for many
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we've heard that it would
 
00:12:58.189 --> 00:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
be difficult to comply with difficult to
 
00:12:58.199 --> 00:12:59.430 align:start position:0%
be difficult to comply with difficult to
administer

00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
administer
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
difficult to audit but they also came
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
down quite simply on the point that
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
there wasn't really a good rationale for
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
giving the taxpayer an
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
option where you give the taxpayer an
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
option it invariably works against the
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
state's interest so we have the
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
situation where we
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
may understand that there will be
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
winners and losers and we may have no
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
ability to anticipate who the winners
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
are and who the losers are
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
what's the degree to which they're
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
winners or they losers or whether the
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
company that's a winner this year is a
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
loser next
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
year and they said when you go to an
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
optional system basically the taxpayer
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
gets to calculate the tax two ways and
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
choose the Lesser and it always comes
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
out against the state's interest so I
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
think it's it's an interesting report
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's a brief one it's seven pages if you
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
haven't read it uh you can get through
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
it pretty quickly and I think it informs
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
generally what the um challenges are of
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
the worldwide combined reporting even
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
though it was viewed in entirely
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
different context and they decided not
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
forward Rhode Island it was a very very
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
different animal and uh I'll just
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
summarize it very quickly it's about 96
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
pages they are one of the states that uh
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
continues to use a separate entity um
 
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.389 align:start position:0%
continues to use a separate entity um
system

00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh which was the uh you the approach
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
that prevailed before approximately 1980
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
and which the federal government still
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
uses so there's some very brief
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
commentary in there it's not a
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
particularly helpful report to us let's
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
just say that they
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
also concluded that they would stick
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
with what they have so they did not uh
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
move in the direction of of unitary
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
so I think at at a certain point here
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
summarize uh what I've gotten uh out of
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
all the readings in terms of how this
 
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
has evolved in the state of New
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I think I can hold that
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
and I want to just take a pause and uh
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
ask if anybody else wants to weit in at
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
this point and speak to the issue in any
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
fashion and a after we've done that
 
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
then I think I'll uh turn it to
 
00:15:31.319 --> 00:15:38.350 align:start position:0%
then I think I'll uh turn it to
representative

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
shamberg okay so
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
um representative shamberg why don't we
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
start with
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
you and uh then Mr Foley Mr Kennedy will
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
go to you and uh and I think after that
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
um I think that the volume of material
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
we have received is so voluminous I
 
00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:02.759 align:start position:0%
don't make the assumption that everyone
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
has had a chance to plow through it and
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
so uh at the risk of being somewhat
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
redundant to what you may have read I
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
would reserve some time after that to
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you Mr chairman
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
uh I have presented uh as the chair has
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
stated uh the
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
uh as a proponent
 
00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:38.550 align:start position:0%
uh as a proponent
of

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
wwcr uh a
 
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.309 align:start position:0%
wwcr uh a
basic

00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
basic
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
position that I think should be
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
recognized uh and then I if someone
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want to read that they could read
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
the bullet points okay uh and to to
 
00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:03.039 align:start position:0%
simplify it a little bit for someone to
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand but what I would like to do
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
right now is to just make
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
a oral presentation
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
about the reasoning
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
for worldwide combined
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
reporting and uh so and I'm sorry
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
there's there's no time constraint as
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned thank you
 
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
sir and it won't it won't be that that
 
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.350 align:start position:0%
sir and it won't it won't be that that
long

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh because I did type it out for
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
myself um the fundamental findings of
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
this uh worldwide combined commission
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
have found nothing to refute that
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
domestic businesses under Waters
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
Edge Waters Edge method are at a
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
disadvantage as the 1999 uh New
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court volunteered in
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
the caterpillar decision they quoted we
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
point out the waters edge method was
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
adopted for the benefit of foreign
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
businesses so what we presently have is
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
a fundamental question of the rule of
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
law there should not be two tiers in our
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
tax system any more than there should be
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
two tiers of
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
Justice uh if we're going to have two
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
tiers in our tax system as indicated by
 
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:25.950 align:start position:0%
tiers in our tax system as indicated by
the

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
1999 Supreme Court decision new
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then I say this is uh
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
anti-democratic and anti-free Market uh
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
it can only erod
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
confidence in our institutions of
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
self-government in the New Hampshire
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means Committee it would
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
be irresponsible of me and my colleagues
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh to fail in the mission to protect a
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field when it comes to tax
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
policy if we are going to pick winners
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
and losers I believe the New Hampshire
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would find it
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
unconscionable that we tilt or continue
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
to tilt uh New Hampshire tax law The
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.909 align:start position:0%

these organizations know it will result
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
in showing more BPT revenue for New
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when presentations were made
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Society of
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
CPAs nothing
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
personal about challenges of the wwcr
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
that would be faced by practitioners and
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
the business Community about gathering
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
information a new le has stepped forward
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
the United States government under
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill s 638 which was signed into
 
00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
law that now requires large
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
multinational companies to begin public
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
country bycount reporting and
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
operational data to the SEC not just to
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
the Internal Revenue
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
Service the required information
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
includes but is not limited to a list of
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries their main activity their

their accumulated earnings and tangible
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
assets this information is needed by the
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
United States to improve tax enforcement
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
and arm the the
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
investors with information they need to
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
allocate their funds wisely this new
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
federal approach of country by country
 
00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:23.799 align:start position:0%
will help close
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
loopholes because of tax transparency
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
and also serves to clarify
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
and standardize reporting
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
requirements the approach of the wwcr is
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
an accounting method that staves off tax
 
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.830 align:start position:0%
an accounting method that staves off tax
avoidance

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
avoidance
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
strategies but this was received by the
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dr with a claimed neutral
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
position but the Dr implied that ending
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge method and going to the
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting would add
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
additional auditing burdens due to
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
currency and Lang language
 
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
difficulties but current New Hampshire
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
Law requires companies to rationalize
 
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
currency and language just as the
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
federal government requires these
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
companies to do Under the new federal
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
disclosure of tax Havens and offshoring
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
act the Dr is the only New Hampshire
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
organization that can take the present
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge tax method and policy and
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
either show it as an impartial tax that
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
ignores artificial legal distinctions
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
among types of businesses or it can show
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
that foreign multinationals are a
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
privileged class under the waters edge
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
method this privilege causes domestic
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
companies to pay a higher effective tax
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
rate than their multinational
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
competitors when privileged
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations shift their
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
tax revenue profits it is the smaller
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
domestic companies that have to shoulder
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
the revenue raising burden
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
since the request for the slow
 
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of the single Factor
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor was ignored without
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
hearings back in 2019 by the New
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senate The Honorable
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%

vice chair of New Hampshire Ways and
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
Means Committee wrote we may do
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
significant harm to the Financial Health
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
of our state when you take the single
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
sales Factor along with the implication
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
of what Waters Edge allows foreign
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
multinationals to do with BPT tax
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
revenues the state of New Hampshire
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
needs a law
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
implemented implemented which would
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
increase tax
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
transparency this is
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
the worldwide combined
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
reporting the wwcr tax policy increases
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
TR tax transparency and will encourage
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations to steer
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
clear of most questionable
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
practices we need to put every business
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
domestic and foreign on the same Level
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
Playing Field the state of New Hampshire
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
does not need two tiers in our tax
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
system one for foreign multinationals
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
and one for domestic
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
companies why should this commission
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
oppose fair tax policy reform for New
 
00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:23.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire domestic businesses when our
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
own New Hampshire Supreme Court has said
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
we point out that the Waters Edge method
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
was adopted for the benefit of foreign
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
businesses thank you Mr
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
shamberg are there questions for
 
00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:49.389 align:start position:0%
shamberg are there questions for
representative

00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
shamberg if you wait too long he'll put
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
his hand up I'm counting on it
 
00:25:54.919 --> 00:25:56.669 align:start position:0%
his hand up I'm counting on it
representative

00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:59.830 align:start position:0%
representative
Hy

00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um I'm reading this an
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
article here on uh from the tax
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
Foundation which questions and I just
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
got it this morning so um I will share
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
it with the committee but it questions
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
the ITP information because it uh for a
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
variety of different reasons and it also
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
suggests that the estimated
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
revenue does not take into consideration
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
the corporate task
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
portion that exists under the Water's
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
Edge Pro process I'm sure our uh CPA at
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
the end well either one of you two can
 
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.789 align:start position:0%
the end well either one of you two can
figure

00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
figure
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
out how that can be put into Layman's
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
English but it it looks to me like it's
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
a a b an imbalance in tax rate
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
application to General Revenue
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
previously Mr uh representative shamberg
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
has suggested that it is widening the
 
00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:07.310 align:start position:0%
has suggested that it is widening the
tax

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
base which may be true but it also
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
limits the ability of a corporation
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
therefore to utilize move funds shift
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
funds to areas that it may um be more
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the uh production of a
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
product that may in grow businesses for
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
example uh if a corporation is engaged
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
in harvesting hemp I'm just going to
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
stay away from Hightech
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
stuff and there's a factory in India
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
that has a very good processing
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
methodology doing on the cotton and the
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
British cotton industry there where they
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
can process this product better but it
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
grows better
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
in country a but the manufacturer of it
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
in country B is better and even there's
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
a tax difference between the two
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
countries why would the compant
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
corporation then be penalized for
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
shifting funds from growth to profits
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
from the growth and sale of that product
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
over to the manufacturing side that it's
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
located elsewhere and how does that harm
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire business that is paying
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
effectively the same tax rate you
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
indicated in your statement that it uh
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
was an unequal tax burden even
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
though we can create as it's been
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
repeatedly said under our uh under our
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
our constitution we can create different
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
classes of taxable
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
entities I'm I I really do not
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
understand that can
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
you I will try
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
to Enlighten just a little
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh I I if they
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
are at a true arms
 
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
length apart from each other and which
 
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.830 align:start position:0%
length apart from each other and which
means

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
a has
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
no connection with be in the
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
management of be's company uh true arms
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
length would be me and you working that
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
deal not
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
me as your unitary boss your unitary
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
telling you I I would like you
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
to make a deal with me that is
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
not but that's not how corporations work
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
well I realiz I'm sorry I sure no I
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
think um representative ol wants to
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
mic that's not how corporations work if
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
you've got a corporation that is
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
producing product a over here and
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
then manufactures that product or
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
refines that product or does something
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
else with that product over there it's
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
still the same
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
Corporation it and if they're not at
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
arms length they work together and by
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
working together they produce a product
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
that benefits the stockholders in the
 
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
corporation and it benefits the people
 
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:36.519 align:start position:0%
that buy the
 
00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
product because it's not you're not
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
having to produce profit for each one of
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
the company separate you're producing a
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
a product that benefits that entire
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
entity that's manufacturing that product
 
00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:52.519 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that this uh tax
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
scheme now all of them are schemes
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
well bad said that um but Frederick
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
basad a French philosopher but what I'm
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at is why would you
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
penalize a corporation from doing
 
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
business I don't think we're penalizing
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
all we're looking for is a transparency
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
shifting any of this profit that the
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
state or tax revenues at the State of
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
have for a economic advantage over a
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
domestic company that may not have
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
that uh ability to uh uh uh deal with
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
company I think when you have a unitary
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
unitary setup where you have
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries you as the top management
 
00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.269 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries you as the top management
Central

00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
Central
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
core can make and ask
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
for cost differentials that a domestic
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
company if it was to deal with a company
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
get yes so
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.870 align:start position:0%
get yes so
what

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
I go back to New Hampshire wants to make
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
sure that it is able to provide for the
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
people of this state through its public
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and it can't do it without
 
00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:43.669 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and it can't do it without
taxes

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
proper Revenue that should be accounted
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes Senator
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
murphi thank Mr chairman
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting I laid out a few
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
reasons why I didn't support the idea
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
and I still believe all of those things
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
um probably the strongest reason I
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't support it Beyond a basic
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
philosophical difference is what you've
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
labeled as sort of the weakest or least
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
persuasive argument which is the going
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
at alone you know New Hampshire has
 
00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:25.950 align:start position:0%
at alone you know New Hampshire has
about

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.230 align:start position:0%
about
4%

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
4%
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
of the states of the nation's population
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a minuscule amount um not 4%
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
.4% carry the decimal point over 0
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
4% um and I I
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
can't to me that's just a a massive
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
reason why we can't even consider this
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
seriously and at the risk of hurting my
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
own position I would suggest that if you
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
were to continue to work on this project
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
and it's something you've clearly been
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
working on for a while maybe a
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
contingency might be a way to go um if
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
10% of the country were to support it
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
maybe this goes away as a
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
reason um so you know we have a saying
 
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
legislature and I folks you've been here
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
a while as well never try to improve a
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
bad Bill
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
but this would at least address one of
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
so I think it's probably worthwhile at
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
the risk of stating the obvious to make
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
some distinctions between different
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
Corporations um we have us-based
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
corporations we have foreign-based
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
corporations we have us-based
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations and
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
foreign-based multinational corporations
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
doing business in the United
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
States we have businesses that do no
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
international business but are operating
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
in a multiple of
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
states and uh those could be New
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Corporation operating in other
 
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
states it could be a corporation from
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere else Oklahoma doing business uh
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
here and there are many corporations
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
that are doing business in most of the
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
states if not all 50 that are not
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily operating
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
multinationally so at at the end of the
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
day the common denominator in terms of
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire BPT is whether they
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm completely failing to
 
00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:47.079 align:start position:0%
see that you're making a distinction
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
between foreign multinationals and us
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
multinationals so the suggestion has
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
discriminates amongst these types of
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
businesses and specifically that it
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
discriminates against domestic
 
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
companies but the water's edge is simply
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
a way of
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
circumscribing where we're applying the
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
unitary method okay so the separate
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
filing method historically prevailed
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
before more or less 1980 is
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
little earlier in certain States 1980 in
 
00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.230 align:start position:0%
little earlier in certain States 1980 in
New

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the the separate filing method
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
continues to Prevail at the federal
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
level they've never changed it goes back
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
30s New Hampshire did adopt a unitary um
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
81 it's the the the the context of the
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
water's edge is not to change the fact
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
that we have unitary filing it's simply
 
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
to say that the businesses you that a
 
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:08.839 align:start position:0%
corporate parent may have outside the
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
country that don't themselves have an
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
Nexus are not relevant to activity in
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and therefore not relevant
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
to our desire to tax
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
fairly so we're not
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
treating us-based multinationals any
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
fact the change of law in
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
1986 was motivated by almost the
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
opposite predicament so this is subtle
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
and this didn't hit me the first time I
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
started reading these documents but on
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
much closer reading it's become very
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
clear to me from the legislative history
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
of the 198 86 law change in New
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the state of New
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire urged by the Department of
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue and uh governor governor sununu
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
the uh the first governor sununu were
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve a predicament in which
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
the state was discriminating between
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
1981 and 86 and here's here's
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
how when New Hampshire implemented
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
worldwide comb B reporting in
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
1981 they never applied it to
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
foreign based
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
multinationals that was shocking to me
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
when I read
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
that in fact there are extensive
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
passages in representative Schamberg's
 
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
tax notes article that uh confirm this
 
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.349 align:start position:0%
tax notes article that uh confirm this
very

00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
plainly and the commissioner of the
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue said quite plainly
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
out of Ways and Means Committee hearing
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
in the spring of
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
1986 that they had never received a tax
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
return from any foreign-based
 
00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:09.630 align:start position:0%
return from any foreign-based
multinational

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
multinational
 
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
corporation using the unitary
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
method so they had a conundrum they had
 
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.870 align:start position:0%
method so they had a conundrum they had
a

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
law that said New Hampshire was using
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
combined worldwide reporting but they
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
were applying it only to us-based multin
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
and foreign-based
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
multinationals were just simply skating
 
00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
along ignoring that
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
law and the officials of the State of
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire make it plain that that
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't a situation where the
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
foreign-based multinationals were just
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get away with something it was
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
an instance where the state of New
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was
 
00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:51.950 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was
completely

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
incapable and
 
00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
unprepared to enforce their own law and
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
audit Etc against the foreign-based
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
multinationals so they made it a plain
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
they plainly communicated that they
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
try so when they came to 1986 after a
 
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.069 align:start position:0%
try so when they came to 1986 after a
prior

00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
Bill the governor got so directly
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
involved in this that he personally
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
testified on at least two occasions
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
before house and Ways and Means on that
 
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.630 align:start position:0%
before house and Ways and Means on that
bill

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
urging that we move to Waters Edge so
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
that the Discrimination between domestic
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
multinationals versus foreign
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
multinationals could be
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
ended the purpose of Water's Edge was to
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that the domestic
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
multinationals and the foreign
 
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
multinationals were in fact treated
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
alike now if I'm the CEO of a US
 
00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:57.790 align:start position:0%
alike now if I'm the CEO of a US
us-based

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
us-based
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
multinational I can't see any way in
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
which I'm disadvantaged relative to my
 
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
foreign-based multinational competitor
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
were treated the same I think where
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
there is at least
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
potentially a grounds for concern and
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
criticism it's when you come to a new
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based business that's doing
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
business only in the state of New
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but those businesses including
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
the painter we heard from aren't comp
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
competing by and large with with
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
multinationals as and it's um I think it
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
was Mr Kennedy who asked uh you know
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
what does a business that's based in New
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and operating only in New
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have to
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
gain from moving away from Water's Edge
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
and back to to the worldwide combined
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
reporting and as far as I can see the
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
answer is nothing so I think that this
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
this entire proposal is
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
predicated on a conceptual problem I'm
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
not going to suggest that opportunity is
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
not present for any
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
multinational regardless of whether it's
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
to deliberately use um transfer pricing
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of
 
00:42:23.069 --> 00:42:23.079 align:start position:0%
Shifting profits to a lower tax
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction clearly that opportunity
 
00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:26.990 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction clearly that opportunity
exists

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to deny that it probably
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
happens to some degree or
 
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
another but the fact is the state of New
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire despite what its law said from
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
1981 to
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
1986 has
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
never had or
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
enforced a worldwide combined reporting
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
regime and that was really surprising
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
and enlightening to me to read everybody
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
needs to know that despite what was on
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
the books this state has never
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
implemented unified worldwide combined
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
reporting and there are reasons for
 
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.870 align:start position:0%
reporting and there are reasons for
that

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
so yesterday I said H why don't I go
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
look in my old boxes and see if I can
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
find and so uh here are my souvenirs
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
which I anybody wants to look at them
 
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
Canen but um took me three or four
 
00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
minutes to find the right box and pull
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
out the briefs that I was on to the
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
United States Supreme Court in November
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
1983 another brief in October 83 in the
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
case of shell petroleum versus Graves
 
00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:49.559 align:start position:0%
Graves being the executive officer of
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
the Franchise Tax Board State of
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
California raising issues that were not
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
actually resolved in the container case
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
which had been decided at the beginning
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
of October 83 it's very intriguing to me
 
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just speaking personally here of
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
course I took a deep dive into this very
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
thorny topic as a young associate
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
attorney with Wilmer Cutler and
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
Pickering in Washington in 1983 and that
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
case closed and we didn't the Supreme
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
Court did not Grant
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
serar and I moved on to other
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
assignments and
 
00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
here I find myself curiously 40 years
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
later having given utterly no thought to
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
the topic in the intervie years and now
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
taking a deep dive once again and the
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
basic issues and merits haven't changed
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
the allegations the the concerns that
 
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:46.589 align:start position:0%
the allegations the the concerns that
were

00:44:46.589 --> 00:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
expressed in
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
1983 are the same and they haven't
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
gotten clearer and they haven't gotten
 
00:44:53.599 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
gotten clearer and they haven't gotten
more

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.910 align:start position:0%
more
concrete

00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
so who were we representing we we were
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
representing 20 European
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
countries and the notion that there was
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
sort of a secret bargain between uh
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
President Reagan and uh prime minister
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
Thatcher has been has been
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
suggested that's really not
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
true the president's personal memo to
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
the prime minister may have been a um
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
confidential document but uh the
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
European countries were very
 
00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.109 align:start position:0%
European countries were very
actively

00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
actively
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
um lobbying against this litigating
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
against this President Reagan made it
 
00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:44.109 align:start position:0%
against this President Reagan made it
very

00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
clear that he would take actions to
 
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
dissuade the States from uh embracing or
 
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
continuing the unitary worldwide uh tax
 
00:45:59.549 --> 00:45:59.559 align:start position:0%
SCH scheme and he did it very openly um
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
a commission was convened with the
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Treasury a variety of
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
States representatives were involved and
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's what was going on in 1984 85 as a
 
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
Prelude to the
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
1986 repeal in New Hampshire New
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was one of those States that
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
had enacted unitary worldwide
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
reporting and then refrained
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
from enforcing
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
it and then backed
 
00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
off based on the encouragement of the
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
United States
 
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
government just digress for a minute to
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
some of the Constitutional issues which
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
quickly there are four constitutional
 
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
issues that I can identify that have
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
been raised at one time or another in
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
the context of this
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
issue the first one is
 
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
whether the states could if they
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
wished adopt unitary filing and more
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
specifically worldwide unitary
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
filing that has been
 
00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.630 align:start position:0%
filing that has been
resolved

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
favorably in the two cases in 83
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
container and in Barkley bank and in I
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
94 so there's no question that a state
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
this the second question is the the
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
negative uh commerce clause which is
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
pretty esoteric constitutional law
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
theory that says even when the federal
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
government has enacted there are still
 
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
reasons under the Commerce Clause why a
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
state can't take initiative to interfere
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
in the movement of Interstate
 
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
Commerce and uh I think that's pretty
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
clear that that also is not an obstacle
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
as long as Congress hasn't
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
acted and in fact Congress has not
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
acted but let's bear in mind that the
 
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause is a limitation on
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
States Powers regarding interstate
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
commerce and has nothing to say
 
00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:14.839 align:start position:0%
whatsoever about International
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
Commerce the third constitutional issue
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
is one of
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
preemption so could the Commerce Clause
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
could could the could the US Congress
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
under the federal Commerce Clause
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
law have required unitary worldwide
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
reporting yes they could have but they
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
didn't in fact they wanted to go the
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
opposite direction and what was in that
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
context what was actually going on at
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
the time of New Hampshire's 1986 repeal
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
is that there was a very strong a very
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
very uh intense
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
concern that if a bunch of States
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
continued to have a statute authorizing
 
00:48:58.750 --> 00:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting that would
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
prompt Congress to take action and
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
preempt in a way that would require
 
00:49:06.839 --> 00:49:09.870 align:start position:0%
preempt in a way that would require
separate

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
reporting so what governor cunu stated
 
00:49:15.549 --> 00:49:15.559 align:start position:0%
to the committee and what the
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the former commissioner
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
as well stated to the committee is that
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
it would be better to back down
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the other
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
states and not give Congress cause to
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
preempt in effect the action of New
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the other dozen or more
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
States um defused that energy and
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
Congress in fact never did act so
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
preemption is always possible but was
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
avoided never occurred and the fourth
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
issue which really I've never seen
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
seriously uh put forward uh but it did
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
get raised by uh by one of our
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
presenters is a 14th Amendment equal
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
protection argument and my answer to
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
that is you know good luck with that one
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
that that is in in my personal opinion
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
as a former
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
attorney um has no legs at all um so as
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
as representative ol said uh
 
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
um the courts have recognized that we
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
can make classes and distinctions for
 
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.589 align:start position:0%
can make classes and distinctions for
taxing

00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
taxing
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
purposes the fact is there is no
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination between a us-based
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
multinational and a foreign-based mul
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
multinational any company doing business
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
in multiple States reports as a uni
 
00:50:44.559 --> 00:50:46.109 align:start position:0%
in multiple States reports as a uni
unitary

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
unitary
 
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
entity within the water's edge any
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
Corporation whether the us-based or
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
foreign is allowed to exclude their
 
00:50:53.319 --> 00:50:54.430 align:start position:0%
foreign is allowed to exclude their
foreign

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
activities unless they have a
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
Nexus and of course that Nexus Hook is
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh is not insignificant it means that
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
you could have an entirely foreign
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
corporation that's selling into New
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and therefore has an Nexus so
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
the reach of our law as it
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
is is I think far more
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
extensive than the proponents of this
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
proposal understand and then you start
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
combining that with all the things that
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
have occurred in the in the last within
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
the last 35 40 years um including the
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
taxation of foreign um
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
dividends uh and the guilty and the
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
reduction of the federal corporate tax
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
rate from 35 to
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
21% and and and I think our report will
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
include a list of some of these
 
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.630 align:start position:0%
include a list of some of these
mitigating

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
mitigating
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
developments um the temptation
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
to abuse transfer pricing to shift
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
profits out of New
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is uh has has been
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
substantially mitigated I won't say it's
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
disappeared but um I I can't see it as
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
being a major threat to New Hampshire's
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
revenues and I think the tax Foundation
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
article once
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
again I would read it um I think every
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
member here should take the time to read
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
that it just
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
demolishes the underlying presumptions
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
that allowed for EP to estimate $170
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
million of uh of tax that's uh that's
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
been left on the table so I don't know
 
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
that anybody has a methodology that
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
would allow us to calculate or or
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
estimate what that would be but it
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
certainly is nothing like the 170
 
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.829 align:start position:0%
certainly is nothing like the 170
million

00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:46.839 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm going on um at some length
 
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.430 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm going on um at some length
here

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
because I just think it's extremely
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
important to
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Ju Just A a few
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
questions first um
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
tax there's no additional level within
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
that tax filing that says
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
that you're different than the other one
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying I mean if I'm
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
company a domestic your company B
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
multinational that we're all in the same
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
class when we file our BPT I
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
mean we pay the whatever the tax rate is
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
we we There's no distinction between us
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
correct there is no distinction
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
okay do multi us multinationals through
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
is it Mr Kennedy I think you brought
 
00:54:44.799 --> 00:54:48.589 align:start position:0%
is it Mr Kennedy I think you brought
about

00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
guilty does guilty only apply to US
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
multinationals or Mr Foley okay it it
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
only applies to us shareholders of
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
controlled foreign Corps remember it's a
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
very specific subset uh and I won't go
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
through the whole definition again I I
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
think your intention is does it just hit
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
us businesses and or persons let's not
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
forget humans but yes but but it's only
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
taxed that tax is only applied to
 
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.990 align:start position:0%
taxed that tax is only applied to
us-based

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
us-based
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
multinationals not foreign based
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
multinationals that do business here in
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
this country well no not necessarily I
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
mean if I have what would be referred to
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
as a sandwich structure which is a
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
foreign parent with a US subsidiary that
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
also owns foreign
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
businesses then they're subject to
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
guilty on their subsidiaries activities
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
so it relates to an ownership interest
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
in a foreign court and you can't see
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
instances because I know transfer
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
pricing is so relevant um um where that
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
sandwich structure that foreign cor the
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
US business has no activities with them
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
they're a holding company per say
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
because they wanted to expand X Y and Z
 
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
and that's how they ended up so it's
 
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
always nuanced
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
but uh going back a little bit here to
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
the uh ability of domestic versus
 
00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.150 align:start position:0%
the uh ability of domestic versus
foreign

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.510 align:start position:0%
foreign
multinationals

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
multinationals
 
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh are foreign multinationals that have
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries here in this
 
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.990 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries here in this
state

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
uh are they able to use accounting
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
techniques that uh domestics cannot
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
use to reduce their uh uh operational
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
costs and yeah I I mean whether it
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
reduces or not are there related party
 
00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
transactions is kind of the core of your
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
question um and in general yes sometimes
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
no right I mean I can't speak for All
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
Foreign inbounds um if there are related
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
party transactions the the US tax law
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
says we have to use transfer pricing in
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
the arms length principal Au 42 in the
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
RS there
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
under just highlight that that's
 
00:57:21.029 --> 00:57:21.039 align:start position:0%
important part of our federal um
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
business tax practice is the arms length
 
00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:25.950 align:start position:0%
business tax practice is the arms length
um

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
so that adjustments can be
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
made correct with extensive regulations
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
way U another question I have
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
is I guess it's the the
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
Dr concerning some of the statements
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.799 --> 00:57:55.589 align:start position:0%
 
companies

00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
are there let me let me look at this
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
picture does Water's Edge provision
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
obscure any part of this full picture
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
because companies are not required to
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
account for their operations outside the
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
this I don't know if we can fully answer
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
that question because um what the Dr has
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh has visability of is
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
when the taxpayers failure returns and
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
if complete the file New Hampshire
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
Returns the companying with uh the
 
00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
federal returns submitted to us um and
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
and that's our visibility of course um
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
there there are the uh control for
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
corporations following with the 5471 on
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
we have visibility of that as well um so
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
those that's that's our scope in terms
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
of what we could
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
see I don't know if that answers the
 
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.349 align:start position:0%
see I don't know if that answers the
question

00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
so going back to Mr Chairman's
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh constitutional
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
questions has the state of New Hampshire
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
ever had a decision made on whether the
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional here in as the New
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court ever decided
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
that or is it because of lack of someone
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
going forth
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
to I think that the
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
Constitutional arguments have been
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
Federal right so a a a argument under
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution tends to be heard in
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
a federal court could could have been
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
brought by any of the 50 states or or
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers within those States I haven't
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
read the caterpillar case I don't know
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
precisely what was presented to the New
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court in that case but
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think it had anything to do with
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
any federal constitutional issues well
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh my question is can the state of New
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
BPT divide and say those that are
 
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
domestic will will be
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
treated differently than those that are
 
01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:35.069 align:start position:0%
treated differently than those that are
foreign

01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
multinationals so I I I think the answer
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
is that if circumstances allowed for
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
that kind of a case to be brought and
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
the distinction was truly based on the
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
nature of the
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayer as the
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
distinction as opposed to the nature of
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
the activity
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
that there probably would be a
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem but that's
 
01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
not what has occurred in the history of
 
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
of litigation on this
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
subject and that's why I'm I'm I'm
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
trying to make it very clear that our
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
our law does not discriminate between
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
foreign-based multinationals in US based
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
multinationals it makes no difference
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
where the parent entity is or where it's
 
01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:25.430 align:start position:0%
where the parent entity is or where it's
headquartered

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
headquartered
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
what makes a difference is where the
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
activity is and so as to both those
 
01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
types of
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
entities the activity that's subject to
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
the tax ends at the water's edge it
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a difference whether it's a
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
US multinational with operations in
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
Europe or a European company with
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
operations in the US the question is
 
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
Nexus and your text notes article um
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
presents an interesting uh example of a
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
situation ation with the state of
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
Delaware but any argument or concern
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
that transfer pricing is uh is a problem
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
for tax jurisdictions within the Waters
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
Edge within the 50 states has already
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
been resolved by our our state's
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
decision to use the unitary
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
method and U so everything amongst the
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
50 states is effectively neutralized
 
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.309 align:start position:0%
50 states is effectively neutralized
every

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
outside of the 50 states is beyond reach
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
regardless of where the corporation is
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
based so again I think uh if the
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
distinction was the nature of the entity
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
you might have a constitutional issue if
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
the issue is the difference in in the
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
nature of the activity you
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
don't representa
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
doy thank you Mr chair um just refresh
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
my memory a little bit here if you're
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
doing business in New Hampshire you need
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
to be registered as a New Hampshire
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
business that's
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
correct so any entity that is registered
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
as a New Hampshire business is taxed as
 
01:03:13.269 --> 01:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
business regardless of the size or their
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
tentacles if you will or their
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
International relationships but they're
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
taxed on what they do
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire be it a uh
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
Joe's pool room or it's no no longer
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
Boston bards what's it called I forget
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
but uh whether it's that type of an
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
operation or if
 
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
it's um flare for example which sells
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
all over the out of Nashville which
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
sells all over the
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
place um there're still taxed the same
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
because of what um the chair just said
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the type of business that
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're engaged in what they're doing is
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
they're selling this product from New
 
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I if I'm not mistaken that
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
was one of the ground uh um foundations
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
even for the Wayfair decision and it
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
didn't make any difference where the
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
product was
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
manufactured but it was where it was
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
sold so that the activity in New
 
01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is being taxed in New
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where the activity elsewhere
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
is somebody else's
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
problem yeah that's that's accurate of
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
course we have just moved away from a
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
three Factor um to a single sales Factor
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
so it's now uh under our new law a
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
question of you know the sales activity
 
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
that our use of the unitary filing
 
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
differs from the US from the federal
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
government which still operates under
 
01:04:57.559 --> 01:04:59.269 align:start position:0%
government which still operates under
separate

01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:04:59.279 --> 01:05:01.789 align:start position:0%
separate
filing

01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
filing
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
however our limitation of the unitary
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
filing at the water's
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
edge allows for corporations filing tax
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
returns in New Hampshire to align what
 
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
they're reporting with what they report
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
to the federal government because the
 
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
water's edge coincides with the United
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
States the 50 states
 
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
a tax filing to the
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
IRS is comprehensive of all activity
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
within the 50
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
states New Hampshire's use of unitary
 
01:05:41.069 --> 01:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
filing but limited to the waterers Edge
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
coincides with what the federal
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
government is looking
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
at so to go back to Senator Murphy's
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
comments I think one of the greatest
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
flaws in this concept accept this
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
proposal is that it basically asks the
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire with 34% of the
 
01:06:03.799 --> 01:06:04.950 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire with 34% of the
national

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
national
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
population to fight a battle that none
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the other 49 states is willing to
 
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
fight and the federal government is not
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
fight to adopt it means we would take so
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
seriously the notion that transfer
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
pricing is being abused that we're
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
motivated to require taxpayers to report
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
to New
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what the IRS doesn't re
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
require them to
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
report that monumentally changes the
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
task for the tasks payer to um conform
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
and and to file it monumentally
 
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
changes the um the challenge for the
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
Dr to monitor to audit and
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
enforce so we would
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
lose a lot of the benefit that we
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
currently enjoy in New Hampshire where
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
the tax return filed by a company with
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
the IRS is the starting point for the
 
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's it's actually the more
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
you think about it it would be a pretty
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.789 align:start position:0%
 
own

01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
well Mr chairman yes representative
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
shamber I uh go back to
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
a statement that we tax only the
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
activity that's here what we
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
tax is upon the reported
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
profits that they earn not the
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
activity and if you're
 
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.510 align:start position:0%
able to
reduce

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:02.839 align:start position:0%
your uh reported profits by some methods
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
class we start to see an unlevel field
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
starting to develop here or has already
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
been there um transparency is very
 
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.470 align:start position:0%
been there um transparency is very
important

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
and uh as I stated with the Senate Bill
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
638 on the reporting of country by
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
country that transparency is now
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
starting to dissolve a little bit and I
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
think as we go along we're going to see
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
more and more information come
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
out about
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
how companies
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
operate uh in what they're reporting the
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
data you cannot get from the uh internal
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue Service but you can get it from
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
the SEC and I think there'll be some
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
comparisons of what is being reported to
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government and what is
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
reported here uh in New Hampshire I'd
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
like to bring up one other point can I
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
just specifically on that one all right
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
no no specifically on that one yes
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
if if s 638 which you have cited I don't
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
know what the statute number is
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
um if that's just been implemented by
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
the US Congress for the purpose of
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
information gathering and Analysis it's
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
going to take them a number of years to
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
get a track record that they can
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
actually work with and
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
analyze doesn't it behoove the state of
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to let the federal
 
01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
government explore that very very
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
intricate topic and uh wait to see what
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
they find out and what they decide to do
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
well it would behoove us but there are
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
certain legislative functions that occur
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
in this state that when we asked slow
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
down let us do some research like single
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
sales Factor it was just
 
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
ignored uh this Ways and Means Committee
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
did ask for that slowdown approach and
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
it was ignored so uh I I I didn't have
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
the privilege of being in the
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
legislature at the time but I imagine I
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
would have been right there with you on
 
01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.270 align:start position:0%
would have been right there with you on
that

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
point uh the one thing I'd like to just
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
bring up before we go any further um
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
even though something has been a law a
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
tax policy for
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
30 s years I got my math
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
right 202 37
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
years the case of Smith versus the
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
Dr uh had to do with a law that was in
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
effect for 70 years on interstate
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
commerce and it was found that that law
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire had
 
01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
was counter to what interstate commerce
 
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
was and it had to do with the gentleman
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
being taxed
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
differently in the state of New
 
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.270 align:start position:0%
differently in the state of New
Hampshire

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
versus where he was filing certain
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork and I'm just trying to just
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
sort of say just because something has
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
been there for a period of time does not
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
mean that that it couldn't
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
become an issue for this state I would
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
hate to see us the money that the person
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
received was
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
undisclosed it was in the the millions
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
but it was undisclosed I would hate to
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
see us step to some
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
place and
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
say we are not to be worried about this
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
I think we should be a little bit
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about the distinctions that we
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
have applied to
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
our BPT class of domestics and
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
multinationals foreign multinationals
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
out here that they are being treated
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
differently within the BPT class not
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
that they're paying the same tax rate
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
to reduce its tax liability to this
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
not

01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
so I I would agree that the mere passage
 
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
of time alone is no reason to revisit an
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
issue that was wrongly decided or um you
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
know the circumstances have
 
01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.390 align:start position:0%
know the circumstances have
changed

01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
and my argument that we not go forward
 
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
with this proposal has nothing to do
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
with the fact that it's been 36 years
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
but if you go back and
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
you revisit and understand what motive
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
ated the law in 81 and what motivated
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
86 you're going to find that the reasons
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
still stand
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
today and the state was resolving a
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
problem that we would be stepping back
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
okay this is this this is the kind of
 
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
cqu I was hoping for I mean you know
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
this this is a real debate um so before
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
we go on to uh Mr Foley Mr Kennedy is
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
there anything further does anybody want
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
to ask further questions of
 
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.550 align:start position:0%
to ask further questions of
Representative

01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
shamberg he'll wait till we're in
 
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee well much of it will be
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
addressed in the final
 
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
report so I'm going to turn this over to
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
our two resident uh CPA
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
experts um so happily I think our report
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
will be largely anticlimactic because
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything within our
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
neutral report has already been
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
discussed uh you may recall uh at our
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
last meeting I had asked if we could
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
kind of go through the bullet points of
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
all of the issues that we discussed and
 
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
our report largely just took those
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
bullet points and added some level of
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
narrative to them um uh I'll pass this
 
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
out now and then I think I only need to
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
briefly touch base on a couple of things
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
because most everything in this is
 
01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
largely what has been discussed already
 
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
or presented here at this meeting and I
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
so so as uh Mr Foley is passing these
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
out I I'll just hit on the the overall
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
organization it is largely again an
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
expansion of the bullet points that we
 
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
uh had discussed at the end of last
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
meeting um and it's organized generally
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
as follow uh first section is just
 
01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
generally accepted
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
considerations um the second section is
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
potentially mitigating factors which the
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
chair had asked us to incorporate which
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
he had already uh mentioned and then uh
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
the third item is just outlining the uh
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
items that both support and are against
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh moving to worldwide reporting uh
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
again pretty much all of these have been
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
discussed uh and or and or expanded on
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the generally accepted
 
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
considerations uh again that
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
constitutionality moving to worldwide
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
reporting should be allowed um transfer
 
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.470 align:start position:0%
reporting should be allowed um transfer
pricing

01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
exists um uh however the um extent uh to
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
which transfer pricing um may move uh
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
profits out of New Hampshire is not
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
completely known uh New Hampshire taxes
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
foreign income already to some degree
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
including uh by the receipt of foreign
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
dividends and by um other um uh
 
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
anti-avoidance Provisions in the IRS
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
code including subp partf income and
 
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.310 align:start position:0%
code including subp partf income and
guilty

01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
guilty
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
income uh transfer pricing May create an
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
uneven playing field or inequity between
 
01:16:23.629 --> 01:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
companies that have or do not have
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh foreign related entities um and that
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
currently because of numerous factors um
 
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
there's simply not a lot of information
 
01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:33.750 align:start position:0%
there's simply not a lot of information
to

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
quantify um uh how Revenue may be being
 
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
or profit may be being shifted out um
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
partly just limitations that exist for
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
the Dr and also partly because um the
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
guilty uh taxation is fairly new uh to
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the mitigating factors uh
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
were discussed which is that there have
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
been uh various uh changes in uh since
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
2017 with the tax cut and jobs act
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
including guilty the repatriation Act
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
and the reduced corporate tax rate which
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
may mitigate some of the factors with
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
the transf potential transfer pricing
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
issue and in terms of items of support
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
and against again it's been largely
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
expanded on um the most notable item of
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
support is the theory that um this would
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
level the playing field for entities
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
that uh are only domestic and those that
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
have foreign related uh entities and
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
against um would be that New Hampshire
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
would be an outliner relative to moving
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
to worldwide reporting um what wasn't
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned and um uh was this um
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
potential and the word that was
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
presented was retaliation I don't quite
 
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
remember who the presenter was of
 
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
foreign companies uh foreign countries
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
if we move to worldwide
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
reporting um um the and then of course
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
the increase in administration and
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
compliance burden for the New Hampshire
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
Dr for tax payers and businesses and for
 
01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.189 align:start position:0%
Dr for tax payers and businesses and for
tax

01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
practitioners um and lastly um which was
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
not mentioned um that I can recall in
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
this today's meeting is that there may
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
be alternatives to address uh the
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing issue um whereas um um
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does tax guilty but it's
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
only at 50%
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
U potentially there are other means that
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
could be looked at relative to instead
 
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
of moving to worldwide reporting but to
 
01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
address the uh transfer pricing
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
potential transfer pricing issue so
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
again rather anti-climatic at this point
 
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
um but um I think I'll next time I'll
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
ask to start and uh then then we've set
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
the foundation so uh so again I don't
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
know if there's anything that would have
 
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
been very wise chairman only
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
hadling so um uh so that that largely is
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
it uh I expect um uh Mr F and I will
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
expand on the narrative as this is
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
mostly in bullet form but uh again this
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
is largely intended just to outline and
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
to add some narrative to the discussions
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
we've all had both for and
 
01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
against sorry Matt do you have anything
 
01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:20.629 align:start position:0%
against sorry Matt do you have anything
to

01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
add well thank you very much
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
I what's particularly helpful about this
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
is that it's designed to sort of harvest
 
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
the arguments and catalog the arguments
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
on both sides and not to deny the
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
premise of the um
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
Advocates uh so I think that uh you know
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves in a situation where
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
we do understand how transfer pricing
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
can be used uh we understand that it may
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
have consequences and it may be abused
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
even though it's a perfectly normal and
 
01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.550 align:start position:0%
even though it's a perfectly normal and
absolutely

01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
necessary uh technique between
 
01:20:00.199 --> 01:20:01.430 align:start position:0%
necessary uh technique between
Affiliated

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
Affiliated
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
entities we have no way of quantifying
 
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
uncertainty representative
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
Val you used a term there and necessary
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
practice and I I had failed to include
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
that in my comments but yes uh we
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
probably need to elaborate on the fact
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
that it is a NE it is necessary to take
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
monies from here to give it to there so
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
you can get this so you can get that so
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
that you can get your product done and
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
get it to Sales get it to Market yes yes
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
I I I think that's probably worth
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
stating um transfer pricing should not
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
be understood to be inherently
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
negative transfer pricing is a necessary
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
way of sharing expenses across
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
Affiliated entities where an investment
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
is made in one entity that's then
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
realized in another so the question is
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
how would we ever set up a regime that
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
um that discerns it and in fact I think
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's a very interesting point that the
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
unitary worldwide reporting actually
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any effort to identify
 
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
where the abuses use of transfer pricing
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
is it's it's if we adopted this scheme
 
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't Aid Us in identifying or
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
isolating or correcting it's just a very
 
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
broad crude way of sort of saying well
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
if we all just pull it back together
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
again uh then more or less everything
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
will come out in the
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
wash treating the issue in that way
 
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
should be understood as is an
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment that we have no way of
 
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
identifying and isolating and correcting
 
01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.110 align:start position:0%
identifying and isolating and correcting
specific

01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
abuses and I think that
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
um again uh the tax Foundation article I
 
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:13.639 align:start position:0%
just think is so important to read
 
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
Because what it illustrates is that we
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
have to use certain
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
devices to get our arms around something
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's inherently unknown and you know
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
even with the audit uh powers that the
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
state has we have a limited ability to
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
get so far inside the books of a
 
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer uh you know to know that they
 
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
have been actually totally compliant on
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
a transactions by transactions basis so
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
we use a series of devices and U unitary
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
reporting coupled with formulary
 
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
allocation is just that it's a device
 
01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
and the question of uh single sales
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
Factor versus the three factor and uh
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
and and the various other questions that
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
come up are all about how we shape that
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
device at the end of the
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
day even if this was
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
implemented what we're talking about is
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
instructing the corporations to make a
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
different mathematical
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
calculation and it's a calculation in
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
which the base of taxable activity gets
 
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
expanded potentially drastically so that
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
the denominator of the math equation
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
becomes vastly
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
larger but the calculation still has to
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
assign a certain
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
percentage to their activity with a New
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nexus and the result is that
 
01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.470 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nexus and the result is that
the

01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
numerator becomes correspondingly
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
watered down to the point where they're
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
making a calculation theoretically on
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know worldwide income where only an
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
infantes little percentage of it is
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
subcribed to New Hampshire um I'm not
 
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
sure we really get anywhere and I think
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
that we've we've read plenty of examples
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
where we can see that uh corporations
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
some corporations will be winners some
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
corporations will be losers and I think
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Al's uh Shipyard
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
examples were good illustrations of how
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
that can change from year to year and
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
and affiliate to
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
affiliate why do we want to make the
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
determination of New Hampshire's
 
01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
business tax depend on the vicissitudes
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
of profit and loss in foreign places I
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't see that it makes things better I
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
worse if I may uh of course you may I
 
01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
can see why you spoke so so well in
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
front of the US Supreme Court all right
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
oh believe me I didn't have the oral
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
argument oh all right all right
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh my
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
background and my personal makeup is
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
that when
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
I first let me say this of all our tax
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
policies of all our taxes we have there
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
are people that don't like tax
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
rates or like taxes but we
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
we can argue those points but but when I
 
01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
distinctly different in in how it
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
approaches that that class of
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
individuals the class of
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh I will I will stand up I I
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
just and say this is not right and
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
domestic businesses companies in this
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
state are treated differently than those
 
01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
that have the capability of using
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
accounting methods that
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh our locals can't use
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
and I hope
 
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
that individuals and taxpayers
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
understand we encourage we want business
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
here but we want to treat everybody
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
equally because if you don't treat
 
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
everybody equally and someone starts
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
getting a
 
01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
benefit there is going to be others on
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
the other side go wait a minute what's
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
going on here and our reputation as a
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
state becomes affected so I'm just
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
letting you know where I'm coming from
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
on this it's nothing personal against
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
any business it is let's have a Level
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
Playing Field thank you um you're you're
 
01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.550 align:start position:0%
Playing Field thank you um you're you're
illustrating

01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
illustrating
 
01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.430 align:start position:0%
illustrating
a

01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
challenge um that we're going to face in
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
writing this
 
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
report and and that is that
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
um I fundamentally disagree that our law
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
treats different classes of taxpayers
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
differently it is inherently true that a
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
company operating entirely within New
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't have Affiliates in
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
other states let alone in other
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
countries it's inherently true that a
 
01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
business that doesn't have Affiliates is
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
not in a position to use transfer
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
pricing that has that is not a product
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
of our law that's a product of their
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances in organization our law is
 
01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
neutral I it's a very important point
 
01:27:49.149 --> 01:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
and and as I say I'm I'm going to be
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
taking pains to try to explain expl that
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
Valerie covered the base
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
well yeah and there still hasn't been a
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
clear definition as to how they're SE
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
treated differently just because one has
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
as you just indicated is a larger entity
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
having an ability it's grown it has now
 
01:28:19.109 --> 01:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
for example there a law firm in
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester that was man that was New
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only now has got an office in
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
Brazil and it's got an office in
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
London they they grow businesses grow
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
and now they can take advantage of a
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
bunch of other
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
activities merely because of the size of
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
their operation even though the same
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
basic laws within New Hampshire apply
 
01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
period thank you for that I yeah it's an
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
interesting nothing static um
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
corporations reorganize merge uh grow
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
open up new units it's very hard to say
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
how a particular taxpayer that's
 
01:28:58.510 --> 01:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
affected in a certain way today might be
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
affected in 10
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
years I still say that it's giving a tax
 
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.070 align:start position:0%
years I still say that it's giving a tax
advantage

01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:29:12.109 --> 01:29:12.119 align:start position:0%
to a group in a
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
class has nothing to do with how they go
 
01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
about their operation or their business
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
it is still a tax advantage let me POS a
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
question oh
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer makes a major capital
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
investment and they then Avail
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
themselves of the allowances for
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
depreciation and they thereby gain a tax
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
advantage by being able to offset some
 
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
of their income with their annual
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
depreciation allowance whether we're
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
talking about threee fiveyear equipment
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
40-year commercial real estate
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
isn't that really analogous to what
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.229 --> 01:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
of if the other
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
companies can do the same
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
thing in approaching how
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
they invest or take advantage of their
 
01:30:18.719 --> 01:30:20.229 align:start position:0%
they invest or take advantage of their
uh

01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
depreciations uh I would say yes
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
but I don't see domestics being able to
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
take advantage the same advantage that
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
foreign multinationals or can take when
 
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
it comes
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
reporting of their business profits tax
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
that they have devices and uh uh
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
accounting that that can't be used by
 
01:30:51.149 --> 01:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
the domestic companies so certain
 
01:30:51.159 --> 01:30:53.270 align:start position:0%
the domestic companies so certain
businesses

01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
um are inherently Capital intensive
 
01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
right um let's say a ski area is
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
particularly Capital intensive because
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
it has the fixed initial investment of
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing its side of the mountain has
 
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
to have a chunk of real estate it's
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
going to depreciate it uh or a company
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
That's Heavy in u u manufacturing
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
equipment uh may have leased facilities
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
but still may have major Capital
 
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
expenses in the heavy
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
machinery it's just a question of using
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
the tax laws for the circumstances of
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
that particular tax Filer and um I I I I
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
simply fail to see how any company in
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire couldn't start doing
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
business in another state I can't see
 
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
how any business in New Hampshire could
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
not uh organize an Affiliated corporate
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
entity or have subsidiaries all of these
 
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
choices are available it's a question of
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
the needs of the
 
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
company but when they incorporate like
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
that in other states using a subsidiary
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
they still under Water's Edge there are
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
certain restrictions that they have that
 
01:32:07.199 --> 01:32:09.229 align:start position:0%
certain restrictions that they have that
foreign

01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
multinationals do not have in how they
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
file and how they use
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
uh the tax system as we as we developed
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
it so I think I'm I'm struggling to get
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
you to see a different
 
01:32:29.109 --> 01:32:29.119 align:start position:0%
delineation um that's why my report's
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
going to be different than yours well
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
um the water's edge applies
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
to the unitary requirement limited by
 
01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
the water's edge applies to any company
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
whether they're foreign or domestic that
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
does businesses in more than one
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
the limitation of the wat's edge applies
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
equally to any business that's doing
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
business in the United States or abroad
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
and it's not limited to foreign
 
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
multinationals it's any
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
multinational so the distinctions you're
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
valid I have to think about that we're
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
all going to
 
01:33:25.109 --> 01:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
okay this is going to be a very tough
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
report to write that's why I began by
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
apologizing for not having a draft in
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
today um what more would we like to
 
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
accomplish this
 
01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.910 align:start position:0%
accomplish this
morning

01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
and do we believe we need to meet again
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking probably yes but I'm
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
theoretically we could wrap up our
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
business uh you know uh
 
01:33:52.830 --> 01:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
virtually but uh we have a tight
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
timeline it's November
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
1st I've personally held open the next
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
two Mondays just in case I would like to
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
think that if we meet again we can
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
probably have drafts in front of us and
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
wrap it up in one meeting but having
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
23d I will not be in state on the 23rd
 
01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
okay 30th is
 
01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
neither either oh either okay excellent
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
um if we have drafts circulated that we
 
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
can work on and meet on Monday
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
morning October 30th 10: a.m. here we
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
would then have uh two days to the close
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
of business on Wednesday the 1st to file
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
our report can we make that work I think
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
the real onuses on on me I think
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg you've you've
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
done good work in putting your advocacy
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
piece in and I probably will send a
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
revised report now sure absolutely feel
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
free okay and uh Mr Kennedy Mr fo you're
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
going to flesh your section out a little
 
01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
bit more and we may want to go back and
 
01:35:13.629 --> 01:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
forth a little bit in terms of seeing
 
01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
how that folds into the the bigger
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
report yeah I I had presumed that our
 
01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
report would be mostly to the committee
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
and not
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
be presented outside of the committee
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
but incorporated into the final report I
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
presume that's still a
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
plan yes yes what you're doing is
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
helping towards the draft of the
 
01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.669 align:start position:0%
helping towards the draft of the
commission's

01:35:38.669 --> 01:35:38.679 align:start position:0%
commission's
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
report and as you've seen from the uh
 
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
template that Gen 4 prepared for us
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
um our report will be transmitted to the
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
speaker the president of the Senate
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
House and Senate clerks the governor and
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
the state librarian under a cover Memo
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
from me uh and we'll come jointly from
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
us so I'm clear on the date we talk
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
Monday the 30th or Tuesday the 31st
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
Monday the 30th all right I I do have a
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
conflict at that time but it may be the
 
01:36:20.189 --> 01:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
only time is there a different hour um
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
it's large in all day
 
01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
events May I make a suggestion yes the
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
23rd was good for the rest of you except
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
me correct and you're going to be
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
putting yours together why not meet on
 
01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.590 align:start position:0%
putting yours together why not meet on
the

01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
23rd if you
 
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
wish and then on the 30th we'll have my
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
then need
 
01:36:53.550 --> 01:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
yes everyone needs to be here I think
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
six is a
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
call think we have 12 MERS so
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I am advised
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
fortunately I have a good
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
advisor that uh we need to have all
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
seven of us present in order to have a
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
quorum to conduct business so we it is
 
01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
important that we pick a day and a time
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
everybody

01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
seven let me ask let me ask this Jen
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
would we need all seven here just for
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
the work
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
session without a decision being made
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
and then the 30th come back in and have
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
news the statute that authorizes Us in
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
section four includes this sentence six
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
members of the commission shall
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:28.239 --> 01:38:29.870 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
well so um what do we think about
 
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg's idea that we
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
get together next Monday even though he
 
01:38:39.629 --> 01:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
won't be able to be with us I think it's
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
a good
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
idea I think it would be a good idea for
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
word smithing and the incorporation of
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
the uh uh CPA uh section so that they
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
know exactly how what going going to fit
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
in and then we can just in include uh on
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
the the next Monday uh their section we
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
between the two of us and include uh
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative sham Berg's uh um counter
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
proposal and B I think that's that's
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
valuable it gives us nine days to then
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
pull it together it also let's be frank
 
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
fire you've turned the heat on in your
 
01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:25.310 align:start position:0%
fire you've turned the heat on in your
house

01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
