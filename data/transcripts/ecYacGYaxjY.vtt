anyone
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
trying to remember who he was this
 
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
should be listed
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
who he was
 
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
relating to

and
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
you can see how important this is to me
 
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
because i've already forgotten i think
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
he's something like an executive
 
00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
director or some kind of a director
 
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing nodding executive director
 
00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
of nashua children's home
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
he also
 
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
says here um
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
contrasted the report that was presented
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
and the credentialing report and if
 
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
somebody could supply a sentence as to
 
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
what he said
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
he said they were different
 
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
mr chair i i i just remember that he
 
00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
took issue with the official report and
 
00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.710 align:start position:0%
took issue with the official report and
he

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
he thought it was
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
incomplete or
 
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
may have been an error in some of their
 
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the facts
 
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.030 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the facts
okay

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't i wish i remembered more
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
than that but again two busy months
 
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.589 align:start position:0%
than that but again two busy months
understood

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
are we using mics today yeah i am
 
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
sorry um the executive director brought
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh forward the
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
the point that
 
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
the child advocates uh
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
report was very different than the
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
credentialing report that they had just
 
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
received from their national
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
accreditation body
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
child advocate report was done off-site
 
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
and that the credentialing report
 
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.749 align:start position:0%
and that the credentialing report
actually

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
required that a team of people went in
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
into the facility to to observe and
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
interview the uh the kids and the staff
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
at the facility so
 
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that he was uh just
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
comparing the differences between those
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want to have an oversight in
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.390 align:start position:0%
a minute
um

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
also bob keating
 
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.830 align:start position:0%
also bob keating
um

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
this question raised as to whether he
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
was a is a former staff member
 
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.749 align:start position:0%
was a is a former staff member
uh

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
i keep calling you representative
 
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
um for the record john williams the
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
director of legislative affairs for the
 
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
department of health and services and it
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
was brought to my attention to provide
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
to the committee through mr villardi uh
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
that the mr keaton uh introduced himself
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
as a former staff member so if at a
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
minimum i think the the minutes that he
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
would be suggesting at least to bring to
 
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
your attention would be to after mr
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
keating's name to add introduced as a
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
former staff member uh it was
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
represented that he's actually a
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
contractor and not an employee of the
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
children's home
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
an independent contractor hired thank
 
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.469 align:start position:0%
an independent contractor hired thank
you

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
do we have names
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
more names from megan and stacy these
 
00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:25.430 align:start position:0%
more names from megan and stacy these
were

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.790 align:start position:0%
were
free

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
anything else that we should probably
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
add to this because if we spent quite a
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
bit of time on it and
 
00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.590 align:start position:0%
bit of time on it and
uh

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
this the minutes are not in uh are not
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
incorrect saying mariah o'neil is the
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
child advocate it's just that her
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
replacement has now been hired
 
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.250 align:start position:0%
replacement has now been hired
um

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.870 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee that they
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
would like answer about any area of the
 
00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.909 align:start position:0%
would like answer about any area of the
department

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.050 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
[Music]

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
we you and i had a sidebar conversation
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
maybe six months ago and you had made a
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
comment that you were considering
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
conducting an after-action review on the
 
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.949 align:start position:0%
conducting an after-action review on the
departmental

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
departmental
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
department's handling of the whole covid
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
crisis putting on
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
sure so the after action review is
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
actually being led by the department of
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
safety homeland security their rfp for
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
that service there's going to be a third
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
party that that's going to do it that
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
they will award that that uh contract in
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
the coming weeks and then it will begin
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
i do believe it will be a long process
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
probably greater than a year there were
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
different phases of our response you
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
know the first being the ppe and the
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
immediate and then other phases after
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
that um and so so
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
they will go through those phases
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of requirements for
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
in-person interviews for unified command
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
and the leadership team many of those
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
people unified command the people that
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
were the three people that were in
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
unified command two of the three me
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
being the third the other two have
 
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.550 align:start position:0%
being the third the other two have
retired

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
retired
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
and are no longer working in those areas
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
so they will have to go out and find
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions now before we hear
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
the report
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
yes senator
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning commissioner good
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
morning are there places in the state
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
and where
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
that people can still get free pcr tests
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes um the pharmacies being
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
a big one your pcp office um
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
but the pharmacies being the the big one
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
that that's doing a lot still doing a
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
lot of testing so either it is covered
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
through um your health insurance or it's
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
covered through hersa
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
follow up so
 
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
follow up so
but

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
if it recovered through your health
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
insurance it probably wouldn't be free
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
right you don't have a copay there's no
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
copay for it not that's true if you went
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
to your physician as well you wouldn't
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
it depends on if you're just going for
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
the test itself or if you're going for
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
an appointment so if you go for an
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
appointment because you have a
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
respiratory illness and the physician
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
does a test and the evaluation then
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a copay for that
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
visit okay many hospitals have just
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
drive through clinics and if you call
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
your pcp office and ask for a covet test
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
you may be referred to the drive-through
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
clinic in that case you will not have a
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
a co-pay for that service and the
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
pharmacies that's true as well yes thank
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
you yep
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman commissioner nice
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
to see you again um i just want to point
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
out for the committee that at our last
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
meeting in january
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
you uh presaged what the head of the cdc
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
dr welinski told us last week which is
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
that the data system that we're getting
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
out of cdc is not very useful
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
you were quite accurate in that regard
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
do we have anything in place to deal
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
with a potential surge in the ba2
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
variant i believe we're looking at about
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
10 percent um
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
prevalence here in new hampshire
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
currently and seasonal influenza
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
yes so so we are we do have funds set
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
aside for the fall specifically october
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
through march we expect that we're going
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
to see a surge in covid
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
during normal influenza a normal
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
respiratory illness season so we do have
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
our money set aside to be able to stand
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
up services again if needed um the the
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
game changer is the antiviral that's on
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
the market right now and uh
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're readily available at pharmacies
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
across the state so the hope is that
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
even if the ba2 variant increases the
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of cases in in new hampshire
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a very early
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
treatment that you can take at home
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
without needing to engage the health
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
care system
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
with the exception of your pcp but yes
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
we do have the funding and the plan
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
available to stand up uh
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
a vaccine clinic if needed but our our
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
hope is that the health care system will
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
children ages six months through four
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
years and if there is an additional
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
booster that comes this fall
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
that will be as far as we know right now
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
only for the elderly and
 
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.710 align:start position:0%
only for the elderly and
immunocompromised

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
that will also be handled by the health
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
care system if something happens that
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
the surge is larger than we expect we
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
always have the ability to stand up
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
state testing state vaccine
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
national guard assistance things like
 
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.710 align:start position:0%
national guard assistance things like
that

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%

and uh ultimately
 
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:33.190 align:start position:0%
and uh ultimately
uh

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
who in the executive department i mean
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
other than the governor uh who is
 
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.629 align:start position:0%
other than the governor uh who is
accountable

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
for uh developing the plan and executing
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
the plan for that campus is it the tag
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
is it dhhs is it who's ultimately
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
responsible it's not dhhs
 
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.269 align:start position:0%
responsible it's not dhhs
it's

00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's the tag
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
my team my team tells me
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
just so this is just a comment i i don't
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
know if long term that's the right
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
organizational structure i don't know
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
what the right organizational structure
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
is but i i hope there's further
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
are you prepared to give reasons why you
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
think others might be
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
the better choice
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i just in general
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
the array of services that are going to
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
be provided through there
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
to include
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
addressing homelessness addressing some
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a retreat environment
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
to i assume primarily for ptsd folks
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's probably you know
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to be some vocational
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
training in there there's it's it's such
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
a wide array of services
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
wonder aloud if the tag who's
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for keeping our national
 
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.629 align:start position:0%
responsible for keeping our national
guard

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
guard
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
deployable for war
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
should be spending
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
so much time focused on kind of a
 
00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.389 align:start position:0%
so much time focused on kind of a
caregiving

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
caregiving
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
set of responsibilities
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
the the department routinely
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
collaborates with veterans affairs and
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
tag on any type of mental health health
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
care homelessness we have programs
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
throughout the department where there is
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
a collaboration so i'm not concerned at
 
00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.750 align:start position:0%
a collaboration so i'm not concerned at
all

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
that even if the tag is leading the
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
project that we will be involved either
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
through mou or through service provider
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
through our contracts
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
but they are leading the project project
 
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
but you're right with all of the health
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
care needs of the people that are
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
involved i do expect dhhs or our service
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
my question is to see if there is at
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
this point an update which there may not
 
00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:55.110 align:start position:0%
this point an update which there may not
be

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
but anything further to report on
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
payment in lieu of taxes for hampstead
 
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.910 align:start position:0%
payment in lieu of taxes for hampstead
hospital

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
i don't see melissa here i can tell you
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
we had our meeting with
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
the town and we settled on a number we
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
settled on a one-year contract so we can
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
update it in 12 months to see what the
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
impact of the hospital will be on the
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
town um i have not seen the mou come
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
forward to governor and council so it's
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
either it's somewhere in that pipeline
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'll have to check it out i was supposed
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
to be at that meeting and did not get an
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
invitation so thank you
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes senator thank you
 
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.269 align:start position:0%
yes senator thank you
um

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
could you give us an update on the
 
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.710 align:start position:0%
could you give us an update on the
status

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
of negotiations with cms on maybe that
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
clawback penalty payment
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
idn waiver
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
we had a well not we henry lipman our
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
medicaid director had a meeting with cms
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
leadership approximately two or three
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
they were going to meet internally and
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
then come back to us
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
with another meeting date to have the
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
discussion i think that there is very
 
00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:06.069 align:start position:0%
discussion i think that there is very
much

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
a understanding that
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
what what resulted in a lack of budget
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
neutrality in the state under around the
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
11 15 waiver number one the waiver
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
itself there was a flawed design in the
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
very early stages of it and number two
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of the the issues that resulted in
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
a lack of budget neutrality were outside
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
of our control mainly being the opioid
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
epidemic um you know we we went into
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
crisis in this state probably one of the
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
worst in our country and then covet uh
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
so both of those played into the our the
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
inability to to get to budget neutrality
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
and uh they they definitely they're
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
definitely showing an understanding for
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
that we asked uh
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
well over a year ago
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually before i became commissioner so
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's well over two years ago to adjust
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
the budget neutrality
 
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.310 align:start position:0%
the budget neutrality
assumptions

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
assumptions
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
based on the waiver and
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
those conversations are still happening
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
two years later and we asked for
 
00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:13.270 align:start position:0%
two years later and we asked for
clarification

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
um back under commissioner myers and the
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic just put everything on hold so
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
we're back at the negotiating table we
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
what the outcome is going to be at this
 
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.150 align:start position:0%
what the outcome is going to be at this
point

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
now behavioral health strategy and
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
10-year mental health plan progress
 
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.750 align:start position:0%
10-year mental health plan progress
update

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
update
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
i believe it looks like this of all the
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to make some
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
introductory remarks and then i'm going
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
to hand it over to kacha unfortunately
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to leave after this
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
presentation to attend another meeting
 
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.190 align:start position:0%
presentation to attend another meeting
so

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
so
the

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral health work in new hampshire
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
most of you know that it's been
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's been 10 years in the in the making
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
we've had an er boarding list for at
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
least 10 years i think we're probably at
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
11 at this point at this point
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
we've had a strategy for the past number
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
of years on correcting this system and
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
you've seen that this work being done
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
first through the 10-year mental health
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
plan which
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
many of our legislators were involved in
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
second was really taking a hard look at
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital and how they
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
operated and i spent
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
almost three years there trying to
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
create operationally efficient systems
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
and in that time frame we saw our wait
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
list drop by about 50 percent
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
once those two things were done and even
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
when i was at the hospital several
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
legislators and several committees asked
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
me do we need more inpatient beds and i
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
was very direct in my answer to that to
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
say i don't know because at that point i
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
did not know if we needed more inpatient
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
beds because i was still in the process
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
of trying to move new hampshire hospital
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
in a way to be more operationally
 
00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:03.590 align:start position:0%
in a way to be more operationally
efficient

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
so now
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
fast forward about four or five years
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
later i do know that we that we do need
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
more inpatient beds and i think we need
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know very strategic in how we do
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we started off with prevention
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
programs and koch is going to outline
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
the prevention programs that that we did
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
in building up our capacity to to do
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
prevention then we went to
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
community-based programs and we built up
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
that capacity next was crisis-based
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
programs which you saw a statewide
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis rapid response
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then you come to the most expensive
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
in the smallest part of our system which
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
is your inpatient capacity once we've
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
built out
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
the other three tiers
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
what is left is inpatient so this past
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
year and actually over the last two
 
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.909 align:start position:0%
year and actually over the last two
years

00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
what you will see is is in an investment
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the inpatient capacity i truly
 
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.390 align:start position:0%
in the inpatient capacity i truly
believe

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
that people should be able to receive
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
care in their communities i don't
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
believe that people should need to
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
travel to one hospital in this state
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
have no choice on where they receive
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
their care i believe that everybody
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
should have a choice so
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
we started with hampstead
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
making sure that we
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
invested in children's behavioral health
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
services in
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
inpatient care you will see an expansion
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
of prtf which is psychiatric residential
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
treatment facility for kids once we own
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
that building
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
and it really solidifies our investment
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
for children
 
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.149 align:start position:0%
for children
for

00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
the long term
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
we started building the forensic
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
hospital so the plans are done we expect
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
to break ground next year it's 24 beds
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
much less than what what we asked for
 
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.630 align:start position:0%
much less than what what we asked for
but

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
the building is being built that if we
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
need to add on in the future we can
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
what that will do is take 24 civilly
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
committed patients out of spu at the
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
state prison and bring them into a
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
clinical environment at new hampshire
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
hospital we expect that to be done in
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
about two years
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
two additional investments that we're
 
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.350 align:start position:0%
two additional investments that we're
making

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
one which is very well known is the hca
 
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.430 align:start position:0%
one which is very well known is the hca
investment

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
investment
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
we're asking for 15 million dollars to
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
invest in a new psychiatric consolidated
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital in epping new
 
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.510 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital in epping new
hampshire

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
as a capital defragment
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
for a commitment period of 10 years
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
what this 15 million buys us is about 40
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
new inpatient beds and some leverage
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
that we prioritize new hampshire
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
residents that we
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
we can ask for a certain percentage of
 
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.110 align:start position:0%
we can ask for a certain percentage of
medicaid

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
that we ask for
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
relationships with the community mental
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
health centers
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
so that's a really important investment
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
that has uh
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
we we brought that initially forward
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
almost two months ago now it is tied up
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the in the approval process we're
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
hoping to get that move forward in the
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
coming weeks
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
there will be a second
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
project that i bring forward with an
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
additional 15 million dollar investment
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
to build a similar size hospital in the
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state although not
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
near wrapping
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
both hospitals will have specialty
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
programs for adolescents for gerry
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
diagnostic assessments and a variety of
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
other specialties
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
when we have when our system our mental
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
health system specifically our hospital
 
00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:41.510 align:start position:0%
health system specifically our hospital
capacity

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
runs at a hundred percent occupancy at a
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of the time
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't serve the patient well
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
if you can just imagine if every
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
hospital was at a hundred percent
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
capacity you're just putting people in
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
beds without
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
thought of does
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
are they receiving the the same type of
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
care so you may have someone that is
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
clinically depressed
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
rooming with someone that is manic
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
not exactly a good pairing and not very
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
therapeutic for that person either
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
so as we build out capacity it gives us
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to start specializing in
 
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.230 align:start position:0%
the ability to start specializing in
programs

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
like many states if it right now if you
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
want specialized care for uh for ocd
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
you would go to mclean because we don't
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
have an ocd clinic here in new hampshire
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
if you wanted specialized programming
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
for a multitude of mental health
 
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.310 align:start position:0%
for a multitude of mental health
disorders

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
disorders
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
you would go out of this state because
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
we do not have that capacity here as we
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
build capacity the goal
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
is to build out our specialty care so
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens can get their
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
care in their communities and in our
 
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.590 align:start position:0%
care in their communities and in our
state

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
probably five years ago i was asked to
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
fix this the mental health system i was
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
asked by both parties by the house by
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
the senate by the governor
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
by the executive council
 
00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:08.230 align:start position:0%
by the executive council
um

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.029 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from kacha and and
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
you've seen what we've done thus far to
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
try to fix these issues
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
this is what i believe is going to fix
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's been very
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
strategic on
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
what we built out first but it is now
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
time to build out the inpatient setting
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
so with that i am going to hand it over
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
to kacha one question if i may the last
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
of these series of facilities
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh do i remember correctly that this is
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
a joint venture with a hospital
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
the i i haven't been able to bring the
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
name forward i do expect to be able to
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
bring it forward in the next three or
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
four weeks it is a current hospital in
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire yes
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
i won't bring it forward either
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
edwards this is just a small detail on
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
that i've been tracking um you mentioned
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
specifically epping as the site location
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
for the 40 beds
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
how mature that decision is has it been
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
finalized has epping
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
signed off on all the permits and
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
everything because i i understand epping
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
is devoid of the sewer and water
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
over in the area that is needed and and
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
that that it's still in the air so could
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
you give me an update on
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
leadership from portsmouth hospital
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
which is an hca hospital has met with
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
the town of epping
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
they do have a personal land picked out
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
when we started these discussions
 
00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:45.909 align:start position:0%
when we started these discussions
probably

00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
in the fall
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
with the hope to bringing it forward in
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
january their intent was to break ground
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
this spring
 
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.029 align:start position:0%
this spring
so

00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
with the delay in having the having this
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
kind of caught up in the approval
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
process i'm not sure if they're still
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
going to be able to break ground in the
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
spring it depends on how quickly we can
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
move forward because what's caught up
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
right now or what's being delayed is the
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
accept and expend of federal funds we
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
haven't even got to the contracting
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
process yet
 
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.310 align:start position:0%
process yet
because

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
i need to accept it i need i need
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
approval to accept the federal funds
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
before i can hit the negotiation table
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
um so that that's going to take several
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
months to do um my understanding is that
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
they have had conversations with the
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
town of epping to you know the town of
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
epping wants to make sure that you know
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
the tax revenue is still going to be
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
there and and um i i don't believe
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
there's any issues that has been brought
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
forward around building it on the site
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner i do have a
 
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.110 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner i do have a
follow-up

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
can you stay for one more yeah i'm gonna
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
stay until kochi is done okay so the
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up on that would just be um
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
i know that the joint fiscal committee
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh approved the uh acceptance and
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
expenditure when you say you're still
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
waiting something what what what are you
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
waiting on did the executive council not
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
act or what
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
the executive councilor council have not
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
has we have not had sufficient votes at
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
the executive council so we've had to
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
remove it from the agenda
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
for four meetings now or not put it on
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
the agenda for four meetings so i have a
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
non-meeting with the executive council
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
next week hoping to be able to answer
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
their questions so we can put it on the
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
following meeting and get the votes to
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
and welcome mr
 
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.389 align:start position:0%
and welcome mr
fox

00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
fox
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
so good morning uh
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair and members of the committee
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm katya foxx i'm the director of the
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
division for
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
behavioral health for the department i'm
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
going to walk you through the slide deck
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm not going to read it word for
 
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.909 align:start position:0%
but i'm not going to read it word for
word

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:03.430 align:start position:0%
word
because

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
there are many many details as we get
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
further into the
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
into the presentation i do want to
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
apologize right up front that we did not
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
include page numbers so
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps we'll take questions as we
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
go along and rather than having to flip
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
back and forth as we go so i'll pause
 
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.149 align:start position:0%
back and forth as we go so i'll pause
after

00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
when we start getting into those details
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
i also do want to recognize that um
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
julianne carbon and rebecca ross will be
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
following me and they will have some
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
more specific details which were a
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
request that was made i believe it
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
originated with senator rosenwald last
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
year and have been carried over for a
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
period of time so we will be addressing
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
those um
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
they will be addressing those as we go
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
along so i'll note those
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
so what we wanted to do this morning is
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
to provide to you
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
a an update on where we're at so we
 
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.389 align:start position:0%
a an update on where we're at so we
often

00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
for an example they're going to provide
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
information about specific programs but
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to provide a bigger
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
picture of where we're at and our
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
strategy and how each of these
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
components that you hear about
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
either through the news or through
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
legislation or through particular
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
updates how they all fit together
 
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
updates how they all fit together
so

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
one commitment that was made as part of
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan is that we would not
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
have it just be a plan that sits on the
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
shelf that it's a living breathing
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
document and that we will continue to
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
update it and to continue to get
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
as much information and be
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
as relevant as possible given the times
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
when we said say 10 years it does
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
in some ways it doesn't seem like it's
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
very long
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
plan that was at put forth will be
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
relevant 10 years later but as we know
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
from our experience over the last couple
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
years things change
 
00:31:06.399 --> 00:31:07.430 align:start position:0%
years things change
so

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
some of the first couple of pages have
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
to do with some of the statistics
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're always a good reminder to have
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
before us so that we know
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
the people that we're serving and how
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
many of our community members are
 
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.029 align:start position:0%
many of our community members are
impacted

00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:24.070 align:start position:0%
impacted
by

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:24.870 align:start position:0%
by
the

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral health challenges
 
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.110 align:start position:0%
behavioral health challenges
so

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
and we have all the sources cited so if
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
you have questions about that we can
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
provide those
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
so we talk about the adult population
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
one in four
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
we talk about children with depression
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
yet aren't receiving treatment
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.990 align:start position:0%
we talk about
children

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
and youth involved with the child
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
welfare system
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
and what we're finding with
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
that particular population and how many
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
have these mental health disorders and
 
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.669 align:start position:0%
have these mental health disorders and
challenges

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
and what led them there um so
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
you know that's a lot of the work that
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
our partner at the division
 
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.590 align:start position:0%
our partner at the division
for

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
children youth and families joe ripsom
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative edwards
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you miss fox on the
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
page where it says 47 percent of new
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire children with depression are
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
not receiving treatment
 
00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:31.350 align:start position:0%
not receiving treatment
what

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
what is a reasonable attainable goal for
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
what that percentage ought to be
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
and do you have statistics pre-pandemic
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
2017-18 that would indicate you know
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
what the pandemic has done to set us
 
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.549 align:start position:0%
what the pandemic has done to set us
back

00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
so i will take your last question first
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
and say that we can provide that to you
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
and give that comparison
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
um of course my response is going to be
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent um are receiving
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
treatment but to be realistic we would
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
want to see this number
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
cut in half
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you because we we need to budget
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
for reasonable
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
goals and not for perfection you mean
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
for idealistic like um i just stated i'm
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
glad you're an idealist though
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
this slide that shows the adverse
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
impacts we have included this this is
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
something that samsa
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
has developed and it really shows the
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
stages that
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
happen when there has been um a
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
an event
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
what we have found is that when we first
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
started seeing this slide in 2020
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
that uh it it assumed that there was a
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
disaster and that there was a hurricane
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
that there was a tornado that there was
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
a flood um or something to that effect
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
what we didn't anticipate when this
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
first uh was
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
put forth in those publications was that
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
we would have a duration of the time
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
period that we've had with the pandemic
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
you could go along this line and see
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
where we're at and say okay we're right
 
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.869 align:start position:0%
where we're at and say okay we're right
here

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then we could be thrown right back
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
and we saw that with the
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
variants and the waves that we've
 
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.230 align:start position:0%
variants and the waves that we've
experienced

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
optimistic again reconstruction that's
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
where we are and that's what we're
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
working with
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
as we as we go through this
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and the efforts that we're
 
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.430 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and the efforts that we're
taking

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
the drivers of transformation
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
there have been many
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
they evolve and so of course there's the
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
recognition we had the recognition
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
well before the pandemic with the
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
creation of the
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year plan
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
and the children's system of care the
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
statute that addresses children's needs
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
we've had a window of opportunity we
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
have medicaid everyone thinks of
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid is just paying the doctor's
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
bills and covering routine services
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
medicaid has evolved so that it's become
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
a driver of change it's a tool that
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're able to use and able to create
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
different types of approaches that are
 
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.510 align:start position:0%
different types of approaches that are
more

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate for communities and less a
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
medical model so that really has evolved
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
and changed and we've been able to use
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
that flexibility and able to stand up
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
some more systems as a result of that in
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
doing things differently
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
community-based investments we'll talk a
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
lot about those and the commissioner
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
vision and values i'll let you read that
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
of course number one it's
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be centered and driven by the
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
and again i i'm going to leave it so
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
that you can read this at a later time
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
and go into
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
more of the details the the next slide
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
the next page which has the inverted
 
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.589 align:start position:0%
the next page which has the inverted
triangle

00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
is looking at the different levels that
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
we are facing and how we go from lower
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
acute acuity to higher acuity
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
and when i look at this at first i was
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
like okay shouldn't prevention and early
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
intervention be at the foundation and be
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
at the bottom but if you really look at
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
this as a funnel
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
we look at population health in the top
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
um with prevention and early
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
intervention and then we see and that's
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
where we serve we and we
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
need to invest even more
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
in serving the greatest population
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
across the state and then we start
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
getting down into the different levels
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
based on the different levels of needs
 
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.589 align:start position:0%
based on the different levels of needs
so

00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
community-based services we're going to
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
talk a lot about that again julianne and
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
rebecca will be highlighting a couple of
 
00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.630 align:start position:0%
rebecca will be highlighting a couple of
areas

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
we have crisis response that is again
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
they'll be talking about new hampshire
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
rapid response the mobile crisis
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
and that's really something that we
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
spent a considerable amount of time a
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
lot of investment a lot of work with our
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
community partners to stand up a system
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
that can be
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
responsive to individuals before they
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
hit the highest level and and have the
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
highest need which is that acute and
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
specialty care so this means in real
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
words emergency room diversion
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
why would somebody need to go to an
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
emergency room if they could be served
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
in their home or in their community and
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
be able to have that on the front lines
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
and um have people served where
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
frankly it makes more sense
 
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.270 align:start position:0%
frankly it makes more sense
so

00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'll pause representative edwards
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i i think you you probably hit the
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
slide that says prevention and early
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
intervention the the subtitle under that
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
refers to addressing the social
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
determinants of behavioral health
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
which just makes me wonder to what
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
extent are the social determinants of
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
behavioral health distinct from
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
social determinants of health
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
what what new things are being brought
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
into this when you say that
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
they really are the same
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
there are so many drivers um one one
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
area that does come to mind um is
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
for behavioral health is the adverse
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
and how those impact and that's a
 
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.630 align:start position:0%
and how those impact and that's a
behavioral

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
behavioral
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
health need that needs to be addressed
 
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.430 align:start position:0%
health need that needs to be addressed
early

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
so that we have that intervention so it
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't manifest itself
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
in a more
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
all right um so again this goes into
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
details here for each one of those
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
components so prevention and early
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
intervention one thing that became very
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
clear uh through the 10-year plan was
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
that we were not doing enough to
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
specifically call out and address
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so there have been a lot of efforts
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
around that for the very first time the
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
legislature had funded
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
actually put funding behind
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
this effort
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
and we were able to in the department
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
hire a suicide prevention
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
coordinator and that coordinator works
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
very closely with a suicide prevention
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
council in carrying out these efforts
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
there have been trainings in schools
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
and then again the rapid response which
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
we've had the first episode psychosis
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
again an early intervention if you have
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
someone who experiences a crisis very
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
early on getting those regional teams in
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
and having them address those needs to
 
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.109 align:start position:0%
and having them address those needs to
prevent

00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.069 align:start position:0%
prevent
further

00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
and we always have training and
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
consultation which seems
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
like a luxury but it's not a luxury it's
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
an investment that we need to make so
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
as much
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice going on so that
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
family supports this has been really
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
critical this fast forward program which
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
is families and systems together that is
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
a program that serves over 400 families
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
and continues to grow it was a very
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
small program when we first started and
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
it has been so successful in helping
 
00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.349 align:start position:0%
it has been so successful in helping
families

00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
address the needs of their children
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
that it again it's more investment and
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
more time but it's
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like we've got 400 families
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
receiving intensive family supports i'm
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
just because we've talked about equity
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
earlier in the slide deck i'm just
 
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.069 align:start position:0%
earlier in the slide deck i'm just
curious

00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
curious
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
if you know anything about the
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
demographics of those 400 and if those
 
00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:29.589 align:start position:0%
demographics of those 400 and if those
demographics

00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
map the standard new hampshire profile
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
and if not how what are the distinctions
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
i do not have that oh thank you um i do
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
not have that information here it's
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
something that we can provide we do have
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
a breakdown of demographics on this
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you looking forward to it
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
all right again um i find myself before
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
this committee the only times that i've
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
appeared i'm always looking at my watch
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
saying wow
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
i need to speed up and i and i don't do
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
that the person who uh
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
plans my schedule for me is
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
very thorough in the amount of work
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
given to us so we like to move along
 
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.670 align:start position:0%
given to us so we like to move along
quickly

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay great so again i'll be available
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
for follow-up questions at any point in
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
time and would be happy to entertain
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
those and come back at a different time
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
community-based services
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
substance use disorders we haven't
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about the services that we
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
have there
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
doorway program
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's recovery supports we have over a
 
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.710 align:start position:0%
it's recovery supports we have over a
dozen

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
dozen
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
recovery community organizations across
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
we have respite services and we have
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
overdose prevention
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
first and foremost the distribution of
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
naloxone throughout our communities
 
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.950 align:start position:0%
naloxone throughout our communities
housing

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
julianne and rebecca will be talking
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
more about housing so i think i'll
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
skip through that
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
peer support with our workforce
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
shortages that persist
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
we know that the investment in in the
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
peer network and the workforce is really
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
important going forward and we're taking
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
many opportunities to be able to invest
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
flipping over to acute
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has addressed
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
the drfs which
 
00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:23.910 align:start position:0%
the drfs which
in

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
in case it's not obvious the hospitals
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about and the new
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
beds that we're talking about will be
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
we have a waiver um and i know henry
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
lipman is here as medicaid director if
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
you want more information about what the
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
waiver does be happy to talk about that
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
but that's another mechanism whereby
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
which we're able to obtain federal
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
matching funds from medicaid to help us
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
pay for those
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
the prtf the commissioner did
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
address and that is part of the
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
hampstead plan to be able to have that
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
level of care which is in it's in
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
between the community-based beds and the
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
acute setting it's really the highest
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
need before
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
a child would need to go into
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
an acute psychiatric
 
00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:20.950 align:start position:0%
an acute psychiatric
hospital

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
before we move on under hampstead
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
hospital operation and expansion
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
now by expansion i'm going to assume
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
that simply means
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's presently about 35 residents in
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
a facility that can hold over 100 and
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to move it up to the
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
maximum it does not mean bricks and
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
mortar expansion just to be clear thank
 
00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:42.710 align:start position:0%
mortar expansion just to be clear thank
you

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct good got it
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'll be asked on this one
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely there's no intent there are
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
111 beds that are currently licensed and
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of groom room to grow and
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
expand within those licensed beds
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
again the forensic hospital has been
 
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.990 align:start position:0%
again the forensic hospital has been
addressed

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
supportive transitions critical time
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
intervention is a new program for the
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire it is something
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
that was supported by the legislature
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the funding of this program which is
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
to have an individual who works with
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
someone who is exiting
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
in transitioning from new hampshire
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
hospital or a drf and get into the
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
community and be successful
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
so this is about the skills that are
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
needed to maintain someone's
 
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.390 align:start position:0%
needed to maintain someone's
health

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
including behavioral health and that
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
includes making sure that they have all
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
the supports and we talked about the
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
social determinants that they have all
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
of those supports
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
and checking in on them so it's one
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
person who follows someone
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
throughout a period of nine months and
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
that program is
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
being run by our community mental health
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
centers we have four centers that have
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
it now and it will expand july 1st to
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
again more training
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
we have the
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
next slide with the enabling
 
00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
next slide with the enabling
infrastructure

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
and what that looks like of course
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's all about funding and mechanisms
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
to be successful in the
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
carrying out of all these programs
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
and then we just have the appendix which
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
really talks about again referring back
 
00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:30.870 align:start position:0%
really talks about again referring back
to

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.829 align:start position:0%
to
the

00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
facility level of care that the
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner has already addressed
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be happy to answer
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
more questions or step aside
 
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.109 align:start position:0%
more questions or step aside
senator

00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thanks katja i
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
have three questions if i could um
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
i know that as of
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
um january this year
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
all of the community mental health
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
centers were
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
tasked with opening up crisis
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
intervention teams but also
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
opening crisis beds how many beds are
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
currently online and is it all of them
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
so um i'm going to defer to jillian
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
carbon the director of the bureau of
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
mental health services who will be
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
addressing that in the next presentation
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
great and um i think you said that
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
the hampstead
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
i mean sorry the hca expansion and the
 
00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.270 align:start position:0%
i mean sorry the hca expansion and the
one

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
who has not yet been named
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
drf beds but in the past i think the
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
department has said they would be dually
 
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.230 align:start position:0%
department has said they would be dually
licensed

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
has that changed no they will be both
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
they will be uh duly both voluntary
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
involuntary um obviously like children's
 
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.829 align:start position:0%
involuntary um obviously like children's
beds

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
beds
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
we don't typically have drf beds in
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
children's services because
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
kids can be admitted by their their
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
guardian voluntary by guardian so for
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
adult population they will be both
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
voluntary and involuntary thank you and
 
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
voluntary and involuntary thank you and
finally

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of medicaid rate increases does
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
the department think our medicaid rates
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
are now high enough
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
and if not is the department planning to
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
bring forward
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
rate increases in the next budget
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's something i'm going to have to
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
defer to henry on henry is our medicaid
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
expert the drf rate specifically we
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
doubled about two years ago
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
so i assume that we are talking about
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
community-based care
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
we just did an increase for transitional
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
housing services with the
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
community-based programs
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
that took
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
effect last july i believe
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
because there is a requirement for them
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
to each build out six additional beds
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
for transitional housing so we did
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
increase their rates uh back in july
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
the community
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
based other rates like i said henry
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
henry could address that for you thank
 
00:49:07.359 --> 00:49:09.670 align:start position:0%
henry could address that for you thank
you

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
and if i could just add on that um
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
that we look at that often there are
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
many of those rates that now are um
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
more they're they're adequate um
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
and we always have some lines of service
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
that are out of black um so we always
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
look at those as well but we have some
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
other payment mechanisms i'd be happy to
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
talk to you about and i'm sure henry
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
would as well
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
that are directed payments to incent
 
00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.349 align:start position:0%
that are directed payments to incent
certain

00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
programs and activities by the
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
i'm more familiar with the
 
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.710 align:start position:0%
i'm more familiar with the
transportation

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
10-year plan which always struck me as
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
structured enough so you're not
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
wandering around aimlessly yet fluid
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
enough so that certain things can be
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
adjusted as needed this strikes me as
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
similar to that is that your intent
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
that was a softball
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's exactly what we're
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
trying to get at at the beginning of the
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
presentation that it does need to be
 
00:50:11.359 --> 00:50:13.270 align:start position:0%
presentation that it does need to be
flexible

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
i think that 10 years is a long time and
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
in healthcare
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
best practices evolve over that 10-year
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
period so as much as we lay out our
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
strategy when something new like cti is
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
not in the 10-year mental health plan
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
but it is a an exceptional program that
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
was brought to us new york state has
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
done it
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
and it does address the overall concept
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year mental health plan which
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
is transitions of care but it's not
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
specifically called out so it provides
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
us a strategy but we need that
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
flexibility within that strategy to to
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
take advantage of new
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
new programs and new ideas and mental
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
health i'm doing the same with my board
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
of directors so i understand it thank
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative mckay
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for letting me sit
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
in today
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
the ketchup
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
as you know i have a
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
significant interest in this
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and the 10-year plan that
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
came before this
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
what one of my goals is to
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
bring back the mental health caucus
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
that representative snow and myself and
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
several others
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
including our chairman want to
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
participate in that program but my goal
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
when mental health
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislation comes in front of us
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
that we use this 10 year plan
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
as the guide
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
and we have had one legislation
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
one piece of legislation
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
this year that was rather sensitive
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
that this plan helped us very much to
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
deal with that legislation around peer
 
00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:04.950 align:start position:0%
deal with that legislation around peer
support

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.309 align:start position:0%
support
so

00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
this is not a warning that
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
that we're bringing that caucus back but
 
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.390 align:start position:0%
that we're bringing that caucus back but
that

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
we certainly seek your
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
participation and the team participation
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
and we very much appreciate
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
what the commissioner has done
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh because i remember the days over in
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
the county so that
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
we are pleased with that
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
as well so thank you very much for
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
letting me sit here
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
as a novice involved in all of this have
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
we always had this
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
these problems percentage wise as in you
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
know going back 10 15 years ago or is a
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the inc is an increase and if
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
so i think um that i am not i this is
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
just me and not any statistic i'm going
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
to use um off the top of my head but
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
that we have always had this problem um
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
this problem uh has been something that
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
has not been addressed because we didn't
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
talk about it
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
we never talked about mental health we
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
never do you know came out and said i
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
have a problem
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
i need help i'm struggling and now that
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
we have had the support of the
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
legislature and
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
of the governor and the policy makers to
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
be able to talk about it and normalize
 
00:53:35.839 --> 00:53:36.950 align:start position:0%
be able to talk about it and normalize
it

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
i think that's why we are seeing some of
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
those increases but i also think that
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
there are factors that come in
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
um such as the pandemic that create
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll just add to that that
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know back in the
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
i would say the 80s and the 90s we
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
probably had one of the most evolved
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
mental health systems in our country
 
00:54:05.119 --> 00:54:05.950 align:start position:0%
mental health systems in our country
we

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
de-institutionalized what was about 3
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
000 patients at new hampshire hospital
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
all of those buildings on that campus
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
had patients in them at one time
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
and i think what you've seen between the
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
year of 2000 and year 2011 2012 is this
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
very small erosion of our system over
 
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
very small erosion of our system over
time

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
with the kind of the breaking point
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
coming in 2011 when they closed the
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
annafell brook children's hospital and
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
they moved the kids into new hampshire
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
hospital that removed 44 beds from
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
the pool of adult beds that's when the
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
waitlist started but in addition to that
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
change we saw small community-based
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
programs close and maybe it was only 10
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
beds or 12 beds but when you have one of
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
those programs close every single year
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
before long your infrastructure suffers
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
so we saw this very slow erosion of our
 
00:54:56.799 --> 00:54:57.910 align:start position:0%
so we saw this very slow erosion of our
system

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
that led up to kind of the crisis point
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
of where we're at now so now we are
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
rebuilding the system that we once had
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take several years to
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner i was living in
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts at the time when an
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
extensive series of mental health
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals were being closed all over the
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
state with a view to establish
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
community-based and as i recollect the
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
big enemy against
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay now that you've closed these what
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
are you going to open was nimby
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
was that the case in new hampshire or
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
would you point to other factors as well
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
um i think that that that there is
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
always um some part of nimby that that
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
enters into mental health there are you
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
know we we address the stigma issue um
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work to be done around
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
stigma um stigma in our communities uh
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know there is not a lot of people
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
that will live in an apartment building
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
and have someone that maybe
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know is having hallucinations or
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
delusions next door and they're talking
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
to themselves there's not a lot of
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
people that embrace those people right
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
or our homeless person on the sidewalk
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
that that you know to the rest of us
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
seems like they're acting different
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
so there is a lot of stigma that goes
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
there that we need to as a society to
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
move past and and really kind of embrace
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
that vulnerable part of our population
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
i think the people that need inpatient
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
care need inpatient care and
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know i think that is uh
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
something that we're realizing right now
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
how many community-based programs when
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
someone is in crisis and needs that
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
inpatient bed there's not another
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
program that's going to replace an
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
inpatient bed we everything that
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
everything that can
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
defer them from the hospital we're doing
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
the the crisis the mobile crisis all of
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
those things but when someone really
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
gets there we need the inpatient bed
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
one more and then we'll move on to our
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
next report representative edwards okay
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'll just share these observations about
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
this plan and you can you don't have to
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
respond you could just figure out what
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
you want to do with these comments
 
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
you want to do with these comments
um

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
on enabling infrastructure
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like you want to have a
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
fourth line in here for information
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
technology i know we're doing so much in
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
the it space and i gotta assume that
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
some amount of it
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
is necessary to be done in order to help
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
become part of your enabling
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the other thing that when
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
i look at
 
00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.349 align:start position:0%
i look at
a

00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
set of lines like this
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
like in the future step area if if you
 
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.150 align:start position:0%
like in the future step area if if you
considered

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
doing a red green yellow kind of a
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
status thing so it's easier to draw our
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
attention to what's going well and what
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know the red ones might be the ones
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
that we need to do something about which
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
which opens up the third observation
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
which is uh i don't know if you'd want
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
to do this in here but uh
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you could consider a page on
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislative support priorities
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
so that you know we know you guys are
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
working but we don't know
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
from this i can't tell
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
what the legislature needs to be doing
 
00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:15.829 align:start position:0%
what the legislature needs to be doing
to

00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
to work with you in coming years so
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
no need to respond just thoughts
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
i will respond however just to say those
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
are very good tips for upcoming
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
legislative process that we're going to
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you miss fox and thank you
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
now we're trying to catch up we had
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
three items
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we didn't get to in january and the
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
snowstorm ran us out in february but we
 
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
also have a leftover from september 24th
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
2021 designated receiving facilities and
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%

00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
morning for the record rebecca ross
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
director of the bureau for children's
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
and i think we can we can start by
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
addressing senator rosenwald's question
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the crisis housing and we do
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
have a handout and i think in future
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
iterations given the question we'll add
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit more detail about the
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
crisis response services um but it's a
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
handout that looks like this with the
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
kind of circles on the side
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
and um so in addition to the crisis
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis apartments that we have we
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
also have the step up step down
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
apartments run by our peer support
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
agencies but i think the question you
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
had was really around the additional 60
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
beds that we recently um contracted for
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
show us what that looks like again it
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
should be this one with the well i'm
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
running out of paper and i don't have
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay it might be underneath these one
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
we do have an eye doctor in the room if
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
needed representative
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
don't ask me what color
 
01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.069 align:start position:0%
don't ask me what color
okay

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're good okay fantastic
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
um and so i mean this creates a summary
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
but essentially what we have seen is
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the housing market is very tight
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
and so that has created some barriers
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
for our agencies to move forward with
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing of properties
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
as well as even getting supplies in so
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
getting refrigerators beds things to
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
actually furnish the apartments with has
 
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.430 align:start position:0%
actually furnish the apartments with has
been

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
causing delays and with our transitional
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
housing programs it's been some delays
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
with both
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
furnishing the apartments and staffing
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
nine of the ten centers have been
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
contracted to
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
expand their six bed programs and are
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
all actively working on
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
purchasing properties and getting them
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
set up none are open today accepting new
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
clients but they're all in process and
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that our team is
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
working very closely with the centers on
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
so we can move on to the exciting stuff
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
of rapid response
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
thanks julianne we're just going to give
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
a quick update i know this was the
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
update we were supposed to give a couple
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
months ago um
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
as you're aware rapid response launched
 
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.230 align:start position:0%
as you're aware rapid response launched
on

01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
january 1 and we have some of that
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
january data overall we would call it a
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
success it is up and operating
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
there have been deployments in every
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
state what we're going to do is put
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
together some high-level data that we're
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to transition into a regular
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
monthly report
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
this is preliminary data it's the first
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
month we're still working hard to verify
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
that data and combine it with other data
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
sources so this will grow and expand
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
over time but this is the initial
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
snapshot of what we've seen
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
and as a reminder mobile crisis allows
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
individuals in the community to call
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
text or chat through a centralized
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
access point
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
about 75 percent of those encounters are
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
resolved over the phone through that
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
access point and about a quarter of them
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
result in deployments so in january
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
there were a little over 1500 contacts
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
with unique individuals so
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
you know within the range of what we
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
expected there's still additional
 
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
outreach and education with the
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
community as we're going forward we
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate that would grow um but 1500
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
contacts in the first 30 days is
 
01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:18.069 align:start position:0%
contacts in the first 30 days is
certainly

01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that there is engagement
 
01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.670 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that there is engagement
statewide

01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
we have confirmed that there have been
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
deployments in all parts of the state
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
and all regions as well so we know it is
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
it is operating across the board
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions at any time
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
if you want to jump in
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
yeah um i know what the word
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
transitional means but could you give a
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
little bit of narrative
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
who is transitioning from what to where
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay so for mobile crisis
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's we are calling it the
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rapid response access
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
point and that is a crisis response that
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
anyone can call in on behalf of
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
themselves or on behalf of
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
another individual there will be
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
triage and
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
coordination on the phone and if
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
the individual services can or needs can
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
be met through services on the phone
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
then they can arrange follow-up care or
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
come up with another plan for that
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
individual if the individual believes
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
that they need to see someone in person
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
we have a team that can go out statewide
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
and see them
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
we're partnering with our community
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
mental health centers so the access
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
point would transition to deploy a
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
community mental health center they're
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
all in the process of standing up their
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
teams staffing is certainly a challenge
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
for all of them and particularly in
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
certain regions of the state but they
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
all have functioning teams there's also
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
the capacity to
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
be deployed to another region so if one
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
region is fully deployed or unavailable
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
the access point will then go to the
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
next available closest region and deploy
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
so they're coordinating the services
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
statewide for the deployment teams that
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
are operating out of our community
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
mental health centers thank you
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
we saw about 80
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the individuals served were adults
 
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
of the individuals served were adults
and

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
um a little under 20 were
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
youth so under 18
 
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
and that was
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
290 youth under 18 that's a population
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
that was never served by the three prior
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis teams so we are definitely
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
seeing that that engagement is getting
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
out there that did also cover all of
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
the regions so
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
um we'll work on increasing that
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
utilization to avoid hospitalization and
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
avoid emergency departments but
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
that reflects that it is in fact up and
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
running across the board
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
there were in 30 days there were over
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
400 mobile deployments that means the
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
team's going out
 
01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:52.630 align:start position:0%
team's going out
um

01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
and again those were statewide and 120
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
of those were for youth so for about a
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
third of the youth that called in or a
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
little more than a third
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
the team went out and engaged with the
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
youth so
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
we will work on the data we'll work on
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
adding trending data and a little bit
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
deeper dive but overall for that
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
snapshot for the first month for
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
something brand new statewide
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
we have had a great experience with our
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
contractor and their collaboration with
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
our community mental health centers to
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
to operationalize across the state
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
just a
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
coordination point with you as much as
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
anyone mr chair
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
one of the future topics i had requested
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't ask for any of it today
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
at some point get a summary of all the
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
mobile mental health team fans i i just
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
want to know i think we're supposed to
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
end up with five of them
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
i'd be curious to to go into the detail
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
on how well we're doing on stacking
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
those things up so
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
is that's in your purview right you're
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
tracking the mobile response teams
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay teams but were you asking
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
specifically about vehicles
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
the whole pro
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
it's like a bed
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
you you you have to have the staff you
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
have to have everything around it so
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
when i when i think about these five
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
mobile response vans i think of all the
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
capability that needs to be associated
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
with it to make it productive and so i'd
 
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.750 align:start position:0%
with it to make it productive and so i'd
like

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
in a future hhs if we oversight
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
do a deep dive on where we are with uh
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
standing up those vans and how
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
productive they each are being not in
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
the aggregate
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay i think julianne is going to give
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
we can talk offline i'm afraid i'm just
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
burning too much time we will we do have
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
some additional information about teams
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
um the other visual that looks like this
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
that's color coded gives again a visual
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
snapshot of where we're at with staffing
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
up our teams
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
by region and so i think tying some of
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
the data to that is what we will look at
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
in future months but this gives you
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
again just an overview of the of the
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
staffing and as you can see third shift
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
is where we have the most significant
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
amount of staffing challenges and so as
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
we mentioned last time we are looking at
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
this as a statewide response system so
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
if someone calls texts or chats and
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
needs a mobile response
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
and we don't have one available um you
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
know we will be trying to deploy support
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
via telehealth if um and using any
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
region that has a clinician available
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
and then the last resort would be
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
referring someone to
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
an emergency department but we have
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
other options like next day appointments
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your report
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
next on our agenda is a follow-up to
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 1290
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
and representative rogers who is the
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor of it is here with us
 
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.829 align:start position:0%
sponsor of it is here with us
today

01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:04.950 align:start position:0%
today
this

01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
is a bill that came to my health and
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
human services and elderly affairs
 
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.990 align:start position:0%
human services and elderly affairs
committee

01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
and we thought that the best vehicle to
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
establish a task force was not
 
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.829 align:start position:0%
establish a task force was not
through

01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
um the descriptors the lines in the bill
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
but in something that would better come
 
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.309 align:start position:0%
but in something that would better come
under

01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
that was our
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
unanimous conclusion
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
i had asked representative soloway to
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
take and run with it he was most
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
articulate in the committee when we
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
looked at this and i asked him to
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
develop something and present it to us
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
today so representative soloway
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much mr chairman uh
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm delighted to have representative
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
rogers here with us uh today
 
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.709 align:start position:0%
rogers here with us uh today
um

01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
the bill that she drafted that brought
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
that came before health and human
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
services was articulate it had a
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
remarkably good blueprint for how a task
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
force might proceed
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
i had one major objection
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
to that bill and that was it called for
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
a final report due november of 2024
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
it was my own sense and the sense of the
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
committee that uh such a report on an
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
emerging technology for biomarker
 
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.910 align:start position:0%
emerging technology for biomarker
testing

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
testing
for

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
precision medicine
 
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.950 align:start position:0%
precision medicine
didn't

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't stand a two-year delay in the
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
final report that we needed to be
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
much more forward-looking dare i say
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
much more aggressive and agile in
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
putting together a report and therefore
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
i moved interim study on that bill with
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
direction to the chairman of health and
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
human services oversight of course
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
chairman pearson
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
that it be remanded to this oversight
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
committee for much more immediate action
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
i would point out that representative
 
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.149 align:start position:0%
i would point out that representative
rogers

01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
rogers
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
has brought
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
to us a wonderful opportunity it's a
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
two-fold opportunity one of them
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
obviously is to deal with the issue at
 
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.149 align:start position:0%
obviously is to deal with the issue at
hand

01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at the technology for
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
precision medicine and let's see what we
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
can do to enhance that technology here
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but at the same time
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
she instructs us that
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
the process of developing legislation is
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
the attempt to sharpen what is basically
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
a blunt tool we in the legislature work
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
with a if you will blunt tool and the
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions are
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
is it our role in the legislature to
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
create legislation to facilitate such
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
technologies i.e to implement them as a
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
state activity
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps our role to encourage
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
the development of such technologies
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps to incentivize them government
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
does this routinely with things like tax
 
01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.390 align:start position:0%
does this routinely with things like tax
incentives

01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
incentives
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
is it our role to publicize to
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
emerge as
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
loud speakers on the bully pulpit to get
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
our colleagues in the professional
 
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.189 align:start position:0%
our colleagues in the professional
organizations

01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
to get the word out to practitioners and
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
to the public that these technologies
 
01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.750 align:start position:0%
to the public that these technologies
exist

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
and can be and should be utilized
 
01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:39.669 align:start position:0%
and can be and should be utilized
and

01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:39.679 --> 01:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
and
finally

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
is it our role to provide oversight to
 
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.070 align:start position:0%
is it our role to provide oversight to
regulate

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
these technologies perhaps through the
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
oversight committee with that we sit
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
with today or perhaps to create a role
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
for dhhs in regulating these activities
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
so in this regard
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
i would like to request of the chair
 
01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:04.470 align:start position:0%
i would like to request of the chair
that

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
he appoint
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
a task force from this committee to
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
begin work immediately
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully with a final report due
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
within a matter of months and not years
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
i would hope that this can be done in
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
three or four months time with intensive
 
01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.830 align:start position:0%
three or four months time with intensive
activity

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
i would add parenthetically just for my
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
own purposes that for those of you who
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
are interested the cost of this emerging
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
technology right now is quite
 
01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.790 align:start position:0%
technology right now is quite
extraordinary

01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative rogers has a gofundme
 
01:13:39.199 --> 01:13:40.149 align:start position:0%
representative rogers has a gofundme
site

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
site
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%

as well but mr chairman i would
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
you consider the appointment of a task
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
force to deal with the issues of
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
biomarkers precision medicine genetic
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
testing and all the technologies that
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
are associated
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative might i uh try
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
to massage that a little bit and suggest
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
a task force
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
of just a few of us to work
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
with you as really the prime mover on
 
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.430 align:start position:0%
with you as really the prime mover on
this

01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
then to delineate what a future task
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
force subgroup of this committee would
 
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.990 align:start position:0%
force subgroup of this committee would
be

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
with whom we would like to
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
attract to be part of our work from even
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
around the country in other words a step
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
before the step
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i should think that if there were
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
three or four of us
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
we could bat this off in an afternoon
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
and come up with a plan of what a
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
subgroup like we did with representative
 
01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:47.669 align:start position:0%
subgroup like we did with representative
rice

01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
rice
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
might look like
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
look at the kinds of people that you've
 
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.830 align:start position:0%
look at the kinds of people that you've
already

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
initially bounced thoughts off and go
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
from there
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
how would that sound
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%

as many of you know dr sai chiralla has
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
transitioned to a wonderful new position
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
to us in a state south of us right now
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
so you have i know it's sad so you get
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
the jv team today which is me giving
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
this report so thank you all in the
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
interest of time i'm going to shorten it
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
up but i'm always happy to entertain
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions as we move along
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
for more than 20 years the work and the
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
data of the child fatality review
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee has helped policies and
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
practices that we now take for granted
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
including policies about car seats for
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
kids how we train child care providers
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
and health care providers to put infants
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
to sleep and seat belt laws for children
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
and adolescents and and by the way you
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
all have a copy of the report right here
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
in front of you there's also extras over
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
over on the side
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
the hallmark of this child fatality
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
review committee is its data-driven
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%

the good news of this 2021 report is
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire's child mortality
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
rate continues to be well below the
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
national average the report provides
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
detailed information about state level
 
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.030 align:start position:0%

trends

01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
trends
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
that we garner from the death
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
certificate data
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
among children and and youth ages
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
0 to 21 all of whom are residents of the
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire the data spans
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
from 2016 to 2020.
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
deaths due to
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
natural causes the underlying underlying
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
medical condition comprised about 56
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
percent of the total deaths in 2020 for
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
children birth through age 21 and about
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
43 percent of those deaths were from
 
01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.790 align:start position:0%
43 percent of those deaths were from
injuries

01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
the highest number of deaths occur among
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
our infants those less than one year old
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's about 35 percent of the total and
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
87 of those deaths among infants or from
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
natural causes often causes um from
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
perinatal conditions
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
the next highest death rate was among
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
those between 19 and 21. so again you
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
see the very youngest among excess and
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
then the older age group at the end of
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
the spectrum and most of those deaths
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
among the 19 to 21 year olds were not
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
from natural causes but from injuries
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
both intentional and unintentional
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
suicide is the leading cause of
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
intentional injury in children ages 1 to
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
21 and the incidence of suicide deaths
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
is among the is the highest among youth
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
19 to 21 years old
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
a little outside of the scope of the
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
child fatality review committee but i
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
think it's still important to mention is
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
that self-harm and suicide ideation
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
talking about it thinking about it
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
writing about it
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
among youth increased during the
 
01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.149 align:start position:0%
among youth increased during the
pandemic

01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
but we are thankful that overall the
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
completed suicide rates um do not to
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
have it do not appear to have increased
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
in fact the numbers may have even
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
decreased a little bit but given that
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have so few of them in
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
the state the sensitivity of whether
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's significant is still out there so
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
um the good news is is that we did not
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
see a spike in youth suicide over the
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic however we have troubling
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
indicators and as my colleague katya and
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
her entire team will note we have still
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
have significant need for the behavioral
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
health system as we saw increases in
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
both suicide ideation and self-harm so
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
but back to this group
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
during 2012
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
when you look at unintentional injury
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
among children and youth ages 1 to 21
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see that poisoning deaths due to
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
opioids again overdose deaths or related
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
to opioids motor vehicles
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
are accidents and land transport
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
accidents like atvs
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
um and blunt force trauma and drowning
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
top out the leading causes of
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
unintentional injury deaths so again
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths that's about 39 percent
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
of those motor vehicle accidents about
 
01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:15.350 align:start position:0%
of those motor vehicle accidents about
19

01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
19
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
and other land transport atvs
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles 14
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
during 2021 the committee held six
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
review meetings reviewed eight cases
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
which included four drug related
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
fatalities and four motor vehicle
 
01:22:32.639 --> 01:22:33.990 align:start position:0%
fatalities and four motor vehicle
accidents

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
accidents
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
after reviewing the cases the committee
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
proposed around 10 recommendations that
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
are listed in the report you can see
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
those along with the responsible party
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
or agency to follow up and implement
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
those recommendations the
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations reflect
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
the public health impact in improving
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
the lives of children and the impact of
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
improving the efficacy and efficiency of
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
the agencies identified under those
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations some of the highlights
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
include guidance for parents and young
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
drivers about winter driving and
 
01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
drivers about winter driving and
maintenance

01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
increased use of driving simulators for
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
young drivers to renew and refresh
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
campaigns about and public education
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%

01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
what to do when you're a passenger in
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
the car and you're uncomfortable with
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
who's driving and in their state to be
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
driving tools for adolescents to be able
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
to navigate those really tricky
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
situations that i think all of us can
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
recall from back in our younger days
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
there are also recommendations for
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
systems and policy change including
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
improving the completeness of records
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
around child fatalities from crashes
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
including identifying
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for crash reconstruction
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
when youth fatalities are involved
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
other recommendations around exploring
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
the pros and cons of additional
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
restrictions related to graduated
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses for young adults
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
some of the recommendations also focus
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
on upstream approaches to reduce and
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
prevent adverse childhood experiences
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
you just heard katya fox talk about the
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
importance of addressing those adverse
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences or aces early in a
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
family's lives so that we can prevent
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
some of the worst outcomes of behavioral
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
health problems
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
we know that increased
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
that aces in early childhood may lead to
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
increased risk-taking behaviors and
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
increase the chance for children and
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
youth to again experience substance use
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
and other behavioral health conditions
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations in the report include
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
improving referral systems for home
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
visiting programs and other wraparound
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
services broad training about the impact
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
of aces for education for our partners
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
in the schools for child care providers
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
and improving communication between
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
schools health care providers and
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral health providers
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
in the report you can also take a look
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
at updates on recommendations from the
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
previous year and where we've made
 
01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.390 align:start position:0%
previous year and where we've made
progress

01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
progress
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
additionally two subcommittees of the
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
child fatality review committee were
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
approved this year one on sudden death
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
and the young and one on sudden
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
unexpected infant death some of you may
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
remember that as sids
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
the in 2021 the sudden unexpected infant
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
death program made some significant
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
progress with safe sleep
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
work groups developing campaigns for
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
community awareness
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
sued case reviews identified targeted
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
populations where to focus education
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
efforts such as health care providers
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
parents and caregivers who co-sleep with
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
their infants one strategy that the
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
state the safe sleep work group
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
developed was to hold four town hall
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
style zoom meetings in twenty twenty
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
twenty that's a lot of twos
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
2022 to really start bringing all of
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
those stakeholders and those community
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
members together to talk about safe
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
sleep practices so i'm going to somewhat
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
there given the time that we have
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
together but i'm happy to take questions
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that we have time on
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
the agenda available for all the other
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
important updates one question from the
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
chair i see most of the responsible
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
parties are
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
aspects of dhhs or doe
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
is there anything in there that i may
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
have missed where
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
you would want to come to a few of us as
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
legislators to craft something as a
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
lsr over the summer
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that's a great idea i think the
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
group right now doesn't have a
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
particular policy in mind a piece of
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that they think will make a
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
difference but we'll certainly share
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
that with the group as they come
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
together to do that work
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh this is a
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
definitional one on page eight you talk
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
about certain conditions originating in
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
the perinatal period
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is the word
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
perinatal is is uh
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
not consistently defined sometimes it's
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
seven days after birth sometimes it's 28
 
01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.310 align:start position:0%
seven days after birth sometimes it's 28
days

01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh do you how how do you define or how
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
does the department in this report
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
define the perinatal period
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
thanks for that question um since this
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
comes straight from the
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
death certificate information i i will
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'll have to go back and get the exact
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
definition for you but you're correct it
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
usually has some expansive number after
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh after birth so i'll follow up with
 
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.430 align:start position:0%
uh after birth so i'll follow up with
you

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
follow up and then you've got three
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
great contact lists of who the members
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
are yes it would be nice if you could
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
consider including um a point of contact
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
method if they are okay with email or
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
phone calls just in case somebody wanted
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
to reach out i will let them know thank
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative marsh uh yes thank you
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
this is a follow-up to representative
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
pearson's question has the funding for
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
genetic testing for sewage cases been
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
adequately addressed or do we need
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
further legislation for that
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
for genetic testing um i i don't know
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
that i can answer that fully right now
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to have an offline
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
conversation there's certainly no
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
funding through the department to do
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
that it would be a larger you know
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
obviously a much broader conversation um
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
among insurance carriers
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%

communicable diseases the pandemic has
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrated the importance of the role
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
of health officers to assess and improve
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
conditions and reduce the spread of
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%

prior to the pandemic
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
there was limited collaboration between

recommends that health

growing in the state
and

01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
we recommend that this committee take a
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
study of hoarding and determine the
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
extent and the impacts
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
of local health officials to respond to
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
these challenging situations
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
rental health is another issue
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
the residents in housing units result
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
from the inability of a landlord to
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
maintain maintain
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
the property from any other tenants who
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
may keep an unit in unsanitary
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
conditions health offices are often
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
limited by training testing skill
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
equipment to resolve these health
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
hazards and disputes
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
the association recommends the committee
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
review current laws including rsa 48a to
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
determine if adequate support to health
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
offices and their ability to assess and
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
resolve the rental housing units
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
workforce training
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the past health officers were
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
frequently appointed to their jobs by a
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
municipality with no public training or
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
background experience
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
this change with rsa 20 128 colon 11
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
specified minimum training health for
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
health offices and established a vehicle
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
for new health officer training as well
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
as continuing education let me interrupt
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
you there if if they are not required to
 
01:34:44.239 --> 01:34:45.109 align:start position:0%
you there if if they are not required to
have

01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
such training although that is being
 
01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.229 align:start position:0%
such training although that is being
addressed

01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
should they not be required to have in
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
the names of people in the immediate
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
area who are so if a local health
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
officer sees a problem knows it's a
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
problem doesn't have the training to get
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
in investigate it more fully there's
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
somebody immediately that they can go to
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
who will come in and do what's necessary
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
we have a list of health offices
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the area many who have years
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
of experience
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
there's a mentoring program which we can
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
call on to assist a health officer who
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
may need training in a particular side
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
project and of course dhhs is there to
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
support them
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
let me give you a follow-up
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
is there a mechanism whereby if a health
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
officer realizes he or she is in over
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
his or her head
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
and doesn't ask for help it just moves
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
on is there a mechanism to say sorry you
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
can't do that
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
at this point there's no mechanism in
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.239 --> 01:35:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
that really concludes my presentation
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and attention to
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
the important awareness
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
of public health
 
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
and we also have our members of dhsa
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
good morning representative pearson and
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um we were
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to do a presentation from the
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
department today dhhs i'm matthew kaling
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm a program manager with the within
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
public health and we did have a response
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
talking about solutions to the four
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
major problems you just heard about but
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
the proposal is that seeing where we've
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
got limited limited time and many
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
important things to talk today talk
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
about today we could defer our
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
presentation um off to april and happily
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
come back and address those uh some of
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
the solutions and if you'd like to ask
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
questions about the specific problems
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
and public health hazards we could
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
address those today with
 
01:36:53.679 --> 01:36:54.950 align:start position:0%
address those today with
wayne

01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
wayne
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
whitford from the association
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
i for one would like to see solutions to
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
the problem and what the legislature's
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
role may be in solving this because i'm
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
rather unhappy with what i've been
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
hearing i'm not unhappy with you guys it
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like you guys are paying
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
attention to it but i'm unhappy that
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're not there yet
 
01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:13.830 align:start position:0%
we're not there yet
i

01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
see our tentative schedule for april's
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
already pretty full
 
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.109 align:start position:0%
already pretty full
um

01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
even though the one who makes it is a
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
genius at shoehorning in incredible
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
amounts of stuff
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
still is a point
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh i would be
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
personally happy to
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh receive at least a report by email so
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
i can take a look at this right away
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
if you could send this through
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
mr edwards out to all of us on this
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful the report
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
was on readiness was delivered to the
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee today and it should be within
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
your packet
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
um it should be on the back of the
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
testimony that that the department dhhs
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
provided so we do have the report here
 
01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:59.669 align:start position:0%
provided so we do have the report here
um

01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
about state readiness report on local
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
health officers should be the lifting
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
and the title on the top so we do have
 
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
the reports okay there it is wow that
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
was quick it was it was we had someone
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
out earlier but i know that people are
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
busy and
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
they don't always receive these so the
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
report is here
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
and wayne has described the four major
 
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.109 align:start position:0%
and wayne has described the four major
um

01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
public health threats that are
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
challenging for health officers to
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
respond to okay i've got the threats i'm
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
as far along as that where's the
 
01:38:26.239 --> 01:38:27.350 align:start position:0%
as far along as that where's the
solution

01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
well the solutions are primarily in our
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
testimony but there are a couple of
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations i think that wayne put
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
forward which you're
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
welcome to discuss again
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
i would like that fleshed out i would
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
like each one of these four
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh problems fleshed out with
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
doable solutions that we can look at
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
i would suggest come up with that report
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
and send that to us i don't know when we
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
can talk to you face to face
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
but at least send us
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
answers to the four questions we do
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
within our testimony today from dhh have
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%

01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
we'd like that i'd like that fleshed out
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
more fully okay so for today you'd like
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
us to go back and work on those the the
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%

representative edwards i i
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh my english teacher

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:28.390 align:start position:0%
transmission hoarding rental housing
workforce

01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
when you summarize them in the
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion you're summarizing a
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
different four
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
and that's just an editorial comment
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody just reads the conclusion
 
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%

01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank thank you chairman pearson i i
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%

01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
this committee who's served as a health
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
officer for 20 years i i think that you
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
need to recognize
 
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.390 align:start position:0%
need to recognize
that

01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
department of health has
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
come a very long way
 
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
the institution of training for health
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
officers is a brand new thing we just
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
passed house bill
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
79 last year the department is
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
implementing that and i think having
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
training for health officers is going to
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
address a great deal of the concerns
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
that that you have heard i also want and
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like sophia to to elaborate upon
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
this they do a wonderful job at the
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
department both of making sure that the
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
health officers know what their
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are and what the limits
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
of their responsibilities are the health
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
officers are not appointed by the towns
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
they're nominated by the towns they're
 
01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
appointed by the commissioner and they
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
serve at her pleasure so if there is a
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
rogue person the commissioner can
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
address that um and i i think a great
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
deal of work has been done to to
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
address many of these problems before
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
they were even brought up and i would
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
like to give sophia a chance to explain
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of what she and matt
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
have been doing in the department to
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%

our program is responsible for managing
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
a private list serve so that is how we
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
communicate with all over 300 health
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
officers across the state we also
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
maintain a training manual
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
for health officers to help them
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
understand how to address different
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
sanitary conditions or concerns that may
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
arise in their town
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
example chapters of that health officer
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
manual include septic issues
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
sanitary conditions and day cares
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
water quality issues all of these types
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
of health concerns are addressed by the
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
local health officer
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to that manual and the list
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
serve messages we also engage in
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
generally two to four trainings every
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
year on specific issues that the health
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
officer would address
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
so we provide up until this point with
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
covid those trainings have been executed
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
via a
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
online platform but the new hampshire
 
01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:23.600 align:start position:0%

01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
because every year we have more data to
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
share with you and more information that
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
we feel is actionable both on a rural
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
health side and also on a workforce data
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
collection side just statutorily they
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
move those together so we cover both of
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
those items under one report
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
so all of the measures in our report are
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
assessing access delivery and
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
utilization of primary care specifically
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we also have some demographic data
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
that highlights population risk factors
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
that are associated with access to
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
primary care
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
all of the health status indicators in
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
the report are the ones where there is a
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
statistical difference between rural and
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
non-rural new hampshire as a highlight
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
that full list is an appendix a of the
 
01:45:38.239 --> 01:45:39.830 align:start position:0%
that full list is an appendix a of the
report

01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of the visualizations that are now
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
available in the report came from
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
upgrades to the dhh data dashboard there
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
is a rurality filter now available
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
where the data is applicable and it has
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
a color-coded significance that
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
immediately tells you if rural or
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
non-rural is statistically different for
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
that outcome indicator and also there
 
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
are numbers on a chart that drill down
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
by public health region to show if there
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
are any outlay outliers by public health
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
region for both the rural and non-rural
 
01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.790 align:start position:0%
region for both the rural and non-rural
status

01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna breeze
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
real residents more likely to be older
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
disabled low-income uninsured and
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
veterans than non-rural residents this
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
is consistent year to year as far as
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
population factors
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
the rates were highest in the north
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
country for all of these measures with
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
the exception of senior age and
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of uninsured in which carroll
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
county rates were the highest
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
the rate of non-fluent english speakers
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
is twice as high in non-rural new
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire than in rural
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
moving on to barriers of care
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
we show geographic disparities when we
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
look at travel so what we do is we look
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
at the percentage of the
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
visits that people took that took them
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
over 30 minutes to access primary care
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
as well as their median travel distance
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
and also whether or not they indicate
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
that they have a personal doctor or
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
health care provider
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
no surprise i'm sure to all of you the
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
travel times for rural populations
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
are uh
 
01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.149 align:start position:0%
are uh
80

01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
80
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
of them are longer than a non-rural
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
population to access that care
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
the ones that really stand out are
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee and carroll county public
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
health regions they have the highest
 
01:47:21.679 --> 01:47:22.390 align:start position:0%
health regions they have the highest
rate

01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the lowest
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
travel rates are greater manchester and
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
greater nashua
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
the percentage of new hampshire's rural
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
population that indicate they don't have
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
a personal doctor or health care
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
provider jumped by one-third between um
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
so from 13.7 percent to 18.1 percent
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
between last year's report and this
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
for substance use and mental health care
 
01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:48.709 align:start position:0%
for substance use and mental health care
we

01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
look at emergency department visits for
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
this and we look at the rates
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
of people using those emergency
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
departments for substance use or mental
 
01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.709 align:start position:0%
departments for substance use or mental
health

01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
around alcohol and drug related
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
emergency department visits
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
there is no geographic disparity between
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
rural and non-rural
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
on this particular rate which is
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
different from last year but when we
 
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
look at that there are some public
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
health regions that stand out as being
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
statistic statistically worse off and
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
that would be winnipesaukee and greater
 
01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:23.189 align:start position:0%
that would be winnipesaukee and greater
manchester

01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
and then conflicting with the trend of
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
improved rates of substance related and
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
self-harm ed visits
 
01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
non-rural suicide rates actually jumped
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
up in rate
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
for maternal
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
health we look at indicators around
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
whether there was no or late prenatal
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
care whether there was a post-term
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
delivery so 42 plus weeks or whether
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
people indicated they were smoking
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
during their pregnancy
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's no significant disparity um for
 
01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:52.149 align:start position:0%
there's no significant disparity um for
post

01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
post
 
01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
post-term delivery um and also for no or
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
late prenatal care rates except for in
 
01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.950 align:start position:0%
late prenatal care rates except for in
winnipesaukee

01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
um but also rural residents continue to
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
have higher rates of smoking during
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
pregnancy than their non-rural
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
counterparts and i can tell you that
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
this every single year we see that
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
particular indicator stand out and do
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
you cross that with level of education
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
that stat
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
we do not for this report but we work
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
with our tobacco program on talking
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
about some of the factors that that may
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
be driving what we're seeing as far as
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
our outcomes okay thank you
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
for preventive care
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
we look at things like colonoscopy and
 
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.589 align:start position:0%
we look at things like colonoscopy and
mammography

01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
mammography
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
um so this is one place where
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
winnipesaukee even though they don't do
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
well on some of those other things that
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
i've shared with you they do
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
very well they actually have the second
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
highest rate of mammography in the
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
entire state which is only one percent
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
lower than the upper valley
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
which is where dartmouth-hitchcock
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
medical center sits
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
the medical check-up rates increase for
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
both rural and non-rural populations but
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's still higher and non-rural
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
and there's no geographic disparity of
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
dental visits this year which we usually
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
do find that the non-uh the rural areas
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
have fewer dental visits than non-rural
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
but that is because the non-rural
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
residents are actually reporting more
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
that they don't visit the dentist so
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's evening out
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
but not in a good way not in an
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
increased access way
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
and then we have a section on outcomes
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
and these are prevention quality
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
indicators which used to be called
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
ambulatory care sensitive conditions so
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
there they would be reasons that people
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
would visit an emergency department
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
where the condition could have managed
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
been managed in primary care but became
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
a medical emergency and so we do look at
 
01:50:41.599 --> 01:50:42.470 align:start position:0%
a medical emergency and so we do look at
those

01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:43.510 align:start position:0%
those
and

01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
we have consistently found that the
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
chronic disease composite and the
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
overall composite for these pqis was
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
statistically higher in non-rural new
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire compared to rural
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
so in other words non-rural residents
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
were more likely to be admitted to the
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
hospital for preventable medical
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
complications than their rural
 
01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.350 align:start position:0%
complications than their rural
counterparts

01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
counterparts
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
why do you think that is
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
i i don't know exactly
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
i think what that indicates is that they
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
they may be being managed perhaps more
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
so even though they're traveling greater
 
01:51:21.589 --> 01:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
distances and they may not have a
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
personal doctor the ones that do have
 
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
that relationship and are doing that
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
access are taking advantage of things
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
like chronic disease care management
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
models and that's actually managing
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
their conditions where they are not
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
showing up in the rural emergency
 
01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:37.830 align:start position:0%
showing up in the rural emergency
departments

01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
for the late stage proportional rate of
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
breast cancer and rural is significantly
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
greater than in non-rural suggesting a
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
disparity in access and utilization of
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
primary care between the geographic
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
regions and there's no statistical
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
difference between the rates of death
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
from all causes by morality
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
a few of those public health regions do
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
stand out as having considerably higher
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
age-adjusted rates and those would be
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
the highest in winnipesaukee north
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
country and strafford county
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
so that's the rural data now we're
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
moving on to health work first data
 
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.510 align:start position:0%
moving on to health work first data
collection

01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
collection
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
you can see all of that information we
 
01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.589 align:start position:0%
you can see all of that information we
have

01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
since the first time we started
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
reporting to you in 2019 we have moved
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
from talking about the data collection
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
efforts which are done through the
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
renewal of licensing through the boards
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
as a part of a survey or opt-out that
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
are required as part of the renewal
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
we've moved on from talking about
 
01:52:35.199 --> 01:52:37.189 align:start position:0%
we've moved on from talking about
implementation

01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
to response rates to actually being able
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
to tell you what that data is showing so
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
on our web page we have each of the data
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
reports available by provider type that
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
go into all of the different sort of
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
nuances of what we're seeing based on
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
the data we collect
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then for this report what we do is
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
we roll up a few items that we think are
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
particularly significant and what we
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
also try to do is cluster together the
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
primary care providers so those are the
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians the primary care
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
physician assistants and the nurse
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
practitioners practitioners who provide
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
primary care together and look at them
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
and look at differences between each of
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
those provider types and also by
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
rurality and then we do the same thing
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
on the mental health side we put the
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists together with the mental
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
health practitioners the sud providers
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the men and the psychologists and we
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
roll those up and look at their
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
differences as well and we also look at
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
their reality so what we're looking for
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
in those aspects are differences in
 
01:53:36.639 --> 01:53:37.990 align:start position:0%
in those aspects are differences in
demographics

01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.109 align:start position:0%
demographics
training

01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
age groups
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
whether or not they had a tie to new
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire that may indicate why they're
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
practicing here training schooling
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
and then also
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
some retention indicators about where
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
where they think they're going to be in
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
the next five years
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
and then we provide all of that
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
information so that people can take
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
action around those various items
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
so one of the new things that we started
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
doing was trying to gauge the net change
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
of provider supply based on the
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
licensing lists
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
and so in here is a chart that covers
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
the number of license renewals that
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
we've had each year as an indicator of
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not our supply is going up or
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
down we're going to need to end this
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
because i have one more group to come in
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
sure so it it is all in there i am happy
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions like i said we
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
have all of our reports available as
 
01:54:31.599 --> 01:54:32.470 align:start position:0%
have all of our reports available as
well

01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
and if you have any particular areas of
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
interest we can definitely address those
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
as well i have one question it has to do
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
with the trends
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
rural to non-rural
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that rural population is
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
declining is that correct that is
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
correct is the rate of decline static
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
increasing or lessening
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i don't know
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
that yet so that would be based on the
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
census data that's just becoming
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
available and that's not quite available
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
to us in our dashboard but it's
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
definitely something that we can look
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
into it would be good and second
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
better availability of telehealth
 
01:55:15.199 --> 01:55:16.470 align:start position:0%
better availability of telehealth
medicine

01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
are some of the
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
rural parts of the state
 
01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:23.430 align:start position:0%
rural parts of the state
that

01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
present numbers
 
01:55:25.199 --> 01:55:26.229 align:start position:0%
present numbers
higher

01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
not having a pcp
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
is that moderating
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
we do not have data from the pandemic
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
yet okay um and actually
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
the way that we collect this is capacity
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
and in order to assess that we would
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
either need to wait for some sort of
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
outcome issue or another data collection
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
effort where people report access
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
but we can also look at that utilization
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
through claims data
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
how often do your people just drive
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
around and talk with doctors because you
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
know data's great so is boots on the
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
ground sure so we have a team that
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
focuses on critical access hospitals i
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
run a network connected to the rural
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
health clinics specifically we also work
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
with primary care and we um i vice chair
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
commission that meets every month on the
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary primary care workforce
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
we've been meeting since 2008 we just
 
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
met yesterday and that that is comprised
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
of a number of different provider types
 
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
as well as providers themselves
 
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
training and other folks and we just
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
presented actually danielle hernandez
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
from my office presented some reports
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday as well and we had a very
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
robust conversation about
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
making sure that we
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
continue to find out what's happening on
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
the ground from providers because that
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
that really does help us shape our other
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
workforce development programs
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful intersection when
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
eyes on the situation and data in the
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
computer can intersect it's my favorite
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
thing to do is to get out there
 
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
i like raising basset hounds any
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative nelson thank
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:57:01.589 --> 01:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
question i live in carroll county
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
southern carroll county
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
and we have several
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
good hospitals and services over in
 
01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:08.470 align:start position:0%
good hospitals and services over in
wolfeboro

01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
but a lot of my residents in our area go
 
01:57:11.119 --> 01:57:12.070 align:start position:0%
but a lot of my residents in our area go
south

01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
south
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
to stratford county
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
people are annoyed there because where
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
they go they've closed the clinic that
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
they had in carroll county
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
their doctors have lost
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
i think it's like 18 doctors have left
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
and it's all because of new ownership
 
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
and how they're being treated and so
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
when you look at your statistics the
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
people in my region who use those
 
01:57:36.239 --> 01:57:37.270 align:start position:0%
people in my region who use those
services

01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
either they've given up
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
and they don't go as often hopefully
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
they've gone over to wolfeboro where
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
they do a great job but
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
they're very upset and how
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
these types of hospitals can
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
with significant turnover
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know i can't believe somebody
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't oversee it but that's not your
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
issue thank you
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
we do have some workforce recruitment
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
and retention programs that i'm happy to
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
come back and tell you about as well to
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to stabilize some of
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
those relationships and those providers
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you the commissioner alluded to
 
01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
that a couple of meetings ago that's a
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful helpful thing
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
especially when it kicks in
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative murphy
 
01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question one of the questions
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
i would have and i was looking through
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
the rural data specifically
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
is do you have or could you put together
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
something similar to food insecurity
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
deserts a health care does it
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
so if you saw it on a map to say
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
the the paucity of primary care in
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
colebrook has just gone down immensely
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
so it'd be in a sense a visual to see a
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
healthcare desert
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
shown you know geographically throughout
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
the state so we could do that two ways
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
one of the ways is by rolling up the
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
fte so the full-time equivalents and
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
looking at that but also i'm doing
 
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
another project under our federal grant
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
where we're we are looking at a
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of different data to look at that
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
and what we want to do is identify where
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
healthcare should be not where it
 
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
already exists so that that is in
 
01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:10.470 align:start position:0%
already exists so that that is in
progress

01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your presentation
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
i've never seen a 44-page document
 
01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.189 align:start position:0%
i've never seen a 44-page document
so

01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
wonderfully thank you thank you
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
hi and i am marianne barter and i can be
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
very brief the child care advisory
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
council is made up of stakeholders and
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
entirely volunteer child care providers
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
who look to the lens of keeping child
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
care affordable and accessible in new
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and so what we do is we
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
are tasked with looking at child care
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
licensing rules dhhs rules things that
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
might be barriers to creating child care
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
businesses or keeping your child care
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
business going in in new hampshire we
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
also want to make sure that all children
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
can afford safe affordable child care
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
and that's not just something that can
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
be accessed by accessed by people with
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
strong economic resources
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
so we've been very busy during the
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic i think that child care is like
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
a really great bridge and you don't
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
notice a really great bridge when you're
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
driving over it until it crumbles and
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's sort of where we have been
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
and we've been very busy for the last
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
couple of years trying to build the
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of child care in the
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
state with our partners at dhhs
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
we are part of the b8 quadrant of the
 
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
council for thriving children we're part
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
of the workforce development groups
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
we had a subcommittee that looked at
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
child care licensing regulations
 
02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:20.149 align:start position:0%
child care licensing regulations
and

02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
we've had countless meetings
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
every other week we meet with over 100
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and child care providers to
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately i guess
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately the field is in trouble child
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
care in new hampshire is in trouble um
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
programs have closed since the beginning
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic and more than that rooms
 
02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
have closed so you may have your
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
neighborhood child care facility that is
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
still open and operating but it has half
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
the capacity that it used to in the past
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
really because of workforce and we've
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
had several other other groups present
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
today about their workforce shortages
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i guess my plea would be that if we
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
can solve the child care workforce
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
shortage we're going to solve an awful
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
lot of those child those workforce
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
shortages too
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
so um we really need we need help with
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but we also need
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
immediate help to keep reta to retain
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
our workforce and to recruit others to
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:02:32.719 --> 02:02:34.229 align:start position:0%
is there
recruitment

02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
or describe the recruitment to get child
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
care workers
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
right now there's almost none so so it's
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
individual businesses attempting to hire
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
we are working with our dhh partners to
 
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
create a
 
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
flow into the field which used to be the
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
high school cte programs when they moved
 
02:02:55.350 --> 02:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
to k-12 prioritizing k-12
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
it killed ch early childhood and the
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
effect on our field has been truly
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
detrimental and we've noticed it
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
accelerating over the past six years
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
so at this point we're rebuilding what
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
what was taken apart
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
um i am worried that
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
although i'm really excited about some
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
i mean some of the stuff that's
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
happening is amazing the teach program
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
the apprentice program but it will take
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
years to really rebuild that
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and we it we're desperate
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
to retain the staff that we have at this
 
02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:27.910 align:start position:0%
to retain the staff that we have at this
point

02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to let you know
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
that uh presently with the um arpa
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh what are called discretionary funds
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
um we are launching actually it's
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
starting next week um
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
a series of public service announcements
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted to the early
 
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
childhood in what we call out of school
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
time workforce which is after school and
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
before school
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
that'll be linked with what's called a
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
vanity url
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
into a job listing site um all of the
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
providers will be getting actually a
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
letter on monday morning about how to
 
02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
put their listings
 
02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
as well as we have a live person who
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
will be able to answer our phone so if
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
you have an interest in any aspect of
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
working in the child care field they'll
 
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
be able to direct you
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and we're in addition putting
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
together um in partnership with ccac um
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
what's called
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
a traveling recruiting booth
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
some of them are virtual some of them
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
are live
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
some of them were piloted for example
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
last year at the dear field fair now
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
that things are opening up you know
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're walking by you capture the
 
02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:33.270 align:start position:0%
you're walking by you capture the
audience

02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
audience
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
and talk to them about the different
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities and the career lattices
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
within the child care field as well as
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
promoting the programs that we have
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
which are apprenticeship internships
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a low barrier entry industry
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
in some ways but it also has amazing
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
career opportunities and so that's kind
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the picture that we're trying to
 
02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:56.870 align:start position:0%
of the picture that we're trying to
um

02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
to share is that
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
you may be a retiree and you want to do
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
it or you may be a high school student
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
and you're going to um try out the field
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
and find a career place
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
and diane is absolutely right i we have
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
to change the narrative that early
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
childhood education is a dead-end career
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
where you're going to go and you're
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to make 12 an hour for the rest of
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
your life that is no longer the reality
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
of our field and it's going to take i
 
02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:23.750 align:start position:0%
of our field and it's going to take i
think

02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
a paradigm shift of all of us to
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
understand that this field has changed
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
and we have responded to the low wages
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
we've responded to the educational
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
requirements and there are systems in
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
place to really build and grow our
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
workforce we just need to bring them to
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
us first and it's truly catastrophic
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
though it is i mean i could use i'm the
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
executive director of a child care
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
facility and
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'm licensed for 305 spaces but my
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
capacity due to my staffing is 137.
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
that has a huge impact on me it has a
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
huge impact on the families in concord
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that have been depending
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
on those 305 spaces for a very long time
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
so it is it is we are at a catastrophic
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
loss right now
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
my assumption is in the
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
old days
 
02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
the chief requirement
 
02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:16.790 align:start position:0%
the chief requirement
um

02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
to do child care is you didn't have a
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
prison record and you loved kids
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes and i'm now assuming that the
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more training along
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
the way am i
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
inferring correctly that there's entry
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
level and then after some further
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
training and years of experience or
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
months of experience there's a another
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
certificate that you can get which
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
presumably means a little bit more money
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
and responsibility and a little bit more
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
so there's la there's a ladder
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely there is a ladder and i think
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
that there's misconceptions about the
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
fact that um
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know you're
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
that you'll never be able to change your
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
position that your job will be entirely
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
working with toddlers for the rest of
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
your career there there is a ladder
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's room for change and there's room
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
for growth i mean i i think that
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
the future of early childhood education
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
is astounding you know there's attention
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
on this on the federal level there's
 
02:07:09.910 --> 02:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
never been before
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'm very worried about the next year the
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
next year is what i'm worried about
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
because as we continue to lose people we
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
cannot replace them if it takes eight
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
months to replace a preschool teacher
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
and you know that you are not replacing
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
them with nearly as good a preschool
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
teacher is left those are potentially 12
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
to 24 families that have been impacted
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
by that loss for an extended period of
 
02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
time so the child care advisory council
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
is very very worried about short-term
 
02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
is very very worried about short-term
investment

02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
investment
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
as fast as we can get it out there to
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that the people who are
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
hanging in there in the field hang in
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
just a little bit longer until we can
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
make it significantly better for
 
02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:47.830 align:start position:0%
make it significantly better for
everybody

02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
who does the education if there's
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
various steps where does one go yeah um
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
oh what what are the steps i mean
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's different positions you can
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
start an early childhood education with
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
just a love of children um no that's not
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
my question you're at this level
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
and you want to go up the ladder and get
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
a higher certificate better title
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
who teaches you to do that nhti or any
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the community
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
community college systems or the
 
02:08:15.030 --> 02:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
university system
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
and dhhs has tremendous financial
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
support for the field so if you are just
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
starting out and you want to advance you
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
can take a class for free they will pay
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
for it
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's usually several offerings so the
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
supports are there we just need to in
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
the short term draw and retain as many
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
people as possible so they can take
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
advantage of these supports and you've
 
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
got some public service announcements
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
rolling out to let everybody know what
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
you just told me that i didn't know
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
until you just told me
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and hopefully they will happen fast
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
they've been in the works since the fall
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay and so like anything else during
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
the pandemic everything takes forever so
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
we are truly hoping they will roll out
 
02:08:50.239 --> 02:08:51.189 align:start position:0%
we are truly hoping they will roll out
soon

02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
soon
 
02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
any questions to the presenter
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative mcmahon
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh ms barter uh
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
specific to the letter you provided
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
both your profession was provided uh
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
what's the status of the pilot program
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
to incentivize incentivize businesses
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
to support
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
education for their
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
employees children
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think it
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
changes business by business do you have
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
a pilot going yes we haven't uh we've
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
just in the preliminary planning stages
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
on how to implement that um and the
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
the the plan of attack if you will is to
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to initially launch a um an
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
employer survey to to do a query and
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
that should go in the next couple weeks
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
to every employer into the in the state
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
to say what are you doing around child
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
care as well as ask their employees
 
02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
and then from there craft the um an
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
incentive um pilot to find out what are
 
02:09:50.229 --> 02:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
working what things are working we have
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
everything in this state we have some
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
amazing models
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
um we have a an employer for example
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
that just bought a multi-million dollar
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
building that he's putting a child care
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
center in and he only needs 20 spaces
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
for his people but he's doing it for the
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
community um and then we have people
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
that are specifically have come to us
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
and said talk to us about job sharing
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
and how do we structure this in our
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
company so that we can have working
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
parents and um and they can job share
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
and watch each other's children how do
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
we set that up
 
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
so what we want to do is we find out
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
what models work
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then be turn around and be able to
 
02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
put our funds and our support in those
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate areas
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
then one follow-up follow-up follow-up
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh for either one of you ladies uh
 
02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
specific to the fact that the industrial
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
arts were not responding
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
to training on the front end
 
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
you have recommendations that's part of
 
02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
the as an offset of the pilot program to
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
bring that
 
02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:52.390 align:start position:0%
bring that
back

02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh to at the height i'm looking at the
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
high school level for for a job track
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
within those who have industrial uh the
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
industrial arts curriculum vitae
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
what's your thoughts on that
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
um we do so that is the absolute best
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
way to get people interested in our
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
field and to draw people who are born to
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
do this work into the work so absolutely
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
our cte partners are our most important
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
resource we're barely starting that work
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
now so we won't see the kind of the
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
fruits of this labor for three four
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
maybe five years because these kit we
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
have to develop the programs we have to
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
get the kids interested and then they
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
have to be able to get through the two
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
years of the program so that is a
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
long-term strategy that is going to be
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
game changing in the long term
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
and just one more clarification
 
02:11:41.119 --> 02:11:42.550 align:start position:0%
and just one more clarification
clarification

02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
as again specific to what you wrote on
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
where in 2015 the career pipeline was
 
02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
quote dismantled
 
02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
quote dismantled
uh

02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
to get things done while we're young how
 
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
quickly can this
 
02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:54.629 align:start position:0%
quickly can this
be

02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
how quickly could that be accelerated
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
over and above what you're already doing
 
02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.669 align:start position:0%
over and above what you're already doing
um

02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
certainly so there is a senate bill that
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
um has been amended recently 446 where
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
senator bradley has
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
tasked dhhs to work with child care
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
advisory council to
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
look at some of these things and get
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
them done quickly
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
i'm being optimistic about four years i
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
think it really these sort of programs
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to embed them in high
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
schools especially programs that had
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
them yanked away from them in 2015 it
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
will it's going to take time it will
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
take time to do it so in a perfect world
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
we'll get the programs up and running
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
within the next couple of years and then
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
we'll start seeing graduates from them
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
but i think that that's i would love to
 
02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
but i think that that's i would love to
be

02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
optimist more optimistic than that about
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
it but i just can't be i think it will
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
take that long thank you very much thank
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
you just clarify the term dismantled
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
what they did was they they turned
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
around and they didn't they didn't stop
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
recommending early childhood as a field
 
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
what they did is they shut down the
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
child care centers
 
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
shifted their resources to expanding
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
programming to include education careers
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
from what i say birth through high
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
school and so as a result where we had a
 
02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
real clear pipeline
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
that pipeline became very muddied um you
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
know you didn't have the child care
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
centers the kids doing the programs in
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
the school and going directly in and i
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
think um the wonderful part about it is
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
that the the high school folks that
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
we've met with are totally on board this
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
isn't we're not fighting any kind of
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
battle to do it um they're interested in
 
02:13:26.079 --> 02:13:26.709 align:start position:0%
battle to do it um they're interested in
it

02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i think they're i think
 
02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
for big programs sure it'll take a
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
period of time but i think we're i think
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have an opportunity to get some of
 
02:13:35.669 --> 02:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
those young people
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
internship and existing programs
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
um faster i'm hoping i'm i'm more
 
02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:43.530 align:start position:0%
optimistic yeah i
 
02:13:43.530 --> 02:13:48.229 align:start position:0%
optimistic yeah i
[Laughter]

02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
and it felt like a dismantling i mean i
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
had i run a large program in concord i
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
used to have 50 high school children in
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
my building every friday and now
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
i'm lucky if i can hire a kid after
 
02:13:58.800 --> 02:13:59.589 align:start position:0%
i'm lucky if i can hire a kid after
school

02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and with this we close
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
today's meeting of
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
oversight but not until
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
we have heard from the distinguished
 
02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:10.870 align:start position:0%
we have heard from the distinguished
senator

02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
um senate bill 446 was mentioned
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh that uh the changes to that to talk
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
about arpa funds
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
the department is the one that needs to
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
put the plan together to go forward in
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
our funds and i'm sure that mr williams
 
02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
can give us an update on that
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
and mr chair
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
not on that issue but on the committee i
 
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
have noted the attendance here in the
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
last half hour
