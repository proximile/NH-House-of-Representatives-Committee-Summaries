first we have uh House Bill
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
1178 we did have a work session on this
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh back on the 6th of March I see
 
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill here I believe
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment that's being
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
offered by representative Maguire and
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
grassie Amendment
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
1120h and either representative Maguire
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
did representative grassy work with me
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
our uh M Mr chair you would I have yet
 
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.309 align:start position:0%
our uh M Mr chair you would I have yet
another

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
amendment in the works right now uh
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
waiting for the the the ol blessing and
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
the but that would combine this text
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
with it yet another
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
tweak to make someone else happy so if
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
we wanted to say the Pledge of
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
Allegiance real
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
slow you know before we get going here
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
maybe that maybe my maybe the email will
 
00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
arrive but I can describe for you what
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
it does in addition to
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
this first before you move forward I
 
00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
guess a question for representative
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
Maguire and grassy I think of a
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
different we have we have another one
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
right so per the email discussion I have
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
copies of um representative
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
infant's yeah
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
infantine that's a different amount okay
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm confused okay so
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative infantine asked for a
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
different Amendment which he told me he
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
would be here to talk about but he's not
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what to do and this is
 
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what to do and this is
on

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay but I don't think I
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
didn't but
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and I'm the chairman of
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
the labor committee and I have been on
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
the labor committee for the last 16
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
years you know it's
 
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
really something to say about
 
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:17.959 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge over the years
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
of being on the committee you realize
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
what is things that the labor committee
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
should be doing and things they
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
doing there's a myriad of different
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
businesses out there and we think of the
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
most simple someone that works at a a a
 
00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
gas station um a real estate agent a
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
doctor a nurse you know all these
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
different things but there's all kinds
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
of goofy jobs out there that you don't
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
really think about and because those
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
jobs are tailored to sometimes the
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
Seasons businesses have to come up with
 
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
their own ideas as how to deal with that
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
right now in the North Country right now
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
the snow's going away
 
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
it's mud season some people have to get
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
laid off for a certain period of time
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
until it's time for the spring and the
 
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
summer activities there's a company in
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester that makes chocolate and they
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
close down every June to retool their
 
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.750 align:start position:0%
close down every June to retool their
entire

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
Factory paving companies make decisions
 
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
during the year to withhold some of
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
their wages from their
 
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
employees at the employees uh um in
 
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.949 align:start position:0%
employees at the employees uh um in
agreement

00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
so when they're off in two or 3 months
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily have to get
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
unemployment which as we all know
 
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay 35 or 40% of your lost
 
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
income so businesses have to make these
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
changes that affect you
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
know what what their business model is I
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
let all my employees off at 1:00 on
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
Fridays because we don't get any phone
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
calls one person stays behind and
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
everyone gets a nice long weekend these
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
are just decisions that businesses make
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
so we're very careful when we try to
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
make law that it doesn't affect this
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
this narrow band of what you think is is
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
a standard business because there's all
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
kinds of things out there um that you on
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
a daily basis you don't really realize
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
what other other businesses are doing so
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
we like to let the employer make some
 
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
decisions within reason obviously for
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
safety and other
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
things so when we make these decisions
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
are we pigeon ho holding a company into
 
00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
something are we making them do what the
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
legislature wants versus what's tailored
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
for their
 
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
business this bill has come in front of
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
the committee six or eight times in the
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
last eight or nine years and every time
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
I try to work with the um the sponsor
 
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
who I respect for continuing to push the
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
way he does to try to get something
 
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
passed there are two circumstances which
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
we have heard that I feel is something
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
that be is fair to both the employer and
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
the employee and that has to do with
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
when um a business
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
closes well there's no other way to get
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
some of those extra
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
benefits that they have AC crude time so
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
there should be a mechanism there how
 
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
about secondly when a business is sold
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
to another business and that business
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's purchasing them does not accept
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
that that um earn time those are two
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
things the sponsor of the bill and I
 
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.110 align:start position:0%
things the sponsor of the bill and I
agree

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
on those are circumstances that are
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
unique enough that I feel that it's okay
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to make some
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
decisions but the way the current bill
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
is drafted I have a couple problems with
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
it number one I think it preempts Union
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
contracts I think it preempts uh
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
people's procedures manual and I don't
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
think we should be doing that so I've
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
tried to come up with an amendment that
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
hits those two
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
items doesn't deal with the un uh
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
unemployed uh people that uh
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
um for some reason the company says we
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
have to have a
 
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
layoff and you don't know whether you're
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
going to come back on and up by and
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
large people do bring them back but
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of things that anyone
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
would ever think in this room that Co
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
was going to
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
happen or you know so things
 
00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:23.759 align:start position:0%
happen so I'm trying to to my Amendment
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
tries to take the items that I feel are
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
the most
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
important those two we men the only
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
other change I made and and not this is
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
arbitrary I tried to split the
 
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
difference here between people who
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
wanted employers no more than 15 or 15
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
employers or less other people wanted 25
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
I split the difference in 20 I
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
understand there are other things in New
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law that 15 is consistent I
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
really don't care either
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
way but the the the real problem I have
 
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.509 align:start position:0%
way but the the the real problem I have
is

00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
when making some arbitrary comments like
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
well well when there's no reasonable
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
expect ation that you might be
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
reemployed I mean that when you're
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
sitting here and say you're all hearing
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
officers for the Department of Labor how
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
do you adjudicate that kind of language
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
and we try to be very
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
specific in the labor committee as
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
president of Broody knows full well for
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
his many years on the committee try to
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
make it so you don't have such an
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrary thing for Department of Labor
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
hearing officers to try to have to
 
00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:23.949 align:start position:0%
hearing officers to try to have to
figure

00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:23.959 align:start position:0%
figure
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
out so that is my stance um on this bill
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
the things that I feel that it would be
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh for the legislature to
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
come down and and say that this is
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate and this is fair another
 
00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
thing I've learned over my years of of
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
sitting here in the legislature is I do
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
not like to pass legislation for the
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
sake of passing legislation in New
 
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
hampsh in in in the house when I know
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
full well it probably has no
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
chance um I know we don't have to worry
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
about the other side of the wall and all
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
so I I I don't want to pass anything
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's not going to have a chance of
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
becoming law it just it's kind of a
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
waste of everyone's
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
time you take questions yes I'm happy to
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire fall B represent
 
00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
Kimbrell uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
you representative for coming um we've
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
talked you you mentioned to me
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
previously about a seasonal employment
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
how does this affect that is is and is
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
that a problem with the current bill I
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
believe the current bill does have a
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
problem with seasonal employment because
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
of that whole that concept of reasonable
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
expectation of when you'll be um brought
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
back we're going to have hey ice out we
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
just broke the record by one day okay um
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
I've already you know I know people are
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
already hey let's get the boat ready
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
know let's let's get let's get things
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
moving skis are away let's start doing
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
the things that that we want to do we
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
never know from any year what's going to
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
happen the asphalt plants are going to
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
be open earlier this year a light mud
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
season construction is going to start
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
earlier so you never know any given time
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
and what happens if it takes uh 6 weeks
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
versus four weeks to retool that
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
chocolate factory in Manchester and and
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
people are out for a little longer than
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
expected so you know because of uh our
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
seasonality because of our weather
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
obviously you know you never know as an
 
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.110 align:start position:0%
obviously you know you never know as an
employer

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
I think this pigeon holes a little bit
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
sorry represent cell thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for that
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
clear concise presentation I have been
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
one who have has opposed this bill for
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
the past several years but I can tell
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
you that I agree with everything you
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
said and that I can support this
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
questions I do have one often we we get
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
criticized here in finance because we're
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
a policy committee with a little p
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
versus the policy committee that you
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
chair and U just want to caution
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
everybody that all these bills coming in
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
these Amendments have nothing to do with
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
Finance of the state cers like this
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
amendment here is a policy change so
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
again just a reminder this bill did go
 
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
before the house came out of the
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
committee as a 1010 split I believe
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
correct and then there was a Voice vote
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
on the house to uh support an amendment
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
which did pass and there was a Voice
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
vote to uh pass it back I think on
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
February 22nd so I agree with you um you
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
know the way I was always taught uh when
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
it comes to finance it's about financial
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
and it's not a policy so that's why I
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
was reticent to kind of bring this in
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
from a finance standpoint if this
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
affects the state and the and the
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
municipal um and you have that uh
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph in there about reasonable
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
assumption uh you could possibly have
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
people who work for the uh any
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
municipality that may be laid off for
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
any certain period of time that could
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
um utilize that clause and and try to
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
get whatever um um unused earn time or
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
whatever they have and of course as you
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
know State and
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities when they pay out workers
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
compensation they must reimburse
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment Securities so there is
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
potential cost
 
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.470 align:start position:0%
potential cost
there

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions yeah
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
Melissa please I just wanted to make a
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of a clarifying statement
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
that this actually this RSA does not
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
pertain to state or Municipal Employees
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
they are exempt from this RSA well thank
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
you it does impact um the university
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
system though that was my not my
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
understanding but thank
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
you I have heard from uh employers of
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
the state that are quite concerned that
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
the state has removed themselves and yet
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
the state is pushing legislation that
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
will affect businesses and the state
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't follow their own advice so just
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
that that's out
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
there that that is common theme uh in
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
the committee as well labor committee as
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
you are there any further questions for
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
the representative from Manchester
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
seeing represent Bui have a question I
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
see a reaching for the mic not really
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
but I think if the state of New
 
00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:23.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sells the business that uh the
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
new state should take it over
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you all right we do have an
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
amendment on the floor is uh anyone
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
interested in moving it along
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
um 1047 AG but should we hear from
 
00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.990 align:start position:0%
um 1047 AG but should we hear from
represent

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
first I thought there was an agreement
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
but representative K representative kill
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
you don't like this amendment I I do
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay could you please come forward then
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
we'll hold off on the amendment I thank
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
you misunderstood I thought there was
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
kind of an agreement among the parties
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
on this but apparently not no yes thank
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh Michael Cahill
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham 10 the
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
communities of newfields and New Market
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
and yet another amendment hot off the
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
press still warm the um as you may
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
recall we we did have an ISS that we
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
discovered after passing the house that
 
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
the uh the issue trying to accommodate
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
the seasonal employers was a little bit
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
too open where there was we forgot to
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
put in the language that it was a
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
layoff and so that's been addressed here
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
but combined with that we have put in a
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
cap of 30 days for the amount of time
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
time that would be reimbursed and that's
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
is because as uh uh representative
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
grassy alluded to earlier uh you
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
University New Hampshire has an
 
00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:00.789 align:start position:0%
University New Hampshire has an
extremely

00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799 align:start position:0%
generous uh package a program that they
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
use when someone is laid off and we
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
don't we certainly don't want to harm
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
people who are already being well taken
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
care of by by minimizing that but what
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is take care of the
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
people who with this rather broad brush
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
of a we don't pay uh upon termination we
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
don't pay vacation time that's rather
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
broad brush that that impacts people who
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
can least afford
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
it and that's why I object to uh the
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
amendment from the gentleman my chairman
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
of my committee with whom I've worked on
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
this issue for many years because his
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
Amendment removes people who are laid
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
off which I think is the more likely of
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that could occur uh
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
yes a business is sometimes sold and a
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
business sometimes is closed but uh a
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
layoff is something that may happen a
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
few times during the course of a
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
business it could happen and when the
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
person is laid off uh they do go and and
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
file a claim for unemployment and if
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
they have if they've been paid vacation
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
their vacation time that they earned uh
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
then the claim will be delayed
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
protecting the education the sorry the
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh the uh unemployment trust fund and
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
giving them really what they've earned
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
what they're entitled to what what was
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
what they were offered and what they've
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
acquired AC Creed or not over during the
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
course of their employment and again
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is this as this is well the uh
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
other other circumstances is it no fault
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
to the employee and they should not uh
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
lose what they've earned because because
 
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
some things are slow with the business
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever is happening so uh that is
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
why I'm hoping that you will pass this
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
amendment uh 20241 256h which combines
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
both of the fixes that this bill needs
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
to once again pass the house and I
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
believe perhaps pass the Senate as
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's no longer the language that
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
allows for someone to be paid uh because
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
they have given proper notice and work
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
their notice and leaving on good terms
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
that was removed that was that was an
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
impediment for some and
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh Mr juv is here for the business
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
and industry Association we I also have
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh a good uh neutral from the U
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and I believe uh
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
usnh will be happy that I've added this
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
30-day cap that was their that was their
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
remaining objection so it's been it's
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
been altered to accommodate as many
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
people as possible and again the number
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
of people as I as I provided to you with
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
information from the uh Economist at the
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
employment security that basically 84%
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
of the Employers in New Hampshire will
 
00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:50.919 align:start position:0%
not be affected by
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
this because that number 15 which again
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
I showed you has several different uh
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
similar triggers s events uh raising it
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
to 20 maybe that'll maybe that'll only
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
cover uh 82% I don't know but I think
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
that I think uh the L with the the 15 is
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
is a good number it was provided to me
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
by the former Deputy Commissioner of
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
labor for those reasons because it was
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
not a new number for for employers to
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
deal with the uh small companies uh
 
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
under 15 employees are are exempt and
 
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.950 align:start position:0%
under 15 employees are are exempt and
the

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh the uh
 
00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
it is now clarified because if the
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
business Clos change ownership or a
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
layoff with no reasonable Assurance now
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
I know that my my good friend Mr infant
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
time was struggling with this thing
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
about seasonality and we talk about
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable you know does is H is ice out
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
a factor in your returning to work well
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
okay ice out has happened I'm sure the
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
employee isn't going to demand all their
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
back pay or their vacation because
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to be working uh a week
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
later or a week ear you know
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
people are
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable and and I think uh that's
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
that takes care of the uh the the
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
concern with the paving as you don't
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
know when spring is here today but it
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
might not be here tomorrow because we're
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but you know people are
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable if you're going back to a job
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
because you know and you intend to go
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
back the employer intends to hire you
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
you're not going to make a fuss because
 
00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:21.559 align:start position:0%
something was off a little
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
bit uh I also want to tell you that if
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
you do file a claim uh with employment
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
with the U Department of labor the the
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
claimant has the burden to prove you
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
have to prove that you were that the
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
policy or the practice was or the law
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
was not followed it's it's not an easy
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
task uh you have to have records you
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
have to have that everything in order
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
and uh where where someone is laid off
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
uh they haven't been collecting all
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
these records perhaps you know but the
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
layoff a layoff enough a layoff as it is
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
should be should be enough to guarantee
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
that you'll receive what whatever time
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
you had coming to you that You' work to
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
earn with the understanding that that
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
was part of your package part of your
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
employment you get this wage you get
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
This Much Vacation whatever whatever
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
they're calling it and we're excluded
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
the sick days because I never intended
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
for six days to be reimbursed because we
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
hope you don't get sick but the
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
employers do want you to take the
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
vacation to use the time to be refresh
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
be productive and it's an offered as
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
something to retain workers it's not
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
intended I I don't think is something
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
that I can hold on to in case the person
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
leaves and I've got this much more money
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
than I had than I would have had if I
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
have actually paid them what I was
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to pay them uh if you have a if
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
you have a small if you have a business
 
00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:44.919 align:start position:0%
like this I think you have a small
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
business indeed but uh so I urge you to
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
pass this amendment and we'll go back to
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
the floor or in the alternative like
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
I'll bring it as a floor Amendment and I
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
think the votes are there because uh we
 
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about you know Workforce and
 
00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh not many Workforce people
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
in the legislature but working people of
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
a working class have either seen this
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
happen or they seen it not happen and
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
they know that this is the right thing
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
to do so I think I think either way it
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
will pass on the floor I'd rather have
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
it coming out of this committee amended
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
than do that and that's what I'm asking
 
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
you to do
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
today are there any questions for
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
representative kale and I again just
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
reminding the committee uh when we took
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
up this bill we heard there was going to
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
be one simple Amendment but we now have
 
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.549 align:start position:0%
be one simple Amendment but we now have
three

00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
amendments uh so those of you that have
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
come for other meetings or hearings I
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
apologize for the delay uh represent
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
Maguire yeah I'll just State and I I
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
would hope that representative grassy
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
would agree that this latest Amendment
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
from representative kahill is an
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
improvement over the one we created for
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative kill so so we can ignore
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
the one that has my name on it I
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
think yeah this this is the combination
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
so all
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
good yeah good okay see so that means I
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
may not have to Fe on all right let me
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
let me um ask a question
 
00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
so technically what does the word does
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
the word layoff apply if if somebody say
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
like a ski instructor and the ski season
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
ends and and maybe they would come back
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
to work next year as a ski instructor
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
and maybe not who knows um is that a
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
layoff or is that something else I I I'm
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
not sure if ski instructors get vacation
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
time as it is a seasonal thing and I
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
know there's something strange in the
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
law an exception for people working at
 
00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:47.559 align:start position:0%
ski resorts oh I I can't put my finger
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
on it right now but it is something
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
resorts I used to be a ski instructor
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
myself so I can probably answer the
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
question and bus dri school school bus
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
drivers and ski instructors well I used
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
to teach skiing at Temple Mountain
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
before they closed in Peterboro Temple
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
and we used to be able to ski anywhere
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
in the country for free that was one of
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
our benefits but we did not get any
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
layoff for right vacation time and I
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
think Mr chairman as you've been here
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
longer than I you may recall a time when
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
when uh Representatives could skeg and
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for free at least at the
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
state own places yes we changed that all
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
right so maybe skiing is somehow special
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
so so let me try something else you you
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
work at an ice cream stand right and
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's the end of Summer and the ice cream
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
stand closes for the winter right is
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
that a layoff or is that something else
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
um well it if you have the if you okay
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
you are I guess it's a layoff or it's
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
just closed for the season you can say
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
the business closes I don't think people
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
working on ice cream stands are getting
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
vacation time but if they did I bet that
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
employer would pay them because they
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
went they went through the trouble of
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
offering that vacation time so they'll
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
all be scooping and not uh not looking
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
for people to do that so I mean maybe
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
the manager gets some something I don't
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
know the manager yeah the manager may
 
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
get or maybe he goes uh to another
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
operation in the warmer climate and
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
Scoops ice cream there all right or
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
becomes a ski instructor I don't
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
know represent grassy would you like to
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment yeah yeah
 
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
certainly and I and I and I think that
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at and and some of
 
00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
the these seasonal businesses a lot of
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
place they don't have vacation time
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
because you're on your vacation time
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
when the season ends and and so this
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
only deals with the crude time and this
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
is something that I personally
 
00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:44.919 align:start position:0%
experienced when covid hit uh it hit in
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
March my business the business that I
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
worked for shut down those what the
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
first year you worked for the company
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
you got no vacation time your vacation
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
time AC Creed in January so on January
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
1st you got your first week or your two
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
weeks or your three weeks which I happen
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
to have been at at that time and those
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
people that took their vacations between
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
January and March 15th got their
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
vacation time those people who didn't
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
which I was one had three weeks vacation
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
was planning on taking it in August got
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
nothing didn't get a check for the
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
vacation time which was a crew that I
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
had worked the whole previous year to
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
get got
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
nothing so that's what this bill is
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
attempting to
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
address that those people who work it
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
the crude vacation time would be in your
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
policy most seasonal businesses don't
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
have that so this addresses a crude
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
vacation time that's offered by
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
businesses if the businesses don't offer
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
vacation time then there's nothing there
 
00:32:51.629 --> 00:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
out uh yes representative kill quickly
 
00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
please because I'd like to uh recognize
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
a gentleman from the bi I oh I recognize
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
him too I think I'm glad to see him here
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so yes I just wanted to
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
clarify you know you're just looking at
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment but the bill itself is
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
only to employers of 15 or more who
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
offer vacation pay time off so if you
 
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
have 20 employees and you don't offer
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
vacation you might find it harder to
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
keep people but you know you at least
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
you don't have to pay their vacation so
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
and so the bill is really finally
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
finally tuned with I think everything I
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
can think of at the present time to
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
please very ious entities and I ask you
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
to pass the amendment and the bill I
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
testimony and if you could please state
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
your name for the record please thank
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for the record my name is
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
Dave ju I'm senior vice president for
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
public policy with the Bia I I fear my
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
comments May further confuse the
 
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.710 align:start position:0%
comments May further confuse the
committee

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.470 align:start position:0%
committee
but

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
bia's preference frankly would be that
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
you don't do anything that you don't
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
legislation um we were neutral on
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative K Hill's
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
proposal um because in the spirit of
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
kindness and fairness we wanted to try
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
to find some middle ground for those
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
employees who through no fault of their
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
own um had a crude time that they never
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to use use we didn't
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
support the bill but we didn't oppose it
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh we do recognize it creates some
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions and will likely create some
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
disputes and part of the reason for all
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
the Amendments is to try and uh nail
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
down the language in such a way that
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
it'll reduce the disputes um in terms of
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
Representative infantine bill I think um
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
that would be closer to what the Bia
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
would have ultim wanted which is nothing
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
at all it certainly takes away the
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
question about uh layoffs um and will
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
only affect those businesses that either
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
permanently close or are sold to a new
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
owner and the owner won't recognize the
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
acred time um so from that sense I would
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
say that's the better of the two
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
amendments but it's only from our
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
perspective which is we would have
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
preferred not to see any legislation at
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
all happy to answer any
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
for coming so what would you say to
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative grass's personal
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance um what happened to him
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
when he was laid off um well I think
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
that illustrates part of uh what could
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
be the confusion that will result from
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
the legislation and again we're neutral
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
on representative K Hill's proposal for
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
example um many businesses including the
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
ones the one that I work for was shut
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
down by executive order during the early
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
days of covid we continued to get paid
 
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
because in my case I was able to work
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
remotely and other employees from other
 
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
businesses around the state got paid
 
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
because of the um the uh payroll
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
Protection Program and if they didn't
 
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
get that uh for example my wife didn't
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
get it she was employed but she was able
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
to file for unemployment and was able to
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
receive essentially the full amount of
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
her salary because of the federal
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
additions to the unemployment
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
benefit um in many cases those
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that were shut down opened up
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
again once they were allowed to and all
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
those individuals who were
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
employed were employed again so
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
um again the question
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
is if they were laid off was that for a
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh with a reasonable expect expectation
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't be reemployed and I
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
would suspect most of the businesses
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
where that happened they were assuring
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
their employees that once we're able to
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
open again we'll want you to come back
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
for work but I think everyone recognizes
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of grayness to that
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
um we all have different uh concepts of
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
what reasonable is but In fairness to
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
represent of Cahill uh we did think
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
there was some fairness to try to deal
 
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
with employees who were laid off
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
permanently uh and never had the
 
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
time so just so I'm clear the bill that
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
came out and was amended by the house
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
back in February you're okay with that
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
but you oh no not okay with that at all
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
no we were absolutely not okay with that
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
we think the amendment the floor
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that passed in the house
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
opened up the door so that any
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
individual whose employment was
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
terminated for any reason could uh would
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
be required to receive the uh acred but
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
unused time we ABS I don't think that
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
was the intent of the sponsor of the
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment but that's what the
 
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.750 align:start position:0%
 
did

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair again at at the end
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
of the day and I know we're not supposed
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
to talk policy but I believe like uh
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
even in the representative's case over
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
here when he took that job he would have
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
known what the policy was and if he
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
didn't get uh vacation that would have
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
simply been the company's policy um so
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
again uh I I would I I would prefer no
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
bill but if we must go forward again I I
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
can support Port representative in
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
STI okay we do have a hand waving back
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
there again I remind everyone we're way
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
behind schedule not no fault of anyone
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
sitting out there but all
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
H representative grassy has a question
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
yeah just just a comment because was one
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
of the things that was said is that when
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
you get laid off you does it tend to get
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
hired again the company that I worked
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
for was closed down quite a while
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
because of covid when they came back
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
they hired a number of employees back
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
those employees all started off as as
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
new employees they did not get any of
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
the acred time that they had held before
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
they did not get any of the the other
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
benefits that they had they started off
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
with zero vacation time as and everybody
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
started off at the base so their ACR
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
time which they had earned was lost and
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
fair all right I have a response
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
to no respon
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
okay there is a motion on the floor was
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
moved by represent cell and seconded by
 
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.190 align:start position:0%
moved by represent cell and seconded by
represent

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
anyway the clerk does have yeah I I just
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
wondered under your circumstances then
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative grassy do you not support
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
the infantine amendment uh certainly
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
because it takes layoffs out of the
 
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
equation and layoffs I think is the most
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
important thing you have here when
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
people are laid off and it may go beyond
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
a period of time um you know if the
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
place has maybe closed down for a year
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
or two years if they're hiring the
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
employees back if there's a reasonable
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
expectation of getting rehired I have no
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
problem with it as long as your benefits
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
are kept there so that you can get your
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
benefits but once those once they take
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
that acrude time away from you that
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
you've earned that's a problem and and
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
what happened is after four years when
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
they finally reopened they basically
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
said we're not honoring any previous we
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
have new Personnel policy you all come
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
in as new employees so it wasn't really
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
a it was a layoff but then it was a
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
termination at some point and because
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't bring any of those employees
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
back they owed us the
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
time I would oppose the
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
amendment let me get my well she's
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
getting set up I'm going to mix up the
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
voting a little bit representative wer
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
will be going first from now on as a
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
senior member of the finance committee
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I just think that's more appropriate
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
that so that's we change things up just
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.790 align:start position:0%
revised fiscal note just no amendment to

bill all right we do have a revised
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%

1666 thank you it's been moved and
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative
 
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.950 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative
[Music]

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%

that say something if you want to say
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
something yeah so this is this seems to
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
be just a one-time cost for um for
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
computers updates so it's not I think
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
originally came out had more expense but
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
this is fairly minimal
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you so for the clerk um it was

ballots Aaron you have anything to on
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
this one or do we also have a
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh I don't see a new fiscal
 
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:04.799 align:start position:0%
note Melissa uh this hearing was just
 
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
continued from last week I believe
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire was hoping or may
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
have worked with represent or with sorry
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
with Miss Hennessy on this bill but
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's no amendment to revise fiscal
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's just a continuation of the hearing
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
repres McGuire so I do want to amend the
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill but I don't I don't have the exact
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
language ready so this bill um the the
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
main Pro the main fiscal financial
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
problem with it is it wants to it it
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
requires an ongoing $100,000 Plus for a
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
new employee and at the Secretary of
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
State's office and and in particular
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
what it asks the Secretary of State to
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
do is gather the memory cards from these
 
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
voting machines which are located in the
 
00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:52.799 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then have an employee
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
display play the what's on the cards to
 
00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
display play the what's on the cards to
interested

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
parties um and and that's what the
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
partially what the employee is for so
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
what I have in mind for an amendment is
 
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
to leave the memory cards with the
 
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and allow them to um to
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
sell copies of those cards to any
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
interested parties for their
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
costs um of making the making the
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
duplicated cards so um and just let it
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
go with that and and the the interested
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
parties can can then access the
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
information on their own time with their
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
own computer equipment and so on um it
 
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.470 align:start position:0%
own computer equipment and so on um it
does

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
um now the Secretary of State I think
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
might argue and and did last time that
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
that they're not in favor of well maybe
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't but maybe you should explain
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
but but they don't like the idea
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily of of making the the cop the
 
00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
pictures of the ballots just open right
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
so that so that um they're easily
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
identifiable and so on to me you know I
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
think we're in this age where where
 
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:22.839 align:start position:0%
everything should be open and and um the
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
whatever downside there is to doing that
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
is very minor compared to the upside of
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
having open and and transparent
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
elections and so on now um the bill
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
itself does not allow full auditing of
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
Elections because there are always
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
hand-counted ballots and so the handc
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
counted ballots are not on the memory
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
cards but that wasn't the sponsor's
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
intention as I understand it so so
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's my thought is is take the money
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
out of the bill by just saying to towns
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
look if somebody wants want a copy of
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
the memory card you need to copy it and
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
give it to them and you can charge them
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:12.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
Aon thank you Mr chair Aon Hennessy
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state uh I've been
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
working with representative Maguire on
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
some questions he had about the
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
different memory cards of the two new
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
devices that the bout law conditionally
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
C uh conditionally CER certified one is
 
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
actually um received the conditions to
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
be used met the conditions to be be used
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire elections the other has
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
not yet but is working towards that um
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
one of the devices has a off-the-shelf
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
USB memory card um that would be able to
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
be the images would be able to be viewed
 
00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
per discussion with the vendor um if you
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
on your home computer it just might take
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
a little while to view each one the
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
other I am working with the other vendor
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
to figure out what would be needed in
 
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
order to number one copy those memory
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
cards because they are not offshelf
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
memory cards and I don't
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
know um I don't know if they are the
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
type of memory card that someone could
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
plug into a USB or a USC or a normal
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
port with that a normal person has with
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
a computer um so I'm working to get
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up answers on that as well as um
 
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
answers representative
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
wer thank you Mr chair hello eron uh if
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
we would to change this bill so that for
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
full disclosure you wouldn't deal with
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
any company that had something special
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
that couldn't be easily
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
copied how would that affect things you
 
00:53:50.789 --> 00:53:50.799 align:start position:0%
know it obviously we want to have some
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
familiarity and have
 
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
everybody able to get things you know
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
you could Mark the ballot but do not
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
make any marks that
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
can you know identify the
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
individual so that somebody makes some
 
00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
stupid Mark that oh that's so and so the
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
town idiot that did that and you know
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
everybody would
 
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
know he always draws the same face on
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
but you know other than that you know I
 
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
think for full disclosure we've had so
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
much in my mind cheating on ballots that
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
I would like full disclosure Ure and I
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
would I would be tempted to put it in
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
your amendment
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
that no machine could be used that was
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
too complicated to have the the uh
 
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.109 align:start position:0%
too complicated to have the the uh
reader

00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
reader
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
copy is that a
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
question so you I think you would have
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
to change um a lot more sections of the
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
law and the process by which uh
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting devices are
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
approved by the ballot law
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
commission we can do
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
that it's it is your
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
legislative um opportunity to do
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
that representative grassy a question I
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
have you saying these cards that they
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
have are specific to the machines right
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
they're proprietary is that correct for
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
correct for one of the vendors okay if
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
they were not proprietary would that
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
open them up to possibly
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
Mischief thank you for the question so
 
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
the coding of the um of the um election
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
on the non proprietary USB um that is
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
used for a specific election if that
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
coding were to be changed then um it
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
would corrupt the data and the device
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
would not would know that it was changed
 
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
so there's some fancy computer stuff
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
going on in there that would not allow
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
somebody to change the coding on that um
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
you could still view the images of the
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
ballots you just can't change anything
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
so that somebody couldn't try and tamper
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
with an
 
00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.710 align:start position:0%
with an
election

00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you Mr chairman
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
so um first of all I want to point out
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
that this bill only allows the
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
information to be distributed after the
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
final date for the election so that it
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
cannot affect the election the election
 
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
results are known and all that sort of
 
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
stuff it's only for afterwards correct I
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's only for after the recount
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
period yes yes so that's that's the end
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
right so yeah is or is it not the end um
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
I I always hope it's the end all right
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
fine and then
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
secondly what I'm going to propose is
 
00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:39.799 align:start position:0%
let's say some Town buys the the
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
nonproprietary non um public machine
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
right the the one with the proprietary
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
memory card well
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
presumably they could still sell copies
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
but it would be a lot more expensive
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
because they would go to the company and
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
say make me a copy of this proprietary
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
memory card and so they would tell the
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
the person who wants to buy it okay I
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
can do it for you but I'm going to need
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
$11,000 because that's what this company
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
charges right and so if that's
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to the election law
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
committee or whatever let them make
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
those those extensive changes saying
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
such a machine can't be used but I don't
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
think we're ready to to to make those
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
changes right
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
so yes response yeah uh thank you I I
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
also wasn't asked this but I do want to
 
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
point out that the um house election law
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
did unanimously pass this week a
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
post-election audit bill so that puts
 
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
back into law the post- elction audits
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
that were done previously in New
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at our last general election
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
um and we will be required to do those
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
um randomly selected on different
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
devices across the State starting um if
 
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
this bill um passes the full house
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
starting in the September State primary
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
which would read all of the ballots that
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
go through an electronic ballot counting
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
device thanks Erin so a question for
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is your intent to
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment to remove the
 
00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.230 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment to remove the
$100,000

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
$100,000
 
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
yes any representative
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
eil uh welcome back
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
um when you were here before I'm trying
 
00:58:27.789 --> 00:58:27.799 align:start position:0%
to remember I you had privacy concerns
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
with the bill and I'm assuming even as
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
proposed to be amended your privacy
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
concerns remain you were concerned about
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh accessible
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
voting thank you for the question I do
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
still have privacy concerns and I always
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
have I I am in favor of transparency in
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
elections I just have concerns if you do
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
not have the full set of data um people
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
are apt to make judgment calls on things
 
00:58:59.029 --> 00:58:59.039 align:start position:0%
that they don't have all of the
 
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
information on and that would lead to
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
more questions um and more
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
theories okay so you don't have the full
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
set of data and you have privacy
 
00:59:11.029 --> 00:59:11.039 align:start position:0%
concerns that continue all right I just
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
want to get it straight
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
here all right so as you heard
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire does have an
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that we do not have but we
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
should have for a next work session
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
which will be next
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
so now moving on to House Bill
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
1589 establishing a
 
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
veterans treatment
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
eron and we do have some additional
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
information from the LBA I think we have
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
like to state your name for the record
 
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
please and the gentleman I guess next
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
you might like to speak to is that my
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
I'd like to introduce him because I
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
think of myself as his hypewoman um I
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
just go around promoting how great our
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
new Statewide treatment Court
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
coordinator Alex Cassell is uh with the
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch he has been working in
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
the drug courts and he would be the
 
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
person who would oversee the veterans uh
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
courts and currently works in the
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
veterans track so he's here for any
 
01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
policy questions you have and then also
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Aon cre and I'm the
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the judicial
 
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
branch so I don't believe the division
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
had any particular problem with the bill
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
was just some Financial questions
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you Mr chairman
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
so this bill sends uh roughly $2 million
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
a year to the counties are the counties
 
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
the ones that are experiencing expenses
 
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:23.799 align:start position:0%
if the bill passes or is that the
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is that somebody else
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
we do have about uh 200,000 of expenses
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
but uh Alex can tell you a little bit
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
more about how the counties work in the
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
drug courts
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
sure so the the way that the finances
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
would work on the adult drug court end
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh that we um contract with either the
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
county or a treatment agency in that
 
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
particular County to run and operate the
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
adult drug court uh in that jurisdiction
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
so the cost to the court uh would be you
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
know the state coordinator um and any
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
kind of training database that kind of
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
stuff that that's for the court now for
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
the county itself uh the the they
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to put any um dollars into
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
it if if it's state funded in this the
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
same way that the adult drug courts are
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
um because the those funds fund uh
 
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
treatment case management coordination
 
01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
the burden that would be on the county
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
would be uh staff time uh a county
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
attorney or assistant County attorney
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
that would be on the team uh maybe uh
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
somebody that works at the jail would be
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
on the team uh for Staffing and for
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
court so the there would be no dollar
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
cost there would just be ink kind you
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
know people's time to to work on the on
 
01:02:34.599 --> 01:02:35.470 align:start position:0%
know people's time to to work on the on
the

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
program follow up thank you so um but
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
the theory first of all it's not drug
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
court it's veterans court right but so
 
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm assuming all right
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
um the supposedly these things save
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
money overall in the sense that some
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
being treated this way is not in jail
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
right right and that would be a count
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
the expense yes or no it would be a
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
county or state prison expense because
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
not everybody that is in the the
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
veterans court or the adult drug court
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
has a County uh you know sentence jail
 
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
sentence some of them have state prison
 
01:03:18.269 --> 01:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
sentences as well okay my last question
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
if I may um how many how many cases do
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
we expect this bill would would handle
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
per year you would create how many
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
veterans court cases will there be um
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
that we're not we're not 100% sure how
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
many there would be um I think that
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
there are other people here that might
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that better than I can
 
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.309 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that better than I can
thank

01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
you you need us Janet
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
problem seeing no further questions
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
much division like to move this
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney you happy with
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
this represent mag so the two things we
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
talked about about making changes
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
here one was and and the main one that's
 
01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:16.839 align:start position:0%
that's big time is um shall versus May
 
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
right um
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
because so that essentially can take the
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
money out of it right if we say to to um
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
counties that they may do such and such
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
than if they actually find it useful in
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
the sense that I just asked about you
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
know so that that it does save the money
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
because there' be fewer incarcerated
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
cases um then they can do it if and if
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
they so as I understand it this is
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
already being done in some counties but
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
not others and so if the experience in
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
those counties is positive they'll
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
they'll end up doing it but in addition
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
to that shall versus May um we were
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
thinking instead of just giving a
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
blanket $2 million a year for this for
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
this when we don't know how many cases
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
we don't know how much it's going to be
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
used why don't we say give um $5,000 a
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
case or some some particular number and
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
then that's a little incentive to do it
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
right we can say sha say may but here's
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
the little carrot that if you do these
 
01:05:29.549 --> 01:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
cases we'll give you some money for them
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
and and um if that later doesn't work
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
out then maybe the the May later on
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
could become sha Etc but but at least
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
would be a way to get started and and
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
those counties that find it useful can
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
get going Etc so that's that's what I
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
had in
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
mind yeah because I'm looking at the
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill now and on page four line 33 it
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
does say may
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
obtain estate Grant um
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
well I'm looking at line three of page
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
one I mean the bill is a little confused
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
between what the Jud Judiciary what the
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
counties do and stuff like that I would
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
remind you that the policy committee
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
voted 18 to zero on this
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
sure but but again the reason for
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
changing the shall on line 3 page one
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
is I think to take the money out
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
right so are you going to offer an
 
01:06:32.319 --> 01:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
right so are you going to offer an
amendment

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
or I I wanted to discuss it among us
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
first but I can
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
yes discussion represent wer I support
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
the concept and even um if if we say
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
shell then they're all going to go out
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
and panel a judge train him as necessary
 
01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
and and set up a court and put out the
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
word that they have it and then sit
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
there for a year with no no case could
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
very well happen with as few cases as
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard I think initially there were
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
40 cases a year is what we heard which
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
some of the small counties would likely
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
be zero but they would have to spend the
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
money because we told them to to set up
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
a court it's a waste so I think this is
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
a better way to go about it and and even
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
have it so that the county has to do
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
some steps first and spend some of their
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
money before they come and ask us for
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
more and if they don't have the need
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
they won't spend the money thank you
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin I'm I'm fully in full
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
support of uh represent of McGuire's
 
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment I think it definitely
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
should leave it up to the counties
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
whether they want to do it or not and uh
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the state paying a modest
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
for a veteran that uses the court seems
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
like a reasonable approach so I'm in
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
full support of his proposed
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
amendment any further
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
comments seeing n representative evil
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think that sounds like a
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
really reasonable proposal um the only
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
question I would have is how we decide
 
01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of money per case to give to
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
the county I representative mcgu
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned 5,000 I just didn't know how
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
calculated I guess every case is
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
different so it's hard to come down on a
 
01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.789 align:start position:0%
different so it's hard to come down on a
specific

01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
number represent brudi no no no all
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
right so you've got your marching orders
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I guess we're
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
looking encouraging you to find an
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendment on this thanks I'll talk to
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
Mike so Mike will schedule this for next
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
Wednesday as
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
well is there any expert here that can
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
give us an idea about how much it might
 
01:09:01.239 --> 01:09:08.269 align:start position:0%
give us an idea about how much it might
cost

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
case oh I saw him moving I thought it
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
was toward this Podium but actually it
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
room so for the record Warren Perry
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
Deputy agent General New Hampshire
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
veteran services I would just say
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
represent mire did I did some analysis
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that reasonably based Bas on
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
per capita numbers by County I think the
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
total number per year you know based on
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
whatever analysis I did would be about
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
27 and that that really accounts for
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
just VA eligible veterans so there would
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
could be some nonv eligible veterans
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
that would be eligible under this the
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
way the statute's written so that number
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
could be as many as 60 a year but if we
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
got to 60 I would be very surprised I
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
think that I think the demand for it in
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
the veteran Court you know at least
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
initially would be certainly under 60 a
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
year but I think closer to about 27 a
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
year would be about where we would be
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
and then you know the caveat is you know
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
this the veteran population New
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is declining by about 2.8% a
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
year so the numbers that you hear a lot
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
of times 100,000 veterans right now
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
we're sitting at about 990,000 veterans
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the state three years from now it'll
 
01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
be 86 so you know there'll be a unless
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
something changes there'll be a steady
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
decline in demand in the system just BAS
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
based on the number of veterans in the
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
state I hope that
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
helps may I uh ask my my co-presenter a
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
question is is there a difference in
 
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
cost if the person is not a VA veteran
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
that where VA is not going to shoulder
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
some of the costs yeah some some of the
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the costs associated
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
with the case management if they're if
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for VA Services is
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
shouldered by the VA counselors case
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
managers and some of those other things
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
nonv eligible veterans would be you know
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
that cost would be not shouldered by the
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
federal government so there would be
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
additional cost cost one another caveat
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
is the number of folks who are not VA
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
eligible based on some sort of
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
downgraded discharge from honorable is
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
relatively small so of those 990,000
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
veterans I would be really surprised if
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
there were 3,000 of them that had bad
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
paper right that had General discharge
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
or a bad conduct discharge it's really
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
rare but they might be the ones that
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit more trouble they
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
they could be the ones more apt to be
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
come in contact with the legal system
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
yes so yeah just as discussion so given
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
those kind of numbers that changes the
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
bill from a Millions per year to a
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousand per year kind of
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
thing which I think is good for getting
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
started so with with the 5,000 number
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
that we talked about
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
so all right thank you very much so
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
we'll look forward to representative
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
Wednesday so we have have next uh Senate
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 252 I'm going to move that down to
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
um house to uh be in concert with House
 
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.590 align:start position:0%
um house to uh be in concert with House
Bill

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
318 they're merging those together so it
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
talk about 252 by
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
itself and it will bring us up to um
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
speed on U our
 
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.750 align:start position:0%
speed on U our
time

01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
I believe we have a an amendment and
 
01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
maybe in a new fiscal note I have a uh
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
revised fiscal note and representative
 
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
Maguire may have an
 
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah did you make it or
 
01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:47.910 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah did you make it or
yes

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
so ask thank you so um so I'm opposed to
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
this bill in general for lots of reasons
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
and I can I can go into them um just to
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
just to give you an example I I brought
 
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
it some
 
01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.950 align:start position:0%
it some
stuff

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
um you know it this bill regulates
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
things like this right and so it it
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
assumes that that this might contain
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
pasas and and if the department thinks
 
01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
pasas and and if the department thinks
it

01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
does they will write a letter to the
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
president the whoever and somebody in
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
charge in the company saying does this
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
contain Pest and if so send us a letter
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh if not you have to you know if so
 
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to be banned but if not you
 
01:13:41.229 --> 01:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
got to send us a letter saying saying
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
you attest that this doesn't contain
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
Pest and by contain the bill says it's
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
it's not the soda it's not the metal
 
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
it's the like the ink on the can or
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a spray on the inside of
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
the can that keeps the soda from
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
contacting the metal it's in there and
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
the bill says any amount right I mean if
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
if it just contains one of the compounds
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
that's on the list um and and it applies
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
to not this can just this but every item
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
in the grocery store every piece of
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
cloth every everything and and I don't
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
think such a regulatory
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
scheme can really so first of all
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that they're not going
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
to go after this guy right I mean that
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
would be ridiculous to to to think that
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
they could ban this even if there is p
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
in this ink I don't know but but the
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
point is they can go after anybody any
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
little you know uh
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
eel eel e ebener sorry Abel Ebenezer
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
Brewery in marac that makes beer and
 
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
sells it in
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
cans they could go after them right and
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
what are they going to do they don't
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
make the cans they don't make the ink
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to go to their supplier
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
and say can you give me the letter that
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
says I there's no Pas here and the
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
supplier's going to say well I don't
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
know you know uh and and they the lawyer
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
of the supplier is going to tell them
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
look you can't sign such a letter
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
because of you know you're going to put
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
yourself in in Jeopardy here and so Abel
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
Ebenezer is going to go out of business
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
Bud wires is not going to go out of
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
business cloaks not going to go out of
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
business cuz we're not going to get them
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
but but the little guys we're giving
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
Dees the opportunity to essentially put
 
01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
every little guy out of business and let
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
me talk about something
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
else so this is a drug called
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
tastan okay it is not regulated by this
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill right so it's it's not drugs it's
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
only uh
 
01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
grocery items and cloth and and
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
furniture and a few other things but but
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
explicitly um not covered by the bill
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
and yet the
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
chemical that the bill says has to be
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
banned is in these
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
pills all right this is the number one
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
prescription drug in
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
America and it contains the chemical
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
that the bill
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
for bids okay so my Amendment and I I
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
let me hand this out by the way so
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
here's a you know a medical article that
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
explains all
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
that all right this is a I'll hand out a
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
few this way and a few this way all
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
right so um so this article goes into
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
the detail of nine different definitions
 
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
of Peep pass the one that we're using in
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
is the one if you go to uh let's go to
 
01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.030 align:start position:0%
is the one if you go to uh let's go to
page

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
um the chart on
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
page whatever page
 
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
eight so the chart on page
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
eight this is this is um the one says
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
greater than or equal to one fully
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
fluorinated carbon okay so that's the
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
second column of of different
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
definitions so so it's these X's you see
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
that all drugs in this list contain this
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
is the number one prescription drug in
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
the in the world I well in the United
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
States I don't know about the world
 
01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.430 align:start position:0%
States I don't know about the world
called

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
Lipitor um it
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
contains it's it's in this greater than
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
equal to one column as well as all the
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
other drugs there so it includes proac
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
it includes I don't know there's a whole
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
bunch of drugs here um the amend mment
 
01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.229 align:start position:0%
bunch of drugs here um the amend mment
which

01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
um is a different definition of pasas
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
and you know I got this from the the
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
span lobbyist okay so you know for
 
01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
whatever that's worth
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
um moves our definition to the last
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
column in this chart so it's the US EPA
 
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
opt there's no X's there right so there
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
so it would
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
take it would um take the things
 
01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:31.790 align:start position:0%
take it would um take the things
banned

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
banned
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
um no longer includes the the stuff
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's in here right and so you know I
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
would argue that the number one
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
prescription drug in America has been
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
tested and is found to be safe or at
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
least you know usable uh because it's
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
used by some very high fraction of
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
people in the country and I would also
 
01:18:54.239 --> 01:18:55.390 align:start position:0%
people in the country and I would also
argue

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
argue
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
that if you're swallowing the stuff
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
right it's going to
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
be very harmful to yourself compared to
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
if it's on the outside of your Coke can
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
or even on the inside of your Coke can
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
bound up in some thing or if it's in
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
your carpet or if it's in your T-shirt
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
or if you know all that kind of stuff
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
right if you're swallowing it that's got
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be the most harmful I would think but
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know not that I know but but anyway
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
so my Amendment moves us from the column
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
with all the
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
X's you know the stuff that's actually
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
in medication to the column that's not
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
in medication those will be the things
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
banned so I just want to again caution
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
my friend from Epsom that just came out
 
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
of the commer commission committee 16
 
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
to3 and we really have to try to focus
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
on the financial impact all right but is
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
it easier to regulate 15,000 compound
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
pounds or 1500 compounds that's the
 
01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.070 align:start position:0%
pounds or 1500 compounds that's the
issue

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
right so I mean all the
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
things if we if if by doing this we
 
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
exclude a large number of products that
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
need to be regulated then presumably it
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
costs less to regulate them but but the
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
costs are not just the cost to us right
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
I mean the the costs are the cost to
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
Society of seeing things that are useful
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
disappear from the
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
shelves that's all representative
 
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:35.719 align:start position:0%
wer I've been opposed to this since its
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
Inception I made calls when we were
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
working on the meramac uh New Hampshire
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
exposures and I called up Dees and I was
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
not satisfied with the answers I said we
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
can have 20 parts per million of arsenic
 
01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
which is a deadly poison and 20 parts
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
per million are a safe level you're at
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
12 parts per trillion which is
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
infinitesimal compared with Arsenic and
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
you want it removed from all our water
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
when it's in the air it's in our carets
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's in our drapes it's in our clothing
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
and we didn't not have not to date have
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
any human testing to see what the effect
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
is I could be carrying 30 parts per
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
million of past from all the times I've
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
been exposed to it and it has had no
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
effect on it so until we see some I'd
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
say this is premature until we see some
 
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
human testing going on in meramac and
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
get the results to what is the
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
Toleration level the people that were
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
most affected one woman that had the
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
child with birth defects she was there
 
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
stirring up stuff in a in a
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
lab and and absorbing it I don't think
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
she was wearing any protective gear she
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
was exposed to this stuff while it was
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
being mixed and okay it had a pretty
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
Toxic effect on her and her her Sun but
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
that was total
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
overexposure and and and some of the
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
other people that were working in there
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
and where where their their Wastewater
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
got got dumped affected other people but
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
until we see the real results of the 2
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
and a half million we've we paid for
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
phase three testing in meramac I don't
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
think we have any idea and I'd be I'd
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer to be tested as how much P do
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
I have in my blood it's LEL to be far
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
more than 12 parts per trillion 10 years
 
01:22:31.629 --> 01:22:31.639 align:start position:0%
ago you couldn't even measure that but
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
suddenly they can measure measure
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
minuscule amounts okay we're going to
 
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
have down to the minuscule amounts when
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
you don't even know the effects all of
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is is you know oh let's scare the
 
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
people and spend a lot of money and show
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
them the government's doing something
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
and it's bull thank
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
you so I've had some discussions with
 
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney from maram who
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
assures me this bill is absolutely
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
necessary and I'm certainly you know
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney has been closer to
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
it than probably any of us and I believe
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
she's even a co-sponsor of this
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and um knowing what she said
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
and you know what others have said but
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
anyway it's open for
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
discussion representative I'm sorry
 
01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.590 align:start position:0%
discussion representative I'm sorry
representative

01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
cells thank you Mr chair
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
um I agree kind of with both sides I
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
I think that more research is still
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
needed but uh in the from looking at it
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
from a financial standpoint I agree with
 
01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:35.719 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire that it will be
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
easier to um regulate 1500 versus 15,000
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
so in the spirit of moving forward
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
because I do believe we need to do
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
something to start to mitigate Paces
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
being used in our products I would uh
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
entertain um representative Maguire's
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment and and that I think would
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
again from a financial standpoint would
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
mitigate the cost but also allow us to
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
move in a positive direction so I would
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
I would uh
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
support with the amendment but I
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
probably would not support without the
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
amendment all right the motion has been
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
made is it
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
seconded it's seconded by representative
 
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
Griffin uh that's 1227 now have some
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you very much um
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for all the work and
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
thought that has gone into this um first
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
of all when we're changing the
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
definition this is a policy decision all
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
caps with glowing lights this issue of
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not to use this particular
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
definition was discussed in
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
Commerce and through a series Ser of
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
negotiations that involved span which is
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
the sustainable um Action pfast Network
 
01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:04.390 align:start position:0%
the sustainable um Action pfast Network
and

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
Honeywell rather than change the
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
definition there is an exclusion in the
 
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
bill and it is on page four lines 6 to
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
10 and this
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
exclusion basically similarly tracks the
 
01:25:24.159 --> 01:25:24.870 align:start position:0%
exclusion basically similarly tracks the
uh

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
definition that is being proposed by um
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire this was
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
discussed at length in the Commerce
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
Committee the lobbyists for many groups
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
were sitting there and when uh chair
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
hunt asked multiple times whether anyone
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
had any objection no one did this change
 
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
isn't going to really affect the cost of
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
implementation of the bill because the
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
exclusion basically tracks the
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
definition to some extent there are some
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
more uh compounds that would be included
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
with this Tusa definition that is being
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
proposed um and these additional
 
01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
compounds I have discussed at length
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
toxicologist and he had concerns about
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
using this um
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
this definition which is why uh Commerce
 
01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
decided to go with the exclusion and not
 
01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:34.950 align:start position:0%
decided to go with the exclusion and not
this

01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
definition secondly this definition is
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
very complex you can see that it's a
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
series of chemical
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
equations this is not the definition
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
that is used by any state that has a ban
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
in place for products that's 22 states
 
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
it is also not the definition that is
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
currently used in the state of New
 
01:27:01.109 --> 01:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with respect to firefighting
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
Pham so you're setting up a dichotomy
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
within our own statutes between
 
01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
statute span you must understand is a
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative of past
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers it is to their advantage
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
to have this definition because it's not
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
used any place else and if it's adopted
 
01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire it can be
 
01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
used to show that one state has gone
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
down this um track it's a complicating
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
change as much as I want this bill to
 
01:27:47.109 --> 01:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
pass it's just a change that rips the
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
gut out of this bill now as far as the
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
expenses I mean
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
I think that you know obviously chair
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
Wilder you don't dis you don't agree
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
with the with the testing to a trillion
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
scientists have put that into place
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
where another way of looking at this
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
even if you don't look at it from the
 
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
health side of it you look at the cost
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
that we're that are having to uh we're
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
having to spend I mean it's already over
 
01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.229 align:start position:0%
having to spend I mean it's already over
aund

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
aund
 
01:28:24.669 --> 01:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
million and these things these products
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
that are basically polluting our state
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
across the state from the soil
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint from the water standpoint
 
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
we're having to deal with them and it's
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
costing extreme amounts of money the
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
other thing I did email all of you
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
recently I don't have it in front of me
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
you have landfill operators you have
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants I know in
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
Salem they just spent $6 million to
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
upgrade their wastewater treatment
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
plants the sooner or later the EPA is
 
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to come out with a requirement
 
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
that surface waters are tested before
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
they are released for pasas the pasas
 
01:29:11.109 --> 01:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
that there it's probably going to be a
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
standard very similar to The Standard
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
that we currently have for drinking
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
water and it's going to C I can't even
 
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
guess I cannot even guess the amount of
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
money that that private um
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities are going to have to
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
spend on this and so this bill is a
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle to help our our
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities NH HMA also supports it
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
it'll help our landfill operators
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
because you heard they have a reverse
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
osmosis program at their landfill and
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
TurnKey that cost two or3 million and
 
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
they're spending
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
$50,000 a month to get the p and other
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
chemicals out of it TurnKey is the only
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
landfill that's treating its um leachate
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
before it sends it to a wastewater
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
treatment plant no other landfill is so
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
that means our our wastewater treatment
 
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
plants are having to deal with it and
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
honestly this is how I came to this
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
issue in the first place the solid waste
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the Wastewater people are very
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
nervous about future costs and then we
 
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
have the health care costs that we don't
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
so I have gone to so much
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
trouble to go through this bill to align
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
the things that are being banned with
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing so it makes
 
01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
sense we're joining in we're not leading
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
off and not one of these products is
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
something that anybody can claim that we
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
need p in you don't need Pas on a
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
child's uh mattress you don't need p on
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
your lip in your
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
lipstick um I've talked
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
to there were people concerned about PPE
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
there were people concerned about
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
pesticides I removed the fluorinated
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
containers that would have contained uh
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
pesticides because I thought from a
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
safety standpoint I should do that the
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
drugs and the and the medic medal
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
devices that have been excluded are
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
because there is a preemption in in
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
thing with the federal Food and Drug
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
Administration and I do not want to get
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the middle or bring the state into
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
the middle of uh disagreements with uh
 
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
our Medical
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
Care this bill has been
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
excruciatingly reviewed and the list of
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
people who support it and want it passed
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
are a mile long
 
01:31:54.719 --> 01:31:55.750 align:start position:0%
are a mile long
I

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
I and we're engaging here in a
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
discussion that is
 
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
100% um policy and we do have the new
 
01:32:07.109 --> 01:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
the new fiscal note I mean I don't even
 
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
think that we've um that we've discussed
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
it but I I appreciate representative
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
camell that you want to come to an
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
agreement over this definition but from
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
standpoint it's more complic ated for a
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to work within a ban with a
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
definition that doesn't go along with
 
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
anybody else's in this in the United
 
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
States than to use the definition that
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
everywhere represent Maguire thank you
 
01:32:45.109 --> 01:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
well as I don't think that last
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
statement is correct because where this
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
definition comes from is an EPA document
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
which I think has something to do with
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
reporting it does I mean you're you're
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
so the EPA asks you to report using this
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
particular definition right because it
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
has made an agreement to exclude hfos
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
and hfos are what are excluded in my
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
exclusion but if you're a
 
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that is um dealing or or
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
complying with bands that go from
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
California to to uh
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
Colorado I told I mean I gave the chart
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's multiple states that are doing
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
this they're not they're going to be
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
doing some reporting through the EPA but
 
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
the banss apply with the definition that
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
I have here and that's why it's here I
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
mean that's why we discussed it at
 
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
length at the Commerce Committee that's
 
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
why they voted out of the committee 16
 
01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
to3 we have been down this road and to
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
change up everything at this point is
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
basically disregard ing the com the
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
communications that we had in Commerce
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's like this is this couldn't be more
 
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
policy and honestly from a fiscal
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh it's not really going to
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
affect its
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
implementation it's putting our
 
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in a situation where they
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
have a different definition to deal with
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
with respect to the banss and Reporting
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
versus ban they're they're different um
 
01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
and you're really harming the bill by
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
passing this definitional change and I I
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
won't be able to support it I can talk
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
some more about it but you probably I
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
mean if you want to talk about the
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note we can representative s
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Griffin just
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
a question for you representative eel
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the work you put into
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
this you mentioned briefly a
 
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
conversation with the state
 
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
toxicologist about this definition can
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
you just go into further detail well I
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
mean this is the thing I probably spent
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
five hours with the man God bless him
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I went through every permutation
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
that you can think of of the chemistry I
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
talked to the fellow from span three or
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
four times I talked to the American
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
chemistry Council believe it or not they
 
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
have a model bill that is almost
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
identical to mine it has the same
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
products in it I mean you can ask jod
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
grimas we were on a conference call
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
three times with them I negotiated all
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
sorts of things with them so when I went
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
to the state talks echologist he had
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
concerns about using this definition um
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
in our bill because there were certain I
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
mean this gets into chemistry and where
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
you have double bonds and where you have
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
a carbon and where you have an oxygen
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
and he said that he thought that there
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
were toxology
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
concerns with this definition when it
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
came to bands and that's why I mean
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
believe me when I was sitting with span
 
01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
I was like okay if we use this
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
definition will everybody be happy and
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
he basically said yes but then I went to
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
the toxicologist he didn't like it I
 
01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:14.679 align:start position:0%
respect him he's a scientist and then I
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
talked to um all these other folks and I
 
01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
looked at the bands and the and the
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
definition that was being used the other
 
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
thing is this is anti IP atory it can
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
look to the Future um and I gu I just
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
have to explain that this whole thing
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
with the definition and the exclusion
 
01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:37.159 align:start position:0%
that I worked out it has to do with hfos
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
which are which are replacements for
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
hfc's which were the things in
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
refrigerants that were ozone
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
eaters and that's why you
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
know honey well in particular which
 
01:36:53.199 --> 01:36:54.070 align:start position:0%
know honey well in particular which
makes

01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
makes
 
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
refrigerants was particularly concerned
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill not apply to
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
hfos and I and even though there's not
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
one item in this bill that has hfos in
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
it I worked out a deal with them and I
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
put the exclusion in and that's why they
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
were fully on board with not changing
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
the definition the changes that I made
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
were reviewed by span and they approved
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
the um the exclusionary language and at
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
the end of the Commerce Committee
 
01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:31.159 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't know how many times four
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
or five chair hunt and all these people
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
were sitting there said do you have a
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
problem with this and no one said a word
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
I've been told by a board member who's
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
on the policy committee and the
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
executive committee of the Bia that the
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
Bia is neutral we had absolutely nobody
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
here opposing it so if we make this ch
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
change we're making a change just
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
because there's some misgivings about
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
its applicability and it's not based on
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
all the support that's been developed
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
over the last four to six months all the
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
research that's gone into this it's like
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
we're just throwing it away and I it's
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
just really really uh Troublesome to me
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
I I so I really wish that you would
 
01:38:23.709 --> 01:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
understand that the exclusion for the
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
most part takes care of what's happening
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
with this definitional change um I
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
removed the notification Provisions
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
because they were a problem for
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and I didn't see them
 
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the country I took the
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
labeling Parts out they were a problem
 
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
for manufacturers I saw them nowhere
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
else in the country this bill has been
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
refined and cut back and refined and cut
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
back and that's why when we get to
 
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
finance we don't deal with policy in all
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
caps because the policy has been worked
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
on so much before we even got here and I
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
would not bring a bill to you that I
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
didn't think worked for New Hampshire
 
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
and was leading us down the Primrose
 
01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
path I'm really concerned about the um
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
about the health of our people and about
 
01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
the cost that we have ahead of us so
 
01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I that's a very long answer to
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
your question but yes the toxicologist
 
01:39:25.149 --> 01:39:25.159 align:start position:0%
had conc concerns with this
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
definition representative Griffin I have
 
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
a very simple question uh the definition
 
01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:36.679 align:start position:0%
here every item in that definition is
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
covered by your definition is it not
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
every item that's in this definition is
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
covered by my definition in other words
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
this is a subcategory of your definition
 
01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a subcategory of it that
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
in so we're doing good with sticking
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
with the definition that we have again
 
01:40:19.629 --> 01:40:19.639 align:start position:0%
it's the one that's used across the
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
United States for these sorts of bands
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
and it's the one that's in the
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam um statute so if we
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
change it we're actually in some ways
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
maybe messing around with what we
 
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
already have in
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
law and it's a I mean you can see it
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated um chem set of
 
01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:42.679 align:start position:0%
chemical equations that's why nobody
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
uses it it's very difficult to apply so
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
if we want to do something really good
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
for the state and and like we did with
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
Mercury because there's a Clearing House
 
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
for mercury we did for toxics and
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
packaging because there's a clearing
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
house for that we would apply this in
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
the same way this is just another um
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
chemical and if this bill is
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
changed the supporters I can tell you
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
will be extremely disappointed because
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
they they stayed so long and have worked
 
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
bill seeing no further questions we do
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
have an amendment on the floor that was
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%

01:43:59.070 --> 01:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
could I respond just briefly to
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
represent uh chair Wilder's comment I
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
thought you asked the question um when
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
Nancy Murphy was here the last time
 
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
whether they now have human studies that
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
have shown cancer and she said they did
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
but I know that we have another kidney
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
cancer cluster um thing but I just think
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
that and then Nancy just wrote us some
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
followup information about um human
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
testing but you know I I guess I would
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
also say this is about more than cancer
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's about endocrine um Interruption and
 
01:44:34.589 --> 01:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
all many other health effects and not
 
01:44:34.599 --> 01:44:42.310 align:start position:0%
all many other health effects and not
just

01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
cancer okay and I'll second it oh you'll
 
01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.149 align:start position:0%
cancer okay and I'll second it oh you'll
second

01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
it okay there's been a an amendment
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
offered 1086
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
6h it's been moved by representative
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
Griffin I'm sorry grassy seconded by

representative Griffin when the clerk is
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
ready please call the role
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay could I just speak very briefly to
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment all all I was going to all
 
01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
to be said is that if you with the
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
removal of the uh notification and all
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
the other provisos the reason that the
 
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
that the uh bill was originally
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
effective in 2020 was all this
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
preliminary stuff that's been removed
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
and um and I've spoken to the agency I I
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
have to say I I heard from um Mr whims
 
01:45:37.149 --> 01:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
that his father just had a very bad fall
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
and he's not able to be here otherwise
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
he could corroborate this he said that
 
01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
from an agency standpoint um moving up
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
the date didn't really affect anything
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
one way or the other so okay
 
01:45:53.679 --> 01:45:56.830 align:start position:0%
one way or the other so okay

way this was
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
written the money
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
lapses uh within a certain bium and if
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
the ban takes place outside the time
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
period of the
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
bium um the money would be
 
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
gone and he wondered if we should say
 
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
non-aps I'm sorry with so much going on
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
I haven't actually looked at this he
 
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
said in so I guess it would be in um
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
of section three page six he just wanted
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure if the money was
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated that it could continue to
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
be used by the department as it as the
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
out I think it was I'm not sure if
 
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with that uh if if you
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a he thought
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
one well or I just want to make sure
 
01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:14.679 align:start position:0%

all right this this will be taken up by
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
week so we do have next as we was noted
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
we move Senate Bill 252 to be taken up
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
with the house bill
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
318 um there is an amendment to
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
consolidate Senate Bill 252 Senate Bill
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
249 and House Bill 318
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
that Mr Hoffman will pass out um there's
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
a lot to all this and being that it's 10
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
minutes at 12 and we have we'll schedule
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
this for a full discussion for next
 
01:50:07.229 --> 01:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or Tuesday whatever it works
 
01:50:10.589 --> 01:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
in but uh if you
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
recall there were a lot of uh issues
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
between lining fiscal notes up and some
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
overlap with some of the
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
bills so what working with
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman and
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
Melissa we put everything together into
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
one bill there no language change of any
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
of the bills but it's all one bill with
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
a updated fiscal note I have U reached
 
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
out to the ranking member of the
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee and the chair
 
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
I've not heard back from Terry Roy the
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
chair the reason for you know I want to
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
hear from Terry as well the judicial
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
branch has looked over this and I have
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
heard from eron that they saw no no
 
01:50:59.550 --> 01:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
problems but again there's a lot to it
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman is also put together a
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
comparison uh comparing each bill and
 
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
where the language went into the new
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 318 which he'll hand out for
 
01:51:19.229 --> 01:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
weekend so once uh thata all that
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
um does this include the training U
 
01:51:42.189 --> 01:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
issues that we deferred to this
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
committee yesterday it does not so
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
that's got to be added in it will
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
probably be added in because there is
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
some overlap there um as you'll see in
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
this new combined Amendment the bill
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner fee is now $60 that
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment we saw yesterday was 50 but um
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be talking to
 
01:52:04.069 --> 01:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire to see how we can
 
01:52:08.109 --> 01:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
try to roll 10:05 into this as well 105
 
01:52:10.350 --> 01:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
has been scheduled for next week as well
 
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you it actually still
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
say Mr chair Mr Hoffman if I can explain
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
this a little bit
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
sure this takes the
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
three this takes the three uh bail
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
reform bills 249 252 and House Bill 318
 
01:52:31.629 --> 01:52:31.639 align:start position:0%
and combines them into one that's all it
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
does is string them
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
together uh the the large sheet that I
 
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
handed out is in the same ORD of the
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
three bills and it kind of shows you in
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
the right hand column where there may be
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
overlap or things to considering other
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
bills and then at the bottom put a
 
01:52:51.709 --> 01:52:51.719 align:start position:0%
little box in there that says decisions
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
to be made so hopefully at the end of
 
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
the process you go through this and
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
you'll have a document that hits all the
 
01:53:00.990 --> 01:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
issues but doesn't duplicate or conflict
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
with within the
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
bills you know and we do have an
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
amendment I know you prepared one for
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
the $60 it's separate I have separate
 
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
amendments that members have asked for
 
01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:16.599 align:start position:0%
for 252 and 318 and as those are
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
together I I did note and representative
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
Maguire noted as well that some of the
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
numbers are still different I know the
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
judicial branch gave us some new numbers
 
01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
as far as the costs which were lower
 
01:53:35.069 --> 01:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
than what the original bills had for
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes that's correct would you
 
01:53:39.790 --> 01:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
like the other amendments handed out
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.440 --> 01:54:21.350 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure we hear from uh
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy as well and I see the
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
ranking member is here and she's been oh
 
01:54:37.239 --> 01:54:51.310 align:start position:0%
ranking member is here and she's been oh
she's

01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:57.629 align:start position:0%
 
gone

01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
Amud no
 
01:55:08.069 --> 01:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
agree as a chair probably recalls the
 
01:55:14.189 --> 01:55:14.199 align:start position:0%
Senate move the fee up to $60 that would
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:29.310 align:start position:0%
 
support

01:55:29.310 --> 01:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
so for after lunch I guess we got a
 
01:55:35.229 --> 01:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
number of cannabis amendments coming
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
forward representative Maguire you have
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
one right um no I well yes I have an
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
amendment I I just asked for Senator
 
01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
ab's uh amendment to be formally graphic
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
um but I have other thoughts about can
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
us that you know we really need a big
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
picture look at it rather
 
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
than you know getting into the weeds typ
 
01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:04.470 align:start position:0%
than you know getting into the weeds typ
of

01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
weed although representative McGuire
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
goes below the weeds
 
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
right yeah I was just in yeah I was just
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
in Maine and and there's like one
 
01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
there's a store every street corner I
 
01:56:25.229 --> 01:56:25.239 align:start position:0%
mean it's just
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
incredible what it's like over there but
 
01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.870 align:start position:0%
incredible what it's like over there but
but

01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
um you know the so there the there's a
 
01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
lot of things we we let's talk about it
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
at 1:00 I
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
guess no
 
01:56:41.199 --> 01:56:43.550 align:start position:0%
guess no
yeah

01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
yeah no I I've actually never used it so
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.239 --> 01:56:56.990 align:start position:0%
 
worth

01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
so obviously we don't have to take up
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
any of these amendments but if you want
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
to put them together with
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
the document that you have with the
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
comparisons we can take them all up next
 
01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
week yeah there was another bill that
 
01:57:13.229 --> 01:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
we're no longer in custody of that had
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
magistrates correct that's one of the
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
Senate bills it's one put it in here
 
01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
yeah it's in there there we the f note
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
was really confusing So In fairness to
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
the chair when he looked at it there was
 
01:57:31.149 --> 01:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
no yeah there was no impact but there
 
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
really was buried in the bill but it was
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
way back to the Senate but there was a
 
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
large amount of money but it wasn't
 
01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
listed it was kind of tucked in the bill
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
helpful and if if I think what we can do
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
sorry I think what we can do in this
 
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
case is if we make sure that the
 
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
effective date of this bill is like a
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
day after whatever the effective date of
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
that bill was
 
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
then then this would replace it right
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
about Janet is uh putting them down as
 
01:58:01.239 --> 01:58:02.270 align:start position:0%
about Janet is uh putting them down as
we

01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
speak so it looks like
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Tuesday or Wednesday she said it
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
was depending on when you planned uh
 
01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:19.910 align:start position:0%
was depending on when you planned uh
full

01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.069 --> 01:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
Finance yeah was either going to be when
 
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't want to have you miss
 
01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chair one more thing we we
 
01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%

yesterday and that'll kind of it's not
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the uh the walkth through but it'll
 
01:58:58.350 --> 01:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
parts you just want to add that in for
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
next week as far as fitting it into the
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
comparison for this yeah yeah I can do
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%

so we'll open the work session on um
 
03:08:03.790 --> 03:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
house bills
 
03:08:06.910 --> 03:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
1633 relative to the legalization and
 
03:08:09.349 --> 03:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
regulation of cannabis and making an
 
03:08:09.359 --> 03:08:10.910 align:start position:0%
regulation of cannabis and making an
appropriation

03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
03:08:13.510 --> 03:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
therefore like to call a prime sponsor I
 
03:08:15.389 --> 03:08:15.399 align:start position:0%
believe you have maybe an updated
 
03:08:17.630 --> 03:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment right and some other
 
03:08:20.269 --> 03:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
information for
 
03:08:23.309 --> 03:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
us regrets to the committee from
 
03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative grassy he broke off of
 
03:08:28.429 --> 03:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
his yeah and I'm not sure where he's
 
03:08:31.790 --> 03:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:35.710 --> 03:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
yeah um thank you I last week I came in
 
03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
with a marked up which was the
 
03:08:40.229 --> 03:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
information that I had presented to OS
 
03:08:42.190 --> 03:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
um I have now have the official
 
03:08:44.190 --> 03:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment because it took so long to do
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
that pivoting to a replace all was time
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
prohibit of because I wasn't even sure
 
03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
if they'd get it to me in time for this
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
hearing um so because of that I had also
 
03:08:55.830 --> 03:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
provided the original Bill where I went
 
03:08:58.349 --> 03:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
through in the PDF and I marked out
 
03:09:02.590 --> 03:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
anything that is amended is grade out
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
and anything that is struck is struck
 
03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:07.479 align:start position:0%
out just so that it's easier to compare
 
03:09:10.110 --> 03:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
and I apologize that just because of
 
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
time constraints changing to a replace
 
03:09:15.429 --> 03:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
all just wasn't really a feasible ask so
 
03:09:18.349 --> 03:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
my apologies there
 
03:09:21.750 --> 03:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
so getting sorry no not at all now is
 
03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note has that been updated
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
for this do you know Mr
 
03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hoffman um so as far as a fiscal note
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
there was an addition for the Department
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services um with Mr
 
03:09:37.070 --> 03:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hol and that is included in here um any
 
03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
additional updates that that are part of
 
03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
this process in order to better
 
03:09:42.750 --> 03:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what the Liquor
 
03:09:45.070 --> 03:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
Commission needs in order to start this
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
up um I'd be happy to figure out how to
 
03:09:49.950 --> 03:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
do that and sorry I'm sort of putting my
 
03:09:51.870 --> 03:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
parachute on on my way out of the plane
 
03:09:53.309 --> 03:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to make sure
 
03:09:55.830 --> 03:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
that we have the right
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations but I'm just going to
 
03:09:58.590 --> 03:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
grab on to one of you guys because you
 
03:09:59.830 --> 03:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
have a parachute and it'll be able to
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:07.229 --> 03:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
us no it's very helpful have the clean
 
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
and the markup that that's very helpful
 
03:10:12.190 --> 03:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um and so just zooming
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
back out now it's been said that this
 
03:10:16.510 --> 03:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
model is just a rebranding and a
 
03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
redressing of the the free market model
 
03:10:19.950 --> 03:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
and that it's the same thing as other
 
03:10:23.349 --> 03:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
states but that's not actually true in
 
03:10:24.870 --> 03:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
other states there's a cannabis
 
03:10:27.870 --> 03:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
commission but that is not so deeply
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
embedded in the government as our Liquor
 
03:10:31.630 --> 03:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
Commission is most of those are at arms
 
03:10:33.349 --> 03:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
length and most of those are reporting
 
03:10:34.670 --> 03:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
through a whole bunch of different lay
 
03:10:36.309 --> 03:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
layers in order to protect the state
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
from involvement they don't have the
 
03:10:40.990 --> 03:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
same kind of control that our Liquor
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
Commission does in liquor and this truly
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
is an agency model where we're looking
 
03:10:49.150 --> 03:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
at that control through agency as
 
03:10:51.550 --> 03:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to control through state run
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
stores or this new idea of franchise
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
stores so this this is not what's going
 
03:10:58.429 --> 03:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
on in other states I also want to let
 
03:11:00.349 --> 03:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
you know that in other states there are
 
03:11:04.349 --> 03:11:04.359 align:start position:0%
not um franchise Outlets any franchises
 
03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
or for different things like different
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
brands like cookie it's one of the
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
brands that's sold all around the
 
03:11:11.670 --> 03:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
country but because you can't sell
 
03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
Interstate they license the the products
 
03:11:16.630 --> 03:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
they license the seed and then people
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
within the different states do them so
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
generally when you hear the term
 
03:11:21.750 --> 03:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis franchise that's talking about
 
03:11:23.710 --> 03:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
the product level and not the regulatory
 
03:11:26.830 --> 03:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
scheme so um getting back to this
 
03:11:29.309 --> 03:11:29.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and to this bill it has been
 
03:11:31.870 --> 03:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
narrowed to be just a hard 15 stores
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
just as was seen in the other competing
 
03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment um because the idea is we need
 
03:11:38.910 --> 03:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
to start out small this requires the
 
03:11:40.990 --> 03:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to come up with the
 
03:11:44.150 --> 03:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
rules around the um lack of lobbying and
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
political contributions that are part of
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
that that recipe that's necessary for
 
03:11:51.389 --> 03:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
our cake to actually make it out of the
 
03:11:56.110 --> 03:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
oven um and this bill really has a lot
 
03:11:59.590 --> 03:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
of solid positive control over the
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
market the state controls advertising
 
03:12:05.070 --> 03:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
and marketing in this by having very
 
03:12:08.469 --> 03:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
very tight rules on what is allowed in
 
03:12:10.590 --> 03:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
products and product categories that was
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
already existing in the bill um where
 
03:12:15.150 --> 03:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
you can't have something that looks like
 
03:12:18.150 --> 03:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
it has cartoon characters or something
 
03:12:20.710 --> 03:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
that depicts misuse of cannabis you
 
03:12:22.429 --> 03:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
can't have the bloodshot eyes behind the
 
03:12:25.150 --> 03:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
wheel um that's not acceptable and
 
03:12:27.349 --> 03:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
definitely not acceptable in our classy
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis model um and by not advertising
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're not bringing new people into using
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis I recognize that there's an
 
03:12:38.830 --> 03:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
interest in spending the tax dollars
 
03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
that come from Cannabis uh my husband's
 
03:12:43.870 --> 03:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
Mentor um C ever coup the former s
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
Surgeon General said there's nothing so
 
03:12:48.990 --> 03:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
addictive as is spending tax dollars
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
from cigarettes and that's something
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
where we want to make sure that we are
 
03:12:56.309 --> 03:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
balancing those two different needs the
 
03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that people who are
 
03:13:00.190 --> 03:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
already using cannabis aren't buying
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
contaminated products or simply uh
 
03:13:04.429 --> 03:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
putting money into coffers of other
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
states versus growing the market here
 
03:13:09.510 --> 03:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
and having the state involved in
 
03:13:11.830 --> 03:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of cannabis
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
users so over time it does seem that
 
03:13:17.550 --> 03:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
there is a trend um to more people as
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's some understanding there are
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
some people who are becoming lowd does
 
03:13:24.110 --> 03:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
users people who use Edibles or
 
03:13:25.950 --> 03:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
tinctures or something else where they
 
03:13:27.550 --> 03:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
know sort of what they're getting if
 
03:13:29.590 --> 03:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
they want to have some sort of
 
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
controllable um some controllable High
 
03:13:34.750 --> 03:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
you know somebody like having a beer as
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to somebody going for some ever
 
03:13:39.670 --> 03:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
CLE um you know you you have the the
 
03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
different ways that people can
 
03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
experience things and by moving it off
 
03:13:45.150 --> 03:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
of the streets into a regulated market
 
03:13:47.550 --> 03:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
those people who do want to have
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
essentially half a beer in the Cannabis
 
03:13:51.830 --> 03:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be able to do
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
that um as far as appr Appropriations um
 
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
this bill has uh money for the positions
 
03:14:01.229 --> 03:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
that are needed at the Department of
 
03:14:03.630 --> 03:14:03.640 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services for the
 
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping um there's a lot of data
 
03:14:07.710 --> 03:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
information that was initially given to
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of Information Services
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
that is not part of what they do that
 
03:14:15.030 --> 03:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
actually is appropriately housed in the
 
03:14:16.750 --> 03:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
and with Mr Holt from the Department we
 
03:14:20.830 --> 03:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
were able to amend that language it's
 
03:14:22.830 --> 03:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
already in there this amendment now has
 
03:14:25.349 --> 03:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
the funding that's necessary for
 
03:14:29.349 --> 03:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
it so um I guess I'm I'm not not sure
 
03:14:31.229 --> 03:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
exactly which questions you have about
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
this I think that this is a really
 
03:14:35.469 --> 03:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
really solid model that allows positive
 
03:14:38.190 --> 03:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
State control over a market to make sure
 
03:14:40.510 --> 03:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't grow too quickly but
 
03:14:41.870 --> 03:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
also make sure that it has the
 
03:14:45.630 --> 03:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility necessary so that we can
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
have um The Innovation
 
03:14:50.309 --> 03:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
within a controlled framework so that
 
03:14:51.469 --> 03:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
people will want to come to New
 
03:14:53.710 --> 03:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um either stay in New
 
03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and purchase the Cannabis
 
03:14:56.950 --> 03:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're already buying out of state here
 
03:14:58.469 --> 03:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
or for tourists when they're coming
 
03:15:00.510 --> 03:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
through that perhaps along with some
 
03:15:03.030 --> 03:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
maple syrup they might also pick up um
 
03:15:08.950 --> 03:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:12.469 --> 03:15:12.479 align:start position:0%

the uh um the dispersement of that
 
03:17:55.349 --> 03:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
fund it requires reporting um for how
 
03:17:57.189 --> 03:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
that fund is uh being

03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
has specific language that creates a new
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
position for that responsibility and an
 
03:18:12.189 --> 03:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:16.510 --> 03:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
position yeah thank you so um are you
 
03:18:18.630 --> 03:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
not doing already this kind of reporting
 
03:18:22.229 --> 03:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
stuff for the for the medical
 
03:18:25.750 --> 03:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
program uh we we are doing an annual
 
03:18:28.870 --> 03:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
data report for the medical program yes
 
03:18:31.189 --> 03:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
but this is unrelated uh this is an
 
03:18:31.199 --> 03:18:32.830 align:start position:0%
but this is unrelated uh this is an
unrelated

03:18:32.830 --> 03:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
unrelated
 
03:18:36.550 --> 03:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
function okay all right the types of uh
 
03:18:39.189 --> 03:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
the types of uh uh of data that would be
 
03:18:41.389 --> 03:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
required to be reported by this are
 
03:18:45.550 --> 03:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
Baseline data with regard to um DUI
 
03:18:48.429 --> 03:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
convictions um um the original Bill had
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh graduation rates um things like uh
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
unintentional childhood poisonings um
 
03:18:56.710 --> 03:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
and these are not these are not things
 
03:18:59.550 --> 03:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
that the medical program is uh is is
 
03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
tracking um in our annual data report
 
03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
what we do is number of patients you
 
03:19:06.590 --> 03:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
know number of providers uh some really
 
03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
basic data uhu but not impacts of Health
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes at large to the general
 
03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
population of New Hampshire okay all
 
03:19:15.630 --> 03:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
right let's go on to the substance abuse
 
03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
thing that you mentioned
 
03:19:20.790 --> 03:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
um does this creates a brand new fund
 
03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
Etc we already have a drug and alcohol
 
03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
treatment fund right um is there some
 
03:19:30.110 --> 03:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
reason why we couldn't just put more
 
03:19:32.870 --> 03:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
money into it or as opposed to creating
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
a whole new thing um I'm not the drafter
 
03:19:37.590 --> 03:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
of this section um my understand and and
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my uh colleague from the
 
03:19:42.710 --> 03:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
Bureau of drug and alcohol Services is
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
not able to be here today however my
 
03:19:48.469 --> 03:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the desire uh or
 
03:19:51.309 --> 03:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
the intent of a separate fund is to
 
03:19:56.229 --> 03:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that this funding remains for its
 
03:20:00.349 --> 03:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
intended purpose um we have historical
 
03:20:03.429 --> 03:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
examples of the uh the money dedicated
 
03:20:06.750 --> 03:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
from the liquor money going to this fund
 
03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
being reappropriated and reallocated in
 
03:20:10.910 --> 03:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
different directions so the idea behind
 
03:20:14.429 --> 03:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
this is to um my understanding is to
 
03:20:16.750 --> 03:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
keep it separate to keep it safe for its
 
03:20:19.229 --> 03:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated purpose um you'll note however
 
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill does require
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
this fund Administration to be in
 
03:20:27.590 --> 03:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
concert with the governor's Commission
 
03:20:30.269 --> 03:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
on Alcohol and Other Drugs um principles
 
03:20:31.510 --> 03:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
priorities um so it is a separate fund
 
03:20:37.030 --> 03:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
could it be joined with the existing
 
03:20:40.990 --> 03:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
fund probably um but the desire here as
 
03:20:43.150 --> 03:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
the the initial drafters were to keep it
 
03:20:44.950 --> 03:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
separate to keep it
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
safe um and to add add one other point
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
to that in the other fund that's
 
03:20:51.429 --> 03:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
pre-existing that one is moving to a
 
03:20:53.590 --> 03:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
large focus on harm reduction harm
 
03:20:55.630 --> 03:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
reduction is mitigating all the
 
03:20:57.950 --> 03:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
non-legal consequences of using an
 
03:21:01.630 --> 03:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
illegal product um taking cannabis which
 
03:21:03.870 --> 03:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
now would be no longer prohibited in the
 
03:21:06.590 --> 03:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
state and using that to address the
 
03:21:09.469 --> 03:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
consequences of illegal drug use as
 
03:21:11.150 --> 03:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to dealing with the with any
 
03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
potential consequences around somebody
 
03:21:15.469 --> 03:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
who's experiencing cannabis misuse would
 
03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
be moving it from a addressing anything
 
03:21:20.309 --> 03:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
related to passage of this bill and
 
03:21:23.229 --> 03:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
moving it into a different area and
 
03:21:24.309 --> 03:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
because if you're dealing with those
 
03:21:25.750 --> 03:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
other issues and the harm reduction
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
we've talked about things like
 
03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
potentially addressing housing as a harm
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
reduction issue uh I recognize that
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors that go into it
 
03:21:36.030 --> 03:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
but this is trying to keep it more
 
03:21:38.229 --> 03:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
focused on the proximate C proximate
 
03:21:42.630 --> 03:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
issues of cannabis but but existing I
 
03:21:45.309 --> 03:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
mean drug and alcohol right one is legal
 
03:21:48.990 --> 03:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
one isn't right so already that fund
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
deals with some people who are having
 
03:21:52.590 --> 03:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
problems with a legal product and some
 
03:21:54.269 --> 03:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
people having problems with an illegal
 
03:21:56.429 --> 03:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
product that's a true statement I missed
 
03:22:01.309 --> 03:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
that part okay all right so um all right
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
now my current understanding is that
 
03:22:09.309 --> 03:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
number one to some extent uh cannabis is
 
03:22:12.429 --> 03:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
a substitute for for alcohol right that
 
03:22:13.950 --> 03:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some people that are
 
03:22:17.309 --> 03:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
currently alcohol users who will will
 
03:22:20.510 --> 03:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
who will use less and use more cannabis
 
03:22:22.870 --> 03:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
does that sound right I know quite a few
 
03:22:24.910 --> 03:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
people in other states that no longer
 
03:22:30.550 --> 03:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
drink okay um do we have any concept of
 
03:22:33.229 --> 03:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
what fraction that will be or something
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
like that um I think that's a hard thing
 
03:22:36.910 --> 03:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
to put a number on people talk about the
 
03:22:38.670 --> 03:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis increasing on
 
03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
legalization but I really think a lot of
 
03:22:42.990 --> 03:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
that is a reporting issue that once it's
 
03:22:44.670 --> 03:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
no longer prohibited more people are
 
03:22:46.870 --> 03:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
willing to say that they use a product
 
03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
so there's people who would just lie or
 
03:22:50.750 --> 03:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
not mention the fact that they used
 
03:22:53.349 --> 03:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis previously so it's hard to have
 
03:22:55.750 --> 03:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
good self-reported data on something
 
03:22:58.110 --> 03:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
that had been illegal well I may ask the
 
03:23:00.630 --> 03:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission about how have sales
 
03:23:04.189 --> 03:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
to outof State residents changed since
 
03:23:07.229 --> 03:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
they have legalized marijuana all right
 
03:23:10.830 --> 03:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
the second question is my current
 
03:23:15.110 --> 03:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that cannabis is
 
03:23:17.309 --> 03:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
less harmful than
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol that that fewer PE I I read an
 
03:23:24.309 --> 03:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
article which compared The Addictive
 
03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
qualities of
 
03:23:31.550 --> 03:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
nicotine uh cannabis cocaine and alcohol
 
03:23:35.269 --> 03:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay and it said nicotine
 
03:23:35.279 --> 03:23:37.030 align:start position:0%
okay and it said nicotine
67%

03:23:37.030 --> 03:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
67%
 
03:23:41.550 --> 03:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
addictive um alcohol 23% addictive
 
03:23:45.910 --> 03:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
cocaine 20% addictive and cannabis 9%
 
03:23:45.920 --> 03:23:47.429 align:start position:0%
cocaine 20% addictive and cannabis 9%
addictive

03:23:47.429 --> 03:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
addictive
 
03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay so less than half compared to
 
03:23:49.840 --> 03:23:51.269 align:start position:0%
okay so less than half compared to
alcohol

03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
03:23:55.150 --> 03:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
so so to the extent that people use
 
03:23:57.269 --> 03:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis instead of alcohol aren't the
 
03:23:59.790 --> 03:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
problems less and therefore we need less
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
of this kind of uh treatment and those
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
kind of things um so I think that also
 
03:24:07.550 --> 03:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
leaves out the fact that physical
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
dependency is an physical addiction um
 
03:24:13.150 --> 03:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
chemical addiction is not something that
 
03:24:15.670 --> 03:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
happens with cannabis so with alcohol
 
03:24:16.990 --> 03:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why we kept the
 
03:24:18.670 --> 03:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
liquor stores open when everything else
 
03:24:20.590 --> 03:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
was locked down is that people can die
 
03:24:23.070 --> 03:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
if they suddenly can no longer consume
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol I have a friend who had a major
 
03:24:26.790 --> 03:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
heart attack he was smoking two packs a
 
03:24:29.189 --> 03:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
day he can't go cold turkey because that
 
03:24:30.990 --> 03:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
could kill him because of the physical
 
03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
addiction issues so um yes I think that
 
03:24:35.269 --> 03:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
the harms could be a lot less but I
 
03:24:37.229 --> 03:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
think that there's a lot of concerns out
 
03:24:40.950 --> 03:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
there and a lot of lack of understanding
 
03:24:42.229 --> 03:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
just because this is something that's
 
03:24:43.830 --> 03:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
been sort of hidden in the shadows for
 
03:24:46.510 --> 03:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
so long that I think that starting off
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
with a fund that would deal with any of
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
these problems is a good way to address
 
03:24:52.830 --> 03:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
it because if you have if you have more
 
03:24:56.670 --> 03:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
people who you know I think that maybe
 
03:24:58.710 --> 03:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
priming the pump and potentially putting
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit more into this to start
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense if we find that we're
 
03:25:05.550 --> 03:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
finding lower harms now that cannabis
 
03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
once cannabis is legal then we can move
 
03:25:10.030 --> 03:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
that out and we can do something with it
 
03:25:12.269 --> 03:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
and that's probably what we will see but
 
03:25:13.870 --> 03:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
let's wait until we see what the facts
 
03:25:16.429 --> 03:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
bear out before we move this away and
 
03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
see if we can see what it actually cost
 
03:25:20.429 --> 03:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
to treat anything related to cannabis
 
03:25:22.269 --> 03:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
because if we find that these funds
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much go unuse because they were
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
not seeing actual problems from Cannabis
 
03:25:29.550 --> 03:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
misuse that would be subject to these
 
03:25:31.469 --> 03:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
funds then that would go a long way even
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
beyond the data that would be collected
 
03:25:35.349 --> 03:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
if we literally have no place to spend
 
03:25:37.950 --> 03:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
the money to address these substance use
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
disorder um in cannabis then that shows
 
03:25:42.870 --> 03:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
us that it was a lot safer than some
 
03:25:44.830 --> 03:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
people had been concerned with so I'd
 
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
have if we keep it like this and then
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
change it in the future because it's
 
03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
less harmful I'd say that's a win for
 
03:25:53.710 --> 03:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
everybody if I if I may I might just
 
03:25:55.510 --> 03:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
offer the uh one of the purposes for
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
this fund um and and one of the uh is
 
03:26:01.950 --> 03:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
for public education campaigns both
 
03:26:04.750 --> 03:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
preliminary before uh retail sales
 
03:26:07.630 --> 03:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
happen and um during uh the the roll out
 
03:26:09.950 --> 03:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
and afterwards so the uh the public this
 
03:26:11.830 --> 03:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
is a homark of other success successful
 
03:26:13.950 --> 03:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
programs where these public education
 
03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
campaigns need to be well funded um for
 
03:26:19.150 --> 03:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
the start of uh retail sales um and
 
03:26:22.469 --> 03:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
continue thereafter thank you yeah um
 
03:26:24.750 --> 03:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
all right I I don't have any other HHS
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
related questions but I do have more on
 
03:26:29.229 --> 03:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
this page so if anybody else I'll be
 
03:26:30.870 --> 03:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
right out there if you need me well
 
03:26:34.710 --> 03:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else thanks for coming I
 
03:26:35.950 --> 03:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
if you could sit
 
03:26:39.990 --> 03:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
down H sit down uh thanks for coming
 
03:26:42.229 --> 03:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
could you explain in the in this new
 
03:26:44.990 --> 03:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment how atc's are handled for
 
03:26:48.830 --> 03:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:51.630 --> 03:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
I mean she but and if you want to
 
03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
comment on the ATC program and its
 
03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
success and its treatment under these
 
03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
bills the Department's General position
 
03:27:02.910 --> 03:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
would be any any model of adult use
 
03:27:04.910 --> 03:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
legalization needs to take into
 
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
consideration um the therapeutic
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis program which has been
 
03:27:09.790 --> 03:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
operational with the law in place for 10
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
years and and fully operational for the
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
past seven uh we have 14,000 patients um
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
being served by the ther utic cannabis
 
03:27:22.150 --> 03:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
program and it is a valuable
 
03:27:25.710 --> 03:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
program and a and a path of either
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
transition or integration with an adult
 
03:27:32.510 --> 03:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:35.349 --> 03:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
important my belief or my understanding
 
03:27:37.710 --> 03:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
of both the bill that has come out of
 
03:27:39.309 --> 03:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
Commerce and the
 
03:27:43.269 --> 03:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
amendment creates if not a perfectly
 
03:27:45.710 --> 03:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
clear path for transition and
 
03:27:45.720 --> 03:27:46.790 align:start position:0%
clear path for transition and
integration

03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
integration
 
03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
it does create a path for integration
 
03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
and transition some of those Hallmarks
 
03:27:52.439 --> 03:27:55.670 align:start position:0%
and transition some of those Hallmarks
um

03:27:55.670 --> 03:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
include uh include a requirement for the
 
03:28:01.150 --> 03:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:28:05.189 --> 03:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
to work collaboratively with the Liquor
 
03:28:05.199 --> 03:28:06.710 align:start position:0%
to work collaboratively with the Liquor
Commission

03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
03:28:10.429 --> 03:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
o by December 1st 2024 to come up with a
 
03:28:13.750 --> 03:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislative plan for next session on how
 
03:28:16.670 --> 03:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
to integrate these two programs the
 
03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
language states that uh the the plan
 
03:28:21.870 --> 03:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
must be uh must consider transitioning
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program in
 
03:28:26.830 --> 03:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
whole or in part and so we would be
 
03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
working you know when this if this bill
 
03:28:30.150 --> 03:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
passes we' be working with the Liquor
 
03:28:33.070 --> 03:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
Commission closely um to figure out does
 
03:28:35.110 --> 03:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
for instance HHS keep the patient
 
03:28:38.429 --> 03:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
registry and continue uh issuing cards
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
um do we send over or propos to send
 
03:28:43.750 --> 03:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
over the regulation of the atcs the
 
03:28:45.790 --> 03:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
licensing aspect of the the cultivators
 
03:28:48.030 --> 03:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
and the retailers uh to The Liquor
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
Commission or do we move the whole thing
 
03:28:51.229 --> 03:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
over to the Liquor Commission Now
 
03:28:52.630 --> 03:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
obviously you know that the Liquor
 
03:28:55.630 --> 03:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
Commission may not be um uh Adept yet at
 
03:28:58.110 --> 03:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
a public health related program of of
 
03:29:00.030 --> 03:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
patient you know Registries but there
 
03:29:01.590 --> 03:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
may be a value in maintaining the
 
03:29:03.630 --> 03:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
Integrity the program at a whole as a
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
whole so that that is the Hallmark in my
 
03:29:09.950 --> 03:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
mind of what uh representative this bill
 
03:29:12.030 --> 03:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
and the Amendments support and that is
 
03:29:14.710 --> 03:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
an acknowledgement that a transition
 
03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
plan and an integration plan
 
03:29:20.710 --> 03:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
must be considered as we move
 
03:29:23.550 --> 03:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
forward there are other detailed
 
03:29:28.070 --> 03:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions in here about um uh requiring
 
03:29:29.910 --> 03:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission
 
03:29:32.150 --> 03:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
to have
 
03:29:35.070 --> 03:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
a I mean you might be able to speak uh I
 
03:29:38.510 --> 03:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
can hop in now WR um and so within this
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
um we had in Commerce one of the last
 
03:29:42.630 --> 03:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
changes is we had removed the Dual use
 
03:29:44.670 --> 03:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
lure because that was something that had
 
03:29:46.590 --> 03:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of different objections
 
03:29:49.229 --> 03:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
I I didn't see all of the conflict about
 
03:29:51.349 --> 03:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
the idea of having two masters because
 
03:29:53.030 --> 03:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
you can have somebody who has two
 
03:29:54.910 --> 03:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
different regulations um because if
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
you're selling food and you're selling
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
alcohol you're dealing with the
 
03:29:58.750 --> 03:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and you're
 
03:30:00.990 --> 03:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the Liquor Commission um
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
however it did seem more straightforward
 
03:30:04.990 --> 03:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
to get rid of that dual use lure um we
 
03:30:07.229 --> 03:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
had included that one of the major
 
03:30:09.150 --> 03:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
criterias in assessing the relative
 
03:30:11.030 --> 03:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
merits of applications would be a
 
03:30:14.269 --> 03:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
successful operation as a ATC so that
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
that would recognize what the atcs have
 
03:30:18.429 --> 03:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
already done and consider that in the
 
03:30:21.150 --> 03:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
process that is in the bill it's um it's
 
03:30:22.830 --> 03:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's in the section that was amended um
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
even though those were there page eight
 
03:30:27.510 --> 03:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the amendment lines 9 through 12 what
 
03:30:29.550 --> 03:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
I did not catch when I removed the Dual
 
03:30:31.229 --> 03:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
use and which is probably the most
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
important thing about this amendment is
 
03:30:36.910 --> 03:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
that I had not had anything about making
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
sure that they were issued a cultivation
 
03:30:41.150 --> 03:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
license um and they were still able to
 
03:30:43.110 --> 03:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
cultivate the therapeutic cannabis and
 
03:30:44.550 --> 03:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to cultivate
 
03:30:46.910 --> 03:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
both adult use and therapeutic cannabis
 
03:30:49.309 --> 03:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
at the same facility that they would not
 
03:30:52.189 --> 03:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
have to move their facility that they've
 
03:30:53.710 --> 03:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
already established and have already had
 
03:30:56.309 --> 03:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
approved through Municipal regulations
 
03:30:58.429 --> 03:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
um to a different location just because
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
now that we're adult entering the adult
 
03:31:02.070 --> 03:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
use people may have changed their
 
03:31:03.670 --> 03:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
perceptions about what should happen
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
where um from what I know about all the
 
03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
locations where it's cultivated for
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use those have all been
 
03:31:11.870 --> 03:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
placed in places where they're sort of
 
03:31:13.309 --> 03:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
out of the way and not really a problem
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
for people in the communities and um
 
03:31:17.790 --> 03:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
sort of having to reopen that and deal
 
03:31:19.349 --> 03:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
with that especially if a town doesn't
 
03:31:21.070 --> 03:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
want to have adult use but they're fine
 
03:31:23.189 --> 03:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
continuing with the therapeutic let's
 
03:31:25.269 --> 03:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
let's not mess with what we have and so
 
03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's one of the significant parts of
 
03:31:28.349 --> 03:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment so you'd find at the
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
bottom of page eight lines 35 through 37
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's on the cultivation on page 10 the
 
03:31:36.309 --> 03:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
restrictions of locations and
 
03:31:40.150 --> 03:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
grandfathering is lines 17 through 20 um
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
and I have a feeling there's another one
 
03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
that I didn't see just flipping through
 
03:31:45.630 --> 03:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
I apologize I had had that road map that
 
03:31:47.590 --> 03:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
I laid out with that highlighted yellow
 
03:31:49.150 --> 03:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
one last week but I didn't bring that
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
with me sorry I should have brought a
 
03:31:50.640 --> 03:31:53.990 align:start position:0%
with me sorry I should have brought a
file

03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:56.670 --> 03:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
cabinet may I would also offer that um I
 
03:31:58.830 --> 03:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
believe the this committee has received
 
03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
um handouts from um one of the atc's
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
Granite Leaf cannabis um that has a
 
03:32:06.189 --> 03:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
crosswalk between the highlights of the
 
03:32:09.550 --> 03:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
the 1633 um and this amendment alongside
 
03:32:12.189 --> 03:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
um the Senator's uh Amendment as well um
 
03:32:14.830 --> 03:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
showing the differences in in in and how
 
03:32:19.189 --> 03:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
1633 does create um a a a path towards
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
integration and and considers the the
 
03:32:23.550 --> 03:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
the fate of the um therapeutic cannabis
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
program um and I'm I'm sure Mr Simon
 
03:32:29.349 --> 03:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
will be happy to detail those uh as as
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
as well um we know we know that when
 
03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
states legalize for adult use the
 
03:32:39.990 --> 03:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
patient registration roles in a medical
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
program drop dramatically we have 14,000
 
03:32:47.189 --> 03:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
patients in the program a a 30 to 50%
 
03:32:51.189 --> 03:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
drop Is Not Unusual um and the the the
 
03:32:53.710 --> 03:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
basic problem is that if half the
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
patients no longer are serving uh or no
 
03:32:59.229 --> 03:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
longer being served by the atcs it
 
03:33:01.389 --> 03:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
becomes a question of how long will they
 
03:33:04.990 --> 03:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
be able to remain viable serving a
 
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
severely diminished population patient
 
03:33:10.590 --> 03:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
population base if they're not uh if
 
03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're not granted a path into the uh
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
the adult use space and I think this
 
03:33:15.840 --> 03:33:17.309 align:start position:0%
the adult use space and I think this
Bill

03:33:17.309 --> 03:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
creates that path to a to a certain
 
03:33:21.429 --> 03:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
degree it's as it's as good as we're
 
03:33:23.710 --> 03:33:23.720 align:start position:0%
going to get at this
 
03:33:26.830 --> 03:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
point and and with that it's more that I
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
could get a prescription for a 600
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
milligram Ibuprofen but I can also go to
 
03:33:32.590 --> 03:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
the count to go to the drugstore and
 
03:33:34.349 --> 03:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
have my over-the counter 200 milligram
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
pills too that's there's some where
 
03:33:38.429 --> 03:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
there's a reasonable substitution where
 
03:33:40.189 --> 03:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
somebody would have that access so is
 
03:33:41.670 --> 03:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
that is that a good understanding of why
 
03:33:46.429 --> 03:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
people drop off um yeah that is a good
 
03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:53.670 --> 03:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh the vast majority of people who use
 
03:33:55.830 --> 03:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis are in some part using cannabis
 
03:33:58.710 --> 03:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
to self-medicate a a self a medical
 
03:34:02.349 --> 03:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
condition um and if you don't have to go
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
to the state and pay them $50 and go to
 
03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
your doctor to talk about you know your
 
03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
self-medication people will choose the
 
03:34:11.229 --> 03:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
easy path um and choose the the
 
03:34:13.110 --> 03:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
recreational store not register for the
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
program however there's a segments of
 
03:34:18.189 --> 03:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
the population the therapeutic cannabis
 
03:34:20.830 --> 03:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
population which which need a medical
 
03:34:24.070 --> 03:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
program in order to participate um
 
03:34:26.469 --> 03:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
people who would never think especially
 
03:34:28.110 --> 03:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
an older population they would never
 
03:34:31.630 --> 03:34:31.640 align:start position:0%
think to go into a recreational retail
 
03:34:34.990 --> 03:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
store where the goal is to purchase the
 
03:34:38.910 --> 03:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
highest potency THC product possible um
 
03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
because that's all they see uh without
 
03:34:43.710 --> 03:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
getting without without having talk to
 
03:34:46.189 --> 03:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
their doctor first without going to a
 
03:34:49.189 --> 03:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
place that has education and staff that
 
03:34:52.429 --> 03:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
is aligned with a therapeutic use and so
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
those are the patients they don't make
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
up the majority of the 14,000 but they
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
are critical people to be able to
 
03:35:01.309 --> 03:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
continue to serve um within the
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
program further
 
03:35:06.750 --> 03:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um is the
 
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
14,000 the ones with current
 
03:35:12.510 --> 03:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
prescriptions or is it the total number
 
03:35:14.309 --> 03:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
of the over the history of the program
 
03:35:16.349 --> 03:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
that have had a prescription no it's the
 
03:35:19.070 --> 03:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
current number um and and it's important
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're not prescriptions technically I
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
know it's you know it's it's words but
 
03:35:23.830 --> 03:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know they matter there's
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
certifications providers certify that a
 
03:35:28.110 --> 03:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
patient has a qualifying condition which
 
03:35:29.830 --> 03:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
allows them to be on the program to
 
03:35:31.830 --> 03:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
purchase cannabis providers in New
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are not prescribing cannabis
 
03:35:37.229 --> 03:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
they can't prescribe cannabis due to its
 
03:35:37.239 --> 03:35:38.349 align:start position:0%
they can't prescribe cannabis due to its
Federal

03:35:38.349 --> 03:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition does the certification
 
03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
expire at some point um yes currently
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
the certifications are good for up to
 
03:35:48.950 --> 03:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
three years at a time the default is one
 
03:35:52.229 --> 03:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
year um the legislature passed uh um
 
03:35:54.750 --> 03:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
passed a law allowing certifying
 
03:35:56.550 --> 03:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
providers based on their clinical
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
discretion to certify for up to three
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
years at a time and then they have to
 
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
renew so if if someone took it for six
 
03:36:07.550 --> 03:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
months and their medical problem got
 
03:36:09.750 --> 03:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
cured you wouldn't necessarily know
 
03:36:11.229 --> 03:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
about it they would still be on your
 
03:36:15.070 --> 03:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
list as one of the one of the active
 
03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
ones I
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
in in theory but I would that the vast
 
03:36:20.189 --> 03:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
majority of the qualifying conditions
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
that are authorized by the legislature
 
03:36:25.510 --> 03:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
are chronic in nature um and and
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis is not Curative it is a way to
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
alleviate symptoms so no one is no one
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
is being cured of their Ms through the
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis they are Ma they're
 
03:36:36.910 --> 03:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
they're managing their symptoms through
 
03:36:38.910 --> 03:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
through its use uh we do have Provisions
 
03:36:41.670 --> 03:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
in our rules that says that you know um
 
03:36:44.670 --> 03:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
a provider is required to void or not
 
03:36:47.229 --> 03:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
renew a person card if they no longer
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
suffer from that particular condition um
 
03:36:52.349 --> 03:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
and that happens or somebody tries it
 
03:36:54.389 --> 03:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
for their Condition it's not effective
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
and then they stop using it absolutely
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
and we have a process where people um uh
 
03:37:02.590 --> 03:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
can and do um self void their cards they
 
03:37:04.630 --> 03:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
submit a a request to to void their
 
03:37:07.630 --> 03:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
cards happens regularly thank you and
 
03:37:09.550 --> 03:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was just recently
 
03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
p is we had um we changed the rules
 
03:37:14.309 --> 03:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
around chronic and severe pain so when I
 
03:37:15.990 --> 03:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
was a medical device analyst one of the
 
03:37:17.229 --> 03:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
big things when you're getting a hip
 
03:37:18.790 --> 03:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
replacement or a knee replacement is
 
03:37:21.469 --> 03:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
being able to move quickly so opioids
 
03:37:23.110 --> 03:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
have always been a part of that
 
03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
previously our law required you to try
 
03:37:27.870 --> 03:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
opioids but there is the potential for
 
03:37:30.189 --> 03:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
somebody if all they need is enough so
 
03:37:31.910 --> 03:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
that they're not grimacing and pain when
 
03:37:34.309 --> 03:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
they're walking on that new joint that
 
03:37:35.790 --> 03:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
if that is something where the doctor
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
thinks it's appropriate to certify that
 
03:37:39.030 --> 03:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be a short-term use but that's
 
03:37:40.189 --> 03:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
because it's something where otherwise
 
03:37:42.070 --> 03:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
there would be short-term opioids but
 
03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much the only unique
 
03:37:45.870 --> 03:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
short-term use that we have that I know
 
03:37:47.630 --> 03:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
that's right and our forms allow a
 
03:37:50.070 --> 03:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
three-month certification or a six-month
 
03:37:50.080 --> 03:37:52.150 align:start position:0%
three-month certification or a six-month
trial

03:37:52.150 --> 03:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
trial
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
say are any more questions for
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
Mike I do have a quick one it's kind of
 
03:38:02.710 --> 03:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
going off the reservation a little bit
 
03:38:05.590 --> 03:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
when you went into medical marijuana H
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
there were uh how many stores initially
 
03:38:10.229 --> 03:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
and were a few more added as years went
 
03:38:10.239 --> 03:38:11.710 align:start position:0%
and were a few more added as years went
on

03:38:11.710 --> 03:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:38:15.790 --> 03:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
or yes when the law first passed in 2013
 
03:38:18.150 --> 03:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
it allowed uh and still allows for a
 
03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
maximum of four ATC alternative
 
03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
treatment center licenses each one of
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
those licenses required The Entity to be
 
03:38:28.030 --> 03:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
not for profit and also vertically
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
integrated vertically integrated means
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
that they were each entity was required
 
03:38:35.229 --> 03:38:35.239 align:start position:0%
to cultivate manufacture and dispense
 
03:38:35.239 --> 03:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
to cultivate manufacture and dispense
therapeutic

03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
03:38:39.309 --> 03:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis they were only allowed under
 
03:38:42.389 --> 03:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
the original uh legislation to have one
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
retail location for dispensing so for
 
03:38:47.950 --> 03:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
years there were four stores in the
 
03:38:52.630 --> 03:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
entire State um in 2018 and 2019 I
 
03:38:54.830 --> 03:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
believe legislation passed to allow each
 
03:38:57.990 --> 03:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
one of the lenses to open a second
 
03:39:01.229 --> 03:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
dispensary location within their region
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and to date three out of the four
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
lenses uh have have opened um a second
 
03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
location so we have seven locations
 
03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
right now but that is capped there's you
 
03:39:12.670 --> 03:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
know we would need a law change to allow
 
03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
them to open you know additional
 
03:39:17.070 --> 03:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
locations um I would say that you know
 
03:39:19.229 --> 03:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
we we do uh needs and assessments and
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of you know travel
 
03:39:22.590 --> 03:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
time and whatnot and the North country
 
03:39:24.510 --> 03:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
is significantly you know has a
 
03:39:26.590 --> 03:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
significant travel burden with regard to
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh to to accessing the most northern
 
03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
location at Conway now a number of
 
03:39:38.070 --> 03:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
states have gone from the medical to
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
retail sales of facilities is was that
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
ever explored with you folks doing that
 
03:39:48.510 --> 03:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:50.550 --> 03:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
that option has been explored by the
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
legislature for years you know um and
 
03:39:56.550 --> 03:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a standard approach with
 
03:39:59.429 --> 03:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
regard to other states allowing dual use
 
03:40:02.429 --> 03:40:02.439 align:start position:0%
licenses um allow or and and even you
 
03:40:02.439 --> 03:40:03.349 align:start position:0%
licenses um allow or and and even you
know

03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:40:06.990 --> 03:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
grandfathering uh medical entities into
 
03:40:09.269 --> 03:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
the adult youth space um the Vermont
 
03:40:11.790 --> 03:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
model is instructive if you know the
 
03:40:13.309 --> 03:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
it's a very similar program where
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
there's very few U Medical dispensaries
 
03:40:18.429 --> 03:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
and those dispensaries when they passed
 
03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
an adult use law um as long as they met
 
03:40:23.309 --> 03:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
the requirements had a license in good
 
03:40:26.269 --> 03:40:26.279 align:start position:0%
standing as a medical facility they were
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
granted um uh the ability to serve adult
 
03:40:33.910 --> 03:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
use patients so you know the department
 
03:40:36.269 --> 03:40:36.279 align:start position:0%
is not you know Department's neutral on
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
legalization um we are interested in a
 
03:40:41.070 --> 03:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
path forward that maintains the
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
viability of these atcs and maintains
 
03:40:48.030 --> 03:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
their ability to continue to serve the
 
03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
patients of New
 
03:40:52.590 --> 03:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thanks Mike as always your
 
03:40:54.389 --> 03:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
testimony is very
 
03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you I I have a couple
 
03:40:59.950 --> 03:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
questions but anybody else in the
 
03:41:02.429 --> 03:41:02.439 align:start position:0%
division and just to address that last
 
03:41:04.429 --> 03:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
point the our legislation initially had
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
allowed all of the atcs to convert and
 
03:41:09.429 --> 03:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
be able to sell adult use as well um but
 
03:41:12.750 --> 03:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
under the 15 store cap um that's why
 
03:41:15.870 --> 03:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
it's more giving them an an extra little
 
03:41:18.309 --> 03:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
Factor within the consideration because
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
when you have 15 stores there were a lot
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
of people that were concerned that it
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be fair to automatically give
 
03:41:26.269 --> 03:41:26.279 align:start position:0%
them a license um I think that they've
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
been in the market for quite some time
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
and I think that they've uh they've been
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
able to provide that access so I
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be opposed to that but it's not
 
03:41:35.670 --> 03:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
all about exactly what one person wants
 
03:41:36.870 --> 03:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's about the one that gets to the
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:41.710 --> 03:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
necessary all right well I do have a
 
03:41:43.590 --> 03:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
couple of financial questions I see as
 
03:41:46.269 --> 03:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
far as the Appropriations on your new
 
03:41:50.189 --> 03:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
page 15 thank you going on to 16 we've
 
03:41:52.149 --> 03:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
got the
 
03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh $8 million for uh the fiscal year
 
03:41:59.550 --> 03:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
ending in 25 so there's been no change
 
03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
there that would come out of as you're
 
03:42:03.750 --> 03:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
proposing General
 
03:42:07.950 --> 03:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
funds and then down on line 18 whereas
 
03:42:10.189 --> 03:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
before we didn't know where that money
 
03:42:12.630 --> 03:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
was coming from that was now looks like
 
03:42:15.309 --> 03:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
it's coming out of General funds so I
 
03:42:17.389 --> 03:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
guess my question is we've heard a lot
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
of different numbers flying around from
 
03:42:23.950 --> 03:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
other proposals is the8 and a half or
 
03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
8.6 million I guess because there's some
 
03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
money there for the Department of Health
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is that sufficient
 
03:42:32.269 --> 03:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking back at the commissioner
 
03:42:32.279 --> 03:42:33.110 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking back at the commissioner
of

03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:42:37.110 --> 03:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
it I think I saw a figure of about 500
 
03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
mill I'm sorry five million dollars
 
03:42:42.189 --> 03:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
there just to take care of the upgrades
 
03:42:44.269 --> 03:42:44.279 align:start position:0%
necessary at The Liquor Commission as
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
you probably know this been some
 
03:42:48.670 --> 03:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
longstanding problems with this nextg
 
03:42:51.030 --> 03:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
system over there inventory issues
 
03:42:54.309 --> 03:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
control so is that enough to take care
 
03:42:56.510 --> 03:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
of bringing the Liquor Commission online
 
03:43:00.550 --> 03:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
to do this through upgrades and it so I
 
03:43:01.790 --> 03:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner if you'd like to come
 
03:43:04.149 --> 03:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
forward and maybe address that because I
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
do see that there is a figure here that
 
03:43:08.910 --> 03:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you provided that number
 
03:43:11.710 --> 03:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal node or where that came
 
03:43:14.590 --> 03:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
from well uh good afternoon Mr chair
 
03:43:16.590 --> 03:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh Dennis goule
 
03:43:18.510 --> 03:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
the uh commissioner of the Department of
 
03:43:21.910 --> 03:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
Information Technology um I maintain a
 
03:43:23.750 --> 03:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
close relationship with the chairman and
 
03:43:26.070 --> 03:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
his leadership team so we we speak about
 
03:43:29.389 --> 03:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
it issues uh on a regular basis um and
 
03:43:31.389 --> 03:43:31.399 align:start position:0%
particularly on the ne nextg project
 
03:43:35.590 --> 03:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
which you referred to um so um the
 
03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
intent here would be to um uh Implement
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
a separate set of systems for this
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
business so that we're not comingling
 
03:43:47.710 --> 03:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
the lior and cannabis data so that would
 
03:43:51.030 --> 03:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
involve licensing as well as the um you
 
03:43:54.510 --> 03:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
know managing the product life cycle of
 
03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the product so that so that liquor is
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
able to fulfill their regulatory role um
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
so you know the good news is the bad
 
03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
news is it's something new we haven't
 
03:44:06.870 --> 03:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
done before so I'm sure there'll be
 
03:44:10.269 --> 03:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
challenges there the good news is that
 
03:44:12.670 --> 03:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
implementing you know Green Field new
 
03:44:14.189 --> 03:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
systems without having to replace
 
03:44:16.030 --> 03:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
something else is orders of magnitude
 
03:44:20.229 --> 03:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
more simple uh to do than changing out a
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
a complex system that's already running
 
03:44:26.590 --> 03:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
in a complex business so I I'm confident
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
that you know we we collaborated on
 
03:44:29.950 --> 03:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
those numbers and I'm confident that
 
03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
we're you know we're not exact but we're
 
03:44:35.590 --> 03:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
within an order of
 
03:44:38.189 --> 03:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
magnitude now what do you anticipate as
 
03:44:40.349 --> 03:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
far as getting the system up and running
 
03:44:43.590 --> 03:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
and being able to fully function like
 
03:44:46.870 --> 03:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
two years one year what's your best shot
 
03:44:49.990 --> 03:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
as far as an estimate um I'm not sure I
 
03:44:53.189 --> 03:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
could answer that I think that um as we
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
get into the process of if should this
 
03:44:58.110 --> 03:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
pass and should we get moving on getting
 
03:44:59.910 --> 03:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
the business up and running then we'll
 
03:45:01.349 --> 03:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
be doing the procurements and the
 
03:45:03.550 --> 03:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
procurements will help educate us on
 
03:45:07.469 --> 03:45:07.479 align:start position:0%
what the time frame I would I'm just a
 
03:45:09.510 --> 03:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know educated guest I'd say between
 
03:45:13.950 --> 03:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:13.960 --> 03:45:16.670 align:start position:0%
 
range

03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
range
 
03:45:18.830 --> 03:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have any further questions of
 
03:45:21.550 --> 03:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
the commission or anybody else uh
 
03:45:23.710 --> 03:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
representative eil you thank you for
 
03:45:27.229 --> 03:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
coming um so just could you talk a
 
03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
little bit about as far as it costs
 
03:45:33.349 --> 03:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that to the extent our
 
03:45:36.229 --> 03:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
systems is similar to others it'll be
 
03:45:39.070 --> 03:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
less expensive to develop our it and if
 
03:45:41.830 --> 03:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's completely different it's more and
 
03:45:43.550 --> 03:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
how does that affect the
 
03:45:49.750 --> 03:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
cost well it is true that systems where
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
we where um
 
03:45:57.950 --> 03:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
requirements uh compliance with um
 
03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
complex requirements inside um federal
 
03:46:05.229 --> 03:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
or state statute um can drive complexity
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
which also drives cost and then changing
 
03:46:09.670 --> 03:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
it frequently also drives cost right so
 
03:46:11.710 --> 03:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
if we end up having a you know we
 
03:46:13.389 --> 03:46:13.399 align:start position:0%
Implement something and four years later
 
03:46:15.149 --> 03:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
we you know we create a whole set a
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
different set of requirements or
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
increasing requirements and that drives
 
03:46:22.429 --> 03:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
complexity which drives um both upfront
 
03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
cost in terms of implementing it into
 
03:46:26.590 --> 03:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
the systems as well as maintaining it on
 
03:46:27.830 --> 03:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
an ongoing
 
03:46:30.389 --> 03:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
basis um there are vendors out there who
 
03:46:33.389 --> 03:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
are are in this business already
 
03:46:37.710 --> 03:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
um you know if I'm thinking that if our
 
03:46:39.990 --> 03:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
model ends up being close to one of
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
those we may be able to go right out of
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
the box with one of those
 
03:46:46.110 --> 03:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
systems um if not but you know I'm not
 
03:46:49.229 --> 03:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
saying that to influence what what is
 
03:46:51.070 --> 03:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
passed but rather just you know a
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
statement of what I think will
 
03:46:56.590 --> 03:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
happen further questions of the
 
03:46:58.510 --> 03:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner sing now I really
 
03:47:00.750 --> 03:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your being here sir all right
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks and so I guess I'll ask
 
03:47:07.149 --> 03:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
him after if that means the same sort of
 
03:47:09.630 --> 03:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
uh traceability issues and that sort of
 
03:47:11.070 --> 03:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
thing so that we can figure out what
 
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
what to align best but I'll I'll catch
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
you afterwards on that and I'll tell you
 
03:47:21.830 --> 03:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
guys so I see in the new version uh I
 
03:47:23.910 --> 03:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
didn't happen to find the breakdown of
 
03:47:25.389 --> 03:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
where the funds were going in the
 
03:47:29.070 --> 03:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
original version you had like 65% going
 
03:47:31.710 --> 03:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
here and then another 5% going there I
 
03:47:33.149 --> 03:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
didn't see that in the new draft have
 
03:47:36.510 --> 03:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
you taken that out on page 33 no that's
 
03:47:38.550 --> 03:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
still within there in the dra okay
 
03:47:40.269 --> 03:47:40.279 align:start position:0%
because I would looking at you're marked
 
03:47:43.030 --> 03:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
up page 33 but I'm looking at the
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
corrected one so I see it's still there
 
03:47:48.550 --> 03:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
but this is this is an amendment to the
 
03:47:48.560 --> 03:47:49.630 align:start position:0%
but this is this is an amendment to the
original

03:47:49.630 --> 03:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:47:52.110 --> 03:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
Bill well this is the one we got today
 
03:47:55.630 --> 03:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
that was the mark so we have um so I had
 
03:47:57.510 --> 03:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
had that yellow one previously but this
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
one that I had emailed you last night
 
03:48:01.630 --> 03:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
that has the grade out areas it just
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
Grays out the areas that have been
 
03:48:04.990 --> 03:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
amended so that anything that's not is
 
03:48:08.189 --> 03:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
is remaining okay I'm cuz I saw the
 
03:48:10.590 --> 03:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
second one here the 15 page document I
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
thought you would scale this 37 page
 
03:48:16.630 --> 03:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
document down to 15 so I apologize for
 
03:48:19.030 --> 03:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
that that would be nice hopeful you know
 
03:48:20.790 --> 03:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
I was hopeful I I would love that lower
 
03:48:22.229 --> 03:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
regulatory touch but that's not
 
03:48:23.670 --> 03:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
something that the state is ready for at
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
this point and um quite honestly it
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
probably may not be because it is a
 
03:48:28.040 --> 03:48:30.830 align:start position:0%
probably may not be because it is a
complex

03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
topic now the representative uh from Dar
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
knows I've asked the ncsl to do a deep
 
03:48:40.830 --> 03:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
dive in this whole situation and I we'll
 
03:48:42.630 --> 03:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
have that information for our next
 
03:48:44.910 --> 03:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
meeting so I'm already learning some
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
interesting facts that I didn't know but
 
03:48:51.309 --> 03:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
uh so we are going to meet on this
 
03:48:55.389 --> 03:48:55.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me this bill next week um there
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
is an amendment coming forward that we
 
03:48:58.750 --> 03:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
will see today that representative
 
03:49:01.950 --> 03:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
Maguire is going to offer and the uh
 
03:49:03.910 --> 03:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
clerk's office is rule that is kind of
 
03:49:06.870 --> 03:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
non- gerine based on what we've been
 
03:49:09.189 --> 03:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
given so we will have a hearing next
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
Wednesday in full Finance at 11
 
03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
p.m. did I say PM you I I'm serious
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
about PM you know because we're GNA be
 
03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
here all day before that but no 11
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
am um are there any more questions for
 
03:49:30.429 --> 03:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I wanted to go back to page 33 if I
 
03:49:33.510 --> 03:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
could sure yeah all right so the we'll
 
03:49:36.670 --> 03:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
skip over the 65% and go to 10% for the
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
Community reinvestment Fund why why is
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
that in um yes that is created within
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
this so that we can make make sure that
 
03:49:47.229 --> 03:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
there is some money going back to our
 
03:49:50.149 --> 03:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
communities for sewers um for other
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
things so that we can support the
 
03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
communities that um that really need
 
03:49:55.950 --> 03:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
some help so Water and Sewer expansion
 
03:49:59.070 --> 03:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
Pro uh projects legal aid for expansion
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
of cannabis convictions grants to assist
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
Farmers entering the Cannabis market and
 
03:50:05.389 --> 03:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis related research and
 
03:50:07.990 --> 03:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
development um these are all areas that
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
as there's more understanding and and
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
more um that is happening within the
 
03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
market that's good to have the reseearch
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
and and devel velopment but honestly I
 
03:50:18.389 --> 03:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
think one of the biggest Parts is that
 
03:50:20.790 --> 03:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
um one of the challenges we have for new
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
Housing Development is the lack of new
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
water and sewer and um being able to
 
03:50:27.950 --> 03:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
help in that especially if it's if
 
03:50:29.469 --> 03:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
you're doing this and helping out
 
03:50:31.389 --> 03:50:31.399 align:start position:0%
communities so that they can have more
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
water and sewer and build more homes um
 
03:50:36.189 --> 03:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
that that is a big benefit and we want
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're bringing
 
03:50:39.950 --> 03:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
Community benefit as well um Beyond just
 
03:50:41.790 --> 03:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that we don't want more mothers
 
03:50:44.189 --> 03:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
having their sons um have cannabis that
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
they bought on on the street that was
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
contaminated with fentanyl let's also
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
address some of the real world issues
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
that we can do with State
 
03:50:54.750 --> 03:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
funds yeah I think we probably have
 
03:50:58.590 --> 03:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
water sewer stuff elsewhere in the state
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
okay so let's go on to that's so this is
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
a new fund I didn't realize that yes
 
03:51:06.510 --> 03:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
that is created on the bottom of page 33
 
03:51:08.790 --> 03:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I see that now all right good so
 
03:51:10.990 --> 03:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
let's go on to the next one um well
 
03:51:12.950 --> 03:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about the next one
 
03:51:16.189 --> 03:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh number four 5 % for broad Aid to
 
03:51:18.510 --> 03:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities where they have a store
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
right okay so this is a kickback similar
 
03:51:25.870 --> 03:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
to uh meals and and rooms rentals tax
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
guess as opposed to the idea of just
 
03:51:30.630 --> 03:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
taking 1% of whatever is collected off
 
03:51:32.710 --> 03:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
the top and giving it to the communities
 
03:51:34.830 --> 03:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
this actually this depending on the tax
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
rate I know it's not going to be called
 
03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
a tax but depending on that rate it's
 
03:51:40.269 --> 03:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
close to the Same by delivering that
 
03:51:44.149 --> 03:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
five that 5% back okay and then uh next
 
03:51:45.550 --> 03:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
one Public
 
03:51:50.269 --> 03:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
Safety um for drug recognition experts
 
03:51:54.590 --> 03:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
and driving enforcement and so on
 
03:51:54.600 --> 03:51:56.910 align:start position:0%
and driving enforcement and so on
um

03:51:56.910 --> 03:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:59.389 --> 03:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
okay do you do you think this bill
 
03:52:02.429 --> 03:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
causes such problems no I think that
 
03:52:04.030 --> 03:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
most of the people who may not use
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis in the most responsible manner
 
03:52:07.630 --> 03:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
don't really care whether it's legal or
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
not when they purchase it um if you
 
03:52:12.429 --> 03:52:12.439 align:start position:0%
don't care about um consuming and
 
03:52:14.149 --> 03:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
driving you probably don't care about
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
WEA or not it's legal within the state
 
03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
so that will help address an a problem
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we already have in our
 
03:52:23.790 --> 03:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
communities okay so and then the last
 
03:52:25.710 --> 03:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
one is the
 
03:52:30.269 --> 03:52:30.279 align:start position:0%
um HHS children's Behavioral Health is
 
03:52:31.349 --> 03:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
that just
 
03:52:33.710 --> 03:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
another you know nice to have kind of
 
03:52:35.550 --> 03:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
thing well I mean that's one of the
 
03:52:37.510 --> 03:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
areas when you look at it and if you
 
03:52:39.910 --> 03:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
have children that have ongoing issues
 
03:52:41.670 --> 03:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
they may be more likely that if they
 
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
haven't addressed those as they become
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
adults they me choose to self-medicate
 
03:52:49.189 --> 03:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
with something and rather than dealing
 
03:52:51.790 --> 03:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
with people um trying to trying to deal
 
03:52:53.469 --> 03:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
with a problem let's try and make sure
 
03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
that we're addressing our kids and
 
03:52:56.070 --> 03:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're taking care of
 
03:52:58.189 --> 03:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
them um especially because this is the
 
03:52:59.950 --> 03:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
sort of thing that can be used for more
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
intensive children that need more help
 
03:53:05.469 --> 03:53:05.479 align:start position:0%
and are the ones that really are most at
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
risk for negative lifetime
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
outcomes so let me just say in general
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to all of this kind of
 
03:53:17.830 --> 03:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
automatic spending our job as the
 
03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee is to take the state's
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
resour financial resources and allocate
 
03:53:27.429 --> 03:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
them to the current needs of the of the
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
state and we do this you know every two
 
03:53:33.309 --> 03:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
years and I think you know reasonably
 
03:53:36.469 --> 03:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
well and all of these kind of people the
 
03:53:38.309 --> 03:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
behavioral health and the drug and
 
03:53:42.070 --> 03:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol program etc etc they all come to
 
03:53:44.510 --> 03:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
to us with their needs and and we
 
03:53:48.189 --> 03:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
balance those with our resources and
 
03:53:51.389 --> 03:53:51.399 align:start position:0%
putting specific numbers we don't know
 
03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
that 5% or $5 million or any particular
 
03:53:59.070 --> 03:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
number today is the number that's needed
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
five years from now right or even next
 
03:54:06.149 --> 03:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
year and so what this does is it gives
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
the people that spend this money an
 
03:54:13.110 --> 03:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
expectation that I will be getting X for
 
03:54:16.189 --> 03:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
my program and and often we have to
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
change X to something else and and it
 
03:54:22.469 --> 03:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
just adds to The Angst of the of the
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
whole situation so so I'm personally
 
03:54:27.870 --> 03:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
just I mean this is discussion but I'm
 
03:54:30.750 --> 03:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm opposed to all this kind of kind
 
03:54:30.760 --> 03:54:31.790 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm opposed to all this kind of kind
of

03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:54:34.389 --> 03:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
stuff with that I'm not my question
 
03:54:35.950 --> 03:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
would be in something that you don't
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
know the size of the market how do you
 
03:54:39.630 --> 03:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
know how much to give for the drug
 
03:54:41.790 --> 03:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
recognition experts and
 
03:54:44.670 --> 03:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
others right but we we certainly know
 
03:54:47.870 --> 03:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
that better the year before we need it
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
than we do today when there's not going
 
03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
to be any sales for two years you see
 
03:54:54.590 --> 03:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
what I mean so so saying these are round
 
03:54:58.110 --> 03:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
numbers 5% 10% the right number is
 
03:55:02.070 --> 03:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
probably 6.7% or you know some not
 
03:55:03.750 --> 03:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
percents but I mean some number of
 
03:55:08.110 --> 03:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars and so we certainly
 
03:55:10.429 --> 03:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
the year before we need to spend the
 
03:55:13.189 --> 03:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
money that's the best time to decide how
 
03:55:15.990 --> 03:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
to spend the money not
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
today I look forward to working you with
 
03:55:20.110 --> 03:55:20.120 align:start position:0%
you when it's uh no longer federally
 
03:55:21.550 --> 03:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited just to put it right into
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
General funds if that's the best
 
03:55:28.110 --> 03:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
idea further questions for
 
03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:30.590 align:start position:0%
idea further questions for
representative

03:55:30.590 --> 03:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:55:34.830 --> 03:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
lean seeing none thank you thank you I
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
would like to call in representative
 
03:55:39.710 --> 03:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
Maguire to offer his
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I think this is
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
and again we will be holding a public
 
03:55:49.870 --> 03:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
hearing um on this amendment has hand
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:59.880 --> 03:56:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
Wednesday

03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
03:56:05.590 --> 03:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it's
 
03:56:07.750 --> 03:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
crazy right would you like me to sit
 
03:56:12.070 --> 03:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:15.670 --> 03:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right so this is
 
03:56:18.309 --> 03:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
um let me just talk about slightly
 
03:56:20.349 --> 03:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
what's what's going on behind the scenes
 
03:56:23.030 --> 03:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
um the uh we're in discussions with both
 
03:56:30.870 --> 03:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh the senate in particular Senator Abus
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
and the governor's representative um
 
03:56:33.439 --> 03:56:34.630 align:start position:0%
and the governor's representative um
Harold

03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
Harold
 
03:56:38.429 --> 03:56:38.439 align:start position:0%
Parker over what their requirements are
 
03:56:40.510 --> 03:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
for this kind of
 
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
the the political reality is that that
 
03:56:54.389 --> 03:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
in any situation any negotiation it's
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
the person who cares the least who has
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
the most power okay the one who's
 
03:57:03.189 --> 03:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
willing to walk away is the one who can
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
make decisions in in any
 
03:57:08.550 --> 03:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
negotiation and traditionally in this
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
area that's the
 
03:57:13.830 --> 03:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
governor um with the second Senate being
 
03:57:17.830 --> 03:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
second secondary and the house tertiary
 
03:57:21.309 --> 03:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
because we pass things year after year
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
after year and it stopped somewhere
 
03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
along the way in those other bodies so
 
03:57:28.990 --> 03:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
because they want this the least they
 
03:57:32.469 --> 03:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
essentially have the most um political
 
03:57:35.349 --> 03:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
power so this amendment is the one
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
handed to me by the senator abis and he
 
03:57:43.950 --> 03:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
created it in in close con consultation
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
with the governor now just before this
 
03:57:50.229 --> 03:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
hearing I hear from Senator abis there
 
03:57:53.229 --> 03:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
are more changes coming so so this is
 
03:57:56.070 --> 03:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
the basic structure they want but
 
03:57:58.750 --> 03:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be you know detail this
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
detail that other
 
03:58:00.600 --> 03:58:02.309 align:start position:0%
detail that other
changes

03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:58:02.319 --> 03:58:04.750 align:start position:0%
changes
um

03:58:04.750 --> 03:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:08.030 --> 03:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
and if you want to ask me personally if
 
03:58:13.590 --> 03:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
I think this is the best way to um to
 
03:58:16.870 --> 03:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
handle this situation the answer is no
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
um but if you ask me do I think the
 
03:58:24.149 --> 03:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
amendment from representative
 
03:58:26.830 --> 03:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
Leon uh will get through the next two
 
03:58:30.990 --> 03:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
steps the answer is also no right so so
 
03:58:33.469 --> 03:58:33.479 align:start position:0%
I believe them when they tell me this is
 
03:58:35.950 --> 03:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
what they want and very little changes
 
03:58:39.870 --> 03:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
from this are possible now the amendment
 
03:58:42.990 --> 03:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
as it comes to us specifically among and
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
I read off those requirements from them
 
03:58:47.149 --> 03:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
last time right but among those
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
requirements are not the financial
 
03:58:52.349 --> 03:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
aspects right so the the stuff we have
 
03:58:55.189 --> 03:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
just been talking about the 10% the 5%
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff those are not as
 
03:59:00.670 --> 03:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
far as I can understand key to those
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
other people so those are things we
 
03:59:07.349 --> 03:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
certainly can change and I actually I'll
 
03:59:09.750 --> 03:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
just do it I guess if that's the sense
 
03:59:11.429 --> 03:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
of the commit I mean what's the sense of
 
03:59:14.590 --> 03:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
the committee as far as those it are
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
concerned do you agree with me that that
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
budgeting should not happen in in the
 
03:59:23.870 --> 03:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
rsas it should happen in our
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
committee I see some nodding
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
nodding not so sure
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
shrugs okay so you know so I when I come
 
03:59:35.830 --> 03:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
up with that is not a key feature for
 
03:59:38.189 --> 03:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
those other group groups as far as I can
 
03:59:42.030 --> 03:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
understand so I would take remove those
 
03:59:45.149 --> 03:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
things okay
 
03:59:47.229 --> 03:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
so I did reach out to the governor today
 
03:59:49.870 --> 03:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
and invited him to join us at 1:00 but I
 
03:59:52.429 --> 03:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
don't see him there yet so
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh but there are a number of things uh
 
03:59:56.910 --> 03:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
and again we're going to discuss this at
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
a public hearing next week but uh some
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the things that come to mind that are
 
04:00:05.149 --> 04:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
non-budgetary in this is U the senator
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
when he was here he said he wanted
 
04:00:08.269 --> 04:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
people to
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
U be charged with with a misdemeanor if
 
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
they were caught for a second time you
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
said that was a line in the sand for him
 
04:00:17.710 --> 04:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
is that how do you feel about that
 
04:00:21.070 --> 04:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
particular I dis I strongly dislike that
 
04:00:24.229 --> 04:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay so so my attitude on this whole
 
04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
thing so all right let's go back to my
 
04:00:29.189 --> 04:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
original comment about when you don't
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
care you have more more negotiation
 
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
Mobility so for for the past 15 years up
 
04:00:38.429 --> 04:00:38.439 align:start position:0%
to two weeks ago I was in the camp of
 
04:00:41.070 --> 04:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll vote for whatever it is right
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm in favor of liberal Li alization
 
04:00:49.269 --> 04:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
of this of this area um but now I've
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
started to actually read these
 
04:00:54.910 --> 04:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
bills and they're full of junk like like
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
what you just mentioned you know so I'm
 
04:01:00.309 --> 04:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
moving toward the don't care category
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
and therefore maybe have more say I
 
04:01:05.670 --> 04:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't know but but the point is but the
 
04:01:08.229 --> 04:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
point is this particular thing is really
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
does bother me because I don't want as
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
part of a liberalization effort to have
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
more people in jail for for cannabis
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
than we have today I mean it doesn't
 
04:01:26.070 --> 04:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
make any sense at all right and so um
 
04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
and so the situation today is really not
 
04:01:31.830 --> 04:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
that bad because because it's it's all
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
either violations or maybe Class B
 
04:01:37.710 --> 04:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor which is fine only and and
 
04:01:40.750 --> 04:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
essentially not only that but the but
 
04:01:43.229 --> 04:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement is not enforcing it
 
04:01:46.830 --> 04:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
right so I I spoke to uh police in my
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
town and they tell me that 20 years ago
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
they were making 400 arrests a year of
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
all kinds in my town and um today it's
 
04:01:57.600 --> 04:01:58.630 align:start position:0%
all kinds in my town and um today it's
about

04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:02:03.630 --> 04:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
125 and a big difference is is cannabis
 
04:02:06.830 --> 04:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
they used to they used to if they saw a
 
04:02:08.870 --> 04:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
pipe in your car and it had a little
 
04:02:11.550 --> 04:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
sticky residue in it okay you're going
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
to jail you know but today don't even
 
04:02:16.269 --> 04:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
bother you know you could have a a
 
04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
shopping bag from Maine you know they
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't care right so um so not only is it
 
04:02:25.510 --> 04:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
only a violation today but it's a non
 
04:02:28.830 --> 04:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
non enforced violation in the most for
 
04:02:31.950 --> 04:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
the most part so so going back to a
 
04:02:35.790 --> 04:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
class A misdemeanor I mean that's really
 
04:02:35.800 --> 04:02:37.429 align:start position:0%
class A misdemeanor I mean that's really
silly

04:02:37.429 --> 04:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
silly
 
04:02:40.349 --> 04:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
um but you
 
04:02:42.990 --> 04:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
know so I would take that out if it was
 
04:02:44.830 --> 04:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
up to me
 
04:02:46.830 --> 04:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin some
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
comments I I guess my comment
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
is this isn't really our
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment this is a Amendment of the
 
04:02:58.510 --> 04:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
other body
 
04:03:01.550 --> 04:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
socalled and I don't know what business
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
we have with it I don't know why we're
 
04:03:03.600 --> 04:03:04.630 align:start position:0%
we have with it I don't know why we're
doing

04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
it can I I'll explain all right let me
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
explain so the thing
 
04:03:15.229 --> 04:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
is what the other body can do or as I
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
understand it is they can pass this
 
04:03:22.830 --> 04:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
whatever we give them on the floor okay
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
but they can't
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
debate you know um this fund that fun
 
04:03:30.120 --> 04:03:31.630 align:start position:0%
debate you know um this fund that fun
10%

04:03:31.630 --> 04:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
10%
 
04:03:34.830 --> 04:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
5% misdemeanors all this kind of stuff
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the Senate right and and
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
they can't debate it obviously you can't
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
debate with the governor it's it's a yes
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
or no so if we're get into details on
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
what might actually
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
pass this is the place this is almost
 
04:03:56.349 --> 04:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
the only place where that can happen um
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
and and so if you don't want sort of a
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
back room take it or leave it these are
 
04:04:04.510 --> 04:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
the features kind of thing if you want
 
04:04:08.469 --> 04:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
to actually talk about specifics it has
 
04:04:11.510 --> 04:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be here in public and I that's what I
 
04:04:14.110 --> 04:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
would prefer to to see happen so that's
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
why we're doing it this
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
way further comments
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
Jerry no they answered my question I I
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not for all those separate
 
04:04:29.630 --> 04:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
sure so I have a question representative
 
04:04:34.990 --> 04:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
Maguire as we saw when the senator was
 
04:04:38.910 --> 04:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
here a week ago the amount of money
 
04:04:41.110 --> 04:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
they're looking for is substantially
 
04:04:43.149 --> 04:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
higher than the bill that is in the
 
04:04:43.159 --> 04:04:44.389 align:start position:0%
higher than the bill that is in the
house

04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:04:46.910 --> 04:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm just seeing it now page 37 of
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers on starting on line
 
04:04:56.149 --> 04:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
27 9.6 mil8 mil 500,000 I think it adds
 
04:04:59.429 --> 04:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:04.590 --> 04:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
million do we have 37 at the bottom line
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
27 yeah so those are twoyear numbers I
 
04:05:11.670 --> 04:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
think versus a onee number other twoyear
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
one one is one the
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
2024 June of 24 right but that's the
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
first year which I think is equivalent
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
to this other Bill the other one is for
 
04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
the next year and and uh
 
04:05:26.960 --> 04:05:31.189 align:start position:0%
the next year and and uh
2025

04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
right so whereas I think the the current
 
04:05:36.990 --> 04:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
bill is just for the one year right then
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:42.640 --> 04:05:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
year

04:05:47.590 --> 04:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
the eight in the first bill our the
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
house position is 8 million for 25 in
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
this vill they've got 9 million for 24
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
and 8 million for 25 and that's oh okay
 
04:06:04.030 --> 04:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
I guess and I'm following up on what you
 
04:06:05.910 --> 04:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
said earlier which I certainly agree
 
04:06:09.870 --> 04:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
with that we have a responsibility to
 
04:06:13.070 --> 04:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
manage the state's funds as best we can
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot lot of money here at
 
04:06:17.670 --> 04:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
stake absolutely um before we receive
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
even a dime of
 
04:06:24.510 --> 04:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
profit right so it looks
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
like this bill accelerates this the
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
startup of this program you see what I
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
mean because because in represent June
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
24 June of 24 right whereas
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
representative lons doesn't spend the 8
 
04:06:41.550 --> 04:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
million until June
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
2025 what are we saying that the the
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment you're offering at the first
 
04:06:49.790 --> 04:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
year will be 9.6 and the second year 8
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
million that's what it sounds like
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's what it looks like to me so I'm
 
04:06:55.389 --> 04:06:55.399 align:start position:0%
assuming that the source of these
 
04:06:58.269 --> 04:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
numbers is the Liquor Commission so we
 
04:07:00.670 --> 04:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
could maybe uh ask him some detail he's
 
04:07:04.189 --> 04:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
shaking his head no no okay we won't put
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
you on the spot today all right I'll
 
04:07:08.830 --> 04:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll try to answer that question in
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
more detail or get yeah you could have
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
that for a public yeah good good point
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
at the next because that's a significant
 
04:07:18.149 --> 04:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
amount of money difference yeah and I
 
04:07:19.950 --> 04:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with representative
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
Maguire on the percentages for funds I
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
think anyone that comes before us should
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
make an uh a request and have a budget
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
before we just hand out 5% or 35%
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
whatever we there should be a budget
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of money there too yeah
 
04:07:39.670 --> 04:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
for potentially I'll ask about that
 
04:07:42.309 --> 04:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions of Representative
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
McGuire and his Amendment
 
04:07:46.109 --> 04:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
chairman wer I mean we're sort of
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
jumping the gun non gerine if there are
 
04:07:50.550 --> 04:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
any questions we'd try to get them
 
04:07:54.670 --> 04:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
answered before next Wednesday but
 
04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
yeah representative cells
 
04:08:00.510 --> 04:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
anything thank you Mr chair uh what
 
04:08:04.950 --> 04:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
percentage fee is in this bill for the
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh oh for that the state would get yeah
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
let you find it because uh CU ours is
 
04:08:15.550 --> 04:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
like what 10% and yeah well and I think
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's slightly higher and I believe in uh
 
04:08:21.790 --> 04:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lan's bill it was 10% and
 
04:08:23.910 --> 04:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
it would be waved for people that had
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
medical use but I don't believe that's
 
04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
the case here I believe it yeah that
 
04:08:31.750 --> 04:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
they would not wave it for medical use
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
and I believe that that's sort of a
 
04:08:35.790 --> 04:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
detail that we can get into that it
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the governor's list of of
 
04:08:41.950 --> 04:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
musthave kind of things right
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
so my issue being that uh if it's higher
 
04:08:48.590 --> 04:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
I believe I saw a figure of 12 a
 
04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
half% uh that's again non-competitive in
 
04:08:55.950 --> 04:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
my opinion and uh also if they're going
 
04:08:59.550 --> 04:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
to charge the medical uh users that's
 
04:09:02.830 --> 04:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a another I don't think that
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
that would be right for for medical use
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
to to charge them to make money off of
 
04:09:09.830 --> 04:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
that so
 
04:09:13.710 --> 04:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
sure represent evil are there ATC in the
 
04:09:13.720 --> 04:09:14.830 align:start position:0%
sure represent evil are there ATC in the
Senate

04:09:14.830 --> 04:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
version is there a pathway for atc's in
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate version I think so yeah no I
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
I haven't read it through yet yeah I
 
04:09:38.590 --> 04:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
part so I would encourage anybody that's
 
04:09:44.830 --> 04:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
out here today to come next Wednesday
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
chairman wer is generally very uh
 
04:09:50.590 --> 04:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
receptive to questions and then the
 
04:09:53.070 --> 04:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
division will hold a work session after
 
04:09:55.269 --> 04:09:55.279 align:start position:0%

04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
sorts of policy questions at that time
 
04:09:59.710 --> 04:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
and budgetary questions yeah when you
 
04:10:03.469 --> 04:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
when you read multiple bills it's this
 
04:10:06.550 --> 04:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
the details tend to you know was this
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
and this one or not in that one you know
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%

by side
 
04:10:21.309 --> 04:10:21.319 align:start position:0%
or I haven't started um yeah that's I
 
04:10:24.870 --> 04:10:24.880 align:start position:0%

04:10:29.710 --> 04:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
