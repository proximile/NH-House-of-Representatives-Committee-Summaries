00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.629 align:start position:0%
uh i do not have it but you just sent
something

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
out that specifies that phase
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
one totaled 2.5 billion
 
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
which i think we've been considering as
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
for both phases
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
and that the total including phase
 
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 align:start position:0%
two to date which is almost complete is
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire on and
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
on i'm wondering on i think that
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
we need to pass this bill but unamended
 
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
but uh i think we also owe it
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
to the legislature
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the state to
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
give an idea of
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
how much money this is going to be in
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
total and
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
when when it could show up
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh in which years and on
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
i know you've been working on that we've
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
all been working on that
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh on but we have a fiscal note from dra
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
which i think was
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
essentially coming out at around 2.5
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't it i'd like to hear from dra
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
where they think we're going on that
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
knowing that the total is 3.7
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
when they have given us some timing
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
information already but
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
on whether that changes their fiscal
 
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
on whether that changes their fiscal
note

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%

thank you it would be good if it could
also

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
include some kind of estimate of the
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
timing it looks like most of this
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
is going to come due next year and the
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
year after
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
we will have something on the timing the
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
and we should have that
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
finished tomorrow also
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
because that timing for everything
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
associated with ppp
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative brownlee followed by
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
i know that's that's what i wanted to
 
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:33.509 align:start position:0%
i know that's that's what i wanted to
say

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you and um
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
i i too uh look forward to voting
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
this bill out unamended um
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh following from
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
federal policy on this program as a
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
stimulus bill
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
that has on the whole worked well
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
and i think for new hampshire to go off
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
in a different direction would be a bad
 
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.910 align:start position:0%
in a different direction would be a bad
idea

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
so on that score i'll be uh
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
i look forward to going into executive
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
session on this i do want to say on
 
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.550 align:start position:0%
session on this i do want to say on
revenues

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
that um yes absolutely we need to look
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
at those and calculate those
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
as best we can but i emphasize as best
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
because there's a great deal we do not
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
know about
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh the way in which the degree to which
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
taxes have been paid on forgiven or
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
anticipated forgiven ppp loans
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk more about that tomorrow
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
i look forward to that discussion
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
but i want to put a big question mark
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
atop the other figures that have been
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the ppp
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
loan program it's a lot of money that
 
00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.069 align:start position:0%
loan program it's a lot of money that
has

00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
flowed to the state as
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
originally as loans and that's for sure
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
we don't know what it's translated to in
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
anticipated uh
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
payments of business profits tax um
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
so that's my my thought thank you
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives anybody else
 
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.829 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives anybody else
having

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
additional information and they want to
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
saying none then going to
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative margie smith
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this question
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
um might show that i'm
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
a trespasser here today and that i don't
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
know enough but
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
i am curious as to the path
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
that the federal funds take
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
when they come into the state
 
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.269 align:start position:0%
when they come into the state
is

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
does this money follow the traditional
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
route that exists exist historically
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
or does it go um
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
through the governor rather
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
than through other um repositories
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is a p that has to do with the ppp
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
forth to a bank
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge does not go to the
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
state it goes
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
as a result of the bank dealing with the
 
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:34.710 align:start position:0%
as a result of the bank dealing with the
treasury

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
and the treasury sends the money to the
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
business thank you very much
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
for uh making that clear to me i
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the chairman
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
if i could the sba is the contact in
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
between the banks
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
and the treasury that is correct small
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
business association
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
administration mr chairman i have a
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
question for uh representative
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
hold your question until i finish okay
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
the s as far as representative
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
hill and representative smith the sba is
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
the ones
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
that will give the approval has been
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
used for its intended purpose if they
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
get the loan
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
and they don't use it for
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
the purpose that can be forgiven and it
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
will not be forgiven it will be taxed
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
if they use it for wages enough things
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
to support that
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
then it will be forgiven so
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
the sba plays an important part of
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes okay my question was
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
um i had the feds giving us
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
1.7 billion in ppp
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
loans uh representative almighty said
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
3.7 billion is is that the current
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
figure that the feds are giving to the
 
00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.030 align:start position:0%
figure that the feds are giving to the
con

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
con
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire when you look at
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
at both the first
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
round and the second round it amounts to
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
the 3.7
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i could on representative

meeting

if i could ask a question to the chair i
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
believe if the loan is not
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
forgiven it is still alone they have to
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
pay it back
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
and it is not taxable
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
that we don't tax loans that they're
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
paying back
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
that i'm not an accountant so i'm going
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
dra could and that's a good question to
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
but representative elliott that email
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
that was sent to
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
billion dollars for the second round
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
and 2.56 for the first round a total of
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr jim representative
 
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr jim representative
spillsberg

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
sorry for the mute uh yes representative
 
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.230 align:start position:0%
sorry for the mute uh yes representative
olney

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
olney
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh a loan is not a taxable event
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
it's the forgiveness of the loan that
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
creates the taxable event
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
thank you that's what i was trying to
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
to get so we
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
we do have carol and lear in the
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
attendees and
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's great that we have such a broad
 
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.749 align:start position:0%
it's great that we have such a broad
breath

00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
breath
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
of talent on this committee
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
one person doesn't know the answer and
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
we've got some expertise and
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
another person okay represent a health
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh do i understand
 
00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.269 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh do i understand
from

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
prior conversations that at this present
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
time we don't
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
know um how many businesses and how many
 
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:33.990 align:start position:0%
know um how many businesses and how many
dollars

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
have been forgiven um and how many
 
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.790 align:start position:0%
have been forgiven um and how many
dollars

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
remain as a loan that is correct
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
because you get the loan
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
and then you use it or wages and all
 
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.670 align:start position:0%
and then you use it or wages and all
that

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
then you apply for the forgiveness and
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
that comes
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
further down the line and so we won
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
on this first section of loans which was
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
they won't hit the dra
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
this fall or even they might even be
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman quick follow-up
 
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman quick follow-up
yes

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
um is it true
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
is there a timetable for when a business
 
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.309 align:start position:0%
is there a timetable for when a business
owner

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
owner
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
will know when
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
that loan is uh is forgiven or not
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
and and does that exceed the time
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
frame when um taxes need to be filed
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
that would be a good question for
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
tomorrow thank you
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative yes uh
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
our sense is that most of the loans will
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
be forgiven uh
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
we could talk to the dra they most of
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
the businesses
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
understand what they have to do to have
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
their loan forgiven and that's spend the
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
money appropriately
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh they had to spend there was there
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
were strings around that money
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
as to how it could be spent and i think
 
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.070 align:start position:0%
as to how it could be spent and i think
and

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
i think the dra could weigh in may
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
possibly right now about
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh their sense uh in the math that they
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
did to come up with the
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
the cost of 99.4 million dollars
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh that they've they figured a certain
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of the loans that would be
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
forgiven in that math
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
and i think it was a pretty high
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
percentage of almost all
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we can hear from them right now
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
can you um janine can you
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
let carol and
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
carolyn good morning mr
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
chair carolyn lear assistant
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the new hampshire
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
department of revenue
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
so if i understand representative hill's
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
question i think it has
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
two parts the first being that we have
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
presumed in our fiscal impact statement
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
that 100 of all ppp
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
loans will ultimately be forgiven
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
um although a
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
large percentage of ppp loans
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
have not been submitted for forgiveness
 
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.110 align:start position:0%
have not been submitted for forgiveness
yet

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
for those um for those ones that have
 
00:19:59.039 --> 00:19:59.669 align:start position:0%
for those um for those ones that have
been

00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
submitted for forgiveness only a very
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
very small less than i think two or
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
have been denied forgiveness so i think
 
00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:10.149 align:start position:0%
have been denied forgiveness so i think
that's

00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
likely a somewhat reasonable assumption
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we've made
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
there our timing analysis
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
does make some assumptions
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
about when those loans will ultimately
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
be forgiven
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
um i think at a very high level
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
um for the first issuance of ppp
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
loans we've assumed that those loans
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
have or will be forgiven um
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
in short order and then for the
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
second issuance we've assumed a bit more
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
of an extended period
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
for those loans to be forgiven
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
recipients can submit their application
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
for forgiveness as soon as they have
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
spent the money
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
and do they have a time limit on
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
submitting those applications
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know the answer to that
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think they have a natural time limit
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the repayment terms
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
they certainly want to get
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
it forgiven um quickly but i don't know
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
if they actually have a deadline i'm
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure they do i just don't have it handy
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay reps and all me
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on the
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
the phase one had a deadline for
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
the sba to approve
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
forgiveness i believe of the end of last
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
year there was a major problem
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
in that the guidance was unclear enough
 
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.549 align:start position:0%
in that the guidance was unclear enough
that

00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
sba and the banks that were supposed to
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
submit the applications for the
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
applicants on could not
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do it well enough
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
and and sba how to
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
approve them and pass the money down
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
well enough
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
so if there was a considerable delay on
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
that and phase
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
one apparently now is on track
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
to to get through the rest of phase one
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
and phase two didn't have i think had
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
pretty similar almost completely
 
00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:28.549 align:start position:0%
pretty similar almost completely
identical

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
identical
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh criteria so it should be going
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
faster but um all of these you have to
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
spend the money
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
beforehand and then you have to go to
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
the back to the bank
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
and ask them to fill out the correct
 
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.310 align:start position:0%
and ask them to fill out the correct
forms

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
forms
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
so uh it it has been
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
a lot more delayed than the original
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
legislation said and they seem to have
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so do i understand
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
that there will be
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
some form of carry forward
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
if if the approval
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
arrives after the time at which
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
a business that extends their
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
filing period uh it doesn't receive that
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
approval of their forgiveness
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
carolyn thank you for the question
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative so our analysis
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
assumes that the loan would um
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
would have been reported in income in
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
the year the forgiveness is
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
actually received um we talked quite
 
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.390 align:start position:0%
actually received um we talked quite
extensively

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
with the committee about the fact that
 
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.190 align:start position:0%
with the committee about the fact that
many

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will have reported the
 
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.310 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will have reported the
expenses

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
in one year and the forgiveness
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
in a later year and that in that
 
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.350 align:start position:0%
in a later year and that in that
scenario

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
the year when the expenses were reported
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
would likely
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
generate an nol that would be carried
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
forward to offset the income
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
in a later year
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
any other information
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
or questions that the committee members
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
have before we go into the executive
 
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.149 align:start position:0%
have before we go into the executive
session

00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see any races so we will go into
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 3 and i'll recognize
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%

motion please representative romney
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just want to say
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we as a committee have
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
done much fact-finding and discussion on
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury challenges
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
saul with with the introduction of his
 
00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.470 align:start position:0%
saul with with the introduction of his
amendment

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
which forced us to examine in greater
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
detail the ramifications of this bill
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
we all heard compelling testimony from
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
individual businesses and the various
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
chambers of commerce's
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
who support passage of senate bill 3.
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
the chamber did a great job in reminding
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
us all
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
what a crisis we were in last spring and
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
what a lifeline the ppp
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
program was to so many of our our
 
00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:13.830 align:start position:0%
program was to so many of our our
businesses

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
they reminded us that this program was a
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
relief program
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
for me this simply comes down to should
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
we be taxing relief money or not
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
i've concluded passage of sp3 is the
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
right thing to do
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
and that we should not tax relief money
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
from uh we heard from the from the dra
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
that passing sb3 will reduce
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
future tax revenues by 99.4 million
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
dollars given our business tax revenues
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
as of today are running 172.7 million
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
above budget and that's made up of
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
april april year to date 175.5 million
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
reduced to 18.3 through three
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
million of anomalous uh revenues from
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then adding may as of today
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
may is running 16.5 million above budget
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
so we're continuing to have another good
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
a month of revenue so
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
we're that that equals 172.7 uh may
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
2050 at a date uh over it over
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
budget revenue for business taxes
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
with that there is no question in my
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
mind that the state
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
can afford to cover the the lost revenue
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
in future years due to
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
the passage of sb3 this can happen if
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
the 172.7 million is managed properly
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
which i am confident it will be
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
hopefully you will all join me
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
voting yes on sb3 as we do our part
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
in helping new hampshire businesses
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
rebound post
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%

uh what he has just said in support of
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
passage of sb3
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
unamended and i think the
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh to begin with i do want to say uh
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
a big thank you to our chair for
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
presiding over a very careful and
 
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.190 align:start position:0%
presiding over a very careful and
thorough

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
thorough
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh review of this spill and its
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
ramifications is a complicated
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
subject and uh we've certainly explored
 
00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:33.350 align:start position:0%
subject and uh we've certainly explored
it

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
and uh with the able help of
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury who
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
who dove into this and raised questions
 
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.950 align:start position:0%
who dove into this and raised questions
that

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
needed to be explored so thank you
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
to everyone i guess for
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
this endeavor which is a serious
 
00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:53.750 align:start position:0%
this endeavor which is a serious
appropriate

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
way for the legislative committee to
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
proceed on a
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
a difficult bill and i think
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
we're doing just the right thing we're
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
carrying through on a federal program
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
that was designed to respond to
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and its economic uh
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
its adverse economic effects both uh
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
both already felt at the time of passage
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the ppp
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
program uh or anticipated or feared
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
and um it's uh it's played out very well
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
for many of our businesses
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
and uh it needs to be immediately added
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
for many of those business employees who
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
were able to be kept on payroll
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
continue to get their health insurance
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
as the as we made our way through the
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the ppp program made all
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
that possible
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government decided at the
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
outset that they would look at this as a
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
stimulus program as an investment
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
in the economy and not as a
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
program that would play out in any
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
particular way
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the profit and loss statements of
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
corporations or businesses
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
but rather as a broad stimulus and
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
for that reason they chose not to to
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
tax the loan program when it became a
 
00:30:15.679 --> 00:30:17.029 align:start position:0%
tax the loan program when it became a
forgiven

00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
loan program for when forgiveness
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
entered into the picture
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that was exactly the right
 
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.549 align:start position:0%
and i think that was exactly the right
choice

00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
of 40 41 i'm not sure that your number
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
states have agreed and
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
and gone down the same pathway as the
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
federal government with
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
their local business taxes there are a
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
number of a few other states
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh above that 41 uh
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
number that simply don't have a business
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
tax so
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's really a most most states are on
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
board with this approach
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's good that new hampshire is
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
about to go down that road i hope it is
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to go down that road with the
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
support of the full house
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
so i look forward to voting on this bill
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
favorably to send it forward to the
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
house floor
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on first i want to
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
echo representative ames thanks
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
for the work you and
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
all of us many uh have done
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
to examine the implications of this bill
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
and to underline that we need
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
to make it clear to the house and the
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
senate and the governor
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
on that that 99 million
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
number of cost is very approximate
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
and that it is very
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
pro and it is very likely that whatever
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
money that
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
is is within the surplus that we are
 
00:31:59.120 --> 00:31:59.750 align:start position:0%
is is within the surplus that we are
seeing

00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
for the business taxes and needs
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
to be saved not spent because we're
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay it back
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
representative spielsberg
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i very much
 
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i very much
appreciate

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
the committee's patience and allowing me
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
to ask extensive questions
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
and make comments i appreciate the
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
collaboration i've seen across
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
the entire committee and the quality
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
and thoughtfulness of the entire
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
discussion i'm glad we gave it
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
the extra time uh it certainly deserved
 
00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:39.190 align:start position:0%
the extra time uh it certainly deserved
that

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
so i think we've pieced everything out
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day it's not a
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
mathematical equation
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's a value judgment so
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
we've gone through four revised fiscal
 
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.590 align:start position:0%
we've gone through four revised fiscal
notes

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
notes
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
we extensively debated an amendment
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
i had another one prepared along the
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
lines of virginia's limitation
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
and decided not to advance it
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
because i think at the end of the day
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
we've received more revenue than planned
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
we can afford to give some back and i
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
view this as a
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
further stimulus and effectively a
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
one-time discount
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
on the business profit tax rates so
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate all the responses i've
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
had to my questions
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm very comfortable to vote yes on
 
00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:35.350 align:start position:0%
and i'm very comfortable to vote yes on
sb3
