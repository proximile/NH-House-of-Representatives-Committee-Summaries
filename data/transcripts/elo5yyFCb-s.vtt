00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody Welcome to
 
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
Transportation before we get started
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
with our public hearings if I can ask
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
represent of sellers to lead us in the
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:51.670 align:start position:0%
represent of sellers to lead us in the
pledge

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh being 9:31 I'm
 
00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
1063 FN Rel relative to motor vehicle
 
00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
speed within 10 mph of the speed limit
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes the prime
 
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair this bill
 
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
affects when someone can be stopped or
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
ticketed for speeding now how many of us
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
went at least one mile above the speed
 
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
limit on the way here today you don't
 
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
have to answer I expect the answer is
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
every single one of us um which leads to
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
the question if lawmakers aren't
 
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
following the law how can we expect the
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
public to um so obviously police aren't
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
pulling people over for doing 31 and a
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
30 um but the question is at what point
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
do they pull someone over so I expect
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
police will be here to testify against
 
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
the bill and I think you might want to
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
ask them hey what's the average speed
 
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
someone's doing above the speed limit
 
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
before you pull them over and maybe the
 
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
minimum speed um above the speed limit
 
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
that you would pull someone over um
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
because I think that might be pretty in
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
line with what this spill actually uh
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
would attempt to do the problem with
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
allowing police to pull people over when
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing 31 to 30 is at least to
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
pretextual stops so I don't want to give
 
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
ulterior or impute motives on someone
 
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
but I suggest that some Police pull
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
people over for reasons other than they
 
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
might be telling that person or for
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
reasons other than what the actual speed
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
is um maybe it's night time the officer
 
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
has nothing better to do and just wants
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
to see if he smells an odor of alcohol
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
on someone's breath um maybe it's for
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
some other reasons related to the
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the driver or
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
something related to the vehicle that
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
gives an officer a hunch I'm just going
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
to stop this person but we shouldn't
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
have laws that are can be enforced in
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
such an erratic manner when it's
 
00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
literally something that pretty much
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
everyone is doing um so New Hampshire
 
00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 align:start position:0%
has a in my opinion kind of a unique
 
00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 align:start position:0%
speeding law so it's not actually
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
against the law to speed as long as
 
00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 align:start position:0%
you're what's called driving reasonably
 
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
and prudent now that's not defined um
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
but the statute goes on to say it's I
 
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
might mispronounce it Prima fascia
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
evidence that it isn't reasonable when
 
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
prudent if you are going above the speed
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
limit and it's fancy legal term
 
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
basically it's a pre uh it's a
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption so I mean if I
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
ever had someone pulled over for 31 and
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
30 I think at the end of the day judge
 
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
would agree with me that if everything
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
else is fine that hey that's a
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable impudent speed um now I think
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of so just because something's
 
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
generally reasonable doesn't always mean
 
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
it is so if there's snow on the ground
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
if it's nighttime if it's foggy a bunch
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
of rain a bunch of traffic might not be
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable to do 31 in that 30 or
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
speeding on the highway as it may be so
 
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it would say
 
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
instead of just driving in excess of the
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
speed limit that if you are within 10
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
miles or above the speed limit then that
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
in itself is reasonable prudent and I
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
think that aligns up with when officers
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
are pulling people over so I routinely
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
see people drive by officers going above
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
10 m hour above the speed limit and they
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
aren't getting pulled over um so we
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
could pick any number I happen to pick
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
10 I think that's generally where
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
officers probably pull someone over but
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
I think it a good question for people to
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
ask the police at what speed they do
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
actually pull this over but that's what
 
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 align:start position:0%
this bill does and I'm happy to answer
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
any questions about
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
it thank you sir and I apologize um any
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
committee of
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
sellers sure thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
thanks for Tak the question uh how' you
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
come up with 10 miles an hour and 10
 
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
miles an hour over 30 miles an hour is
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
quite a big difference why not use a
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
percentage like 15% over the over the
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
limit that way it's more adjustable as
 
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
the limit goes up I'm thinking like 70
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
miles an hour it be Co towards 80 and 30
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
m an hour it be what 34 you know four or
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
five miles over that's a good point um
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
that is an approach I would support that
 
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
um besides if you were to go that route
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
um perhaps other than 15 or let's just
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
say 10% um I think we generally have
 
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:12.759 align:start position:0%
like a lot of different categories so 30
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
tends to be a com common um one or 40 um
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
55 65 the issue I guess if you're
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
picking like 15% if the speed Li is 65
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to figure out what 15%
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
of that is um so if you were to go that
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
approach maybe it's better to say well
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
in 65 you can do 7
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
um or in 30 35 but um I just had to come
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
up with a number times what I came up
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
with because um but I would support any
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
approach that you guys think is
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable hand prudent any other
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
committee seeing nothing thank you very
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh next up chair
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes Dan Goodman from Triple A
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:14.069 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
good morning uh for the record uh
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
chairman WS thank you very much for
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify and members of
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
is Dan Goodman I'm the public affairs
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
manager for AAA Northern New England um
 
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here in opposition to this bill um
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
mainly for a traffic safety concern
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
speeding is a growing growing issue in
 
00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:34.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and around the country and
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
very concerned about if we allow people
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
to speed even uh more I'm I'm sure
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
someone from do will be here to explain
 
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
how they set the speed limit so when
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
we're driving down the interstate at 65
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
we should be going 65 at the most
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
perfect conditions and a lot of
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
engineering and research has gone into
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
that um we speeding is now about a third
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
of all fatalities in this country
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
right up there with alcohol impair
 
00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
driving um it is anecdotally we see it
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
every day we read
 
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
about crazy speeds on the highway
 
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
through Greenland Hampton on 95 a major
 
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
major concern we believe so to help
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of speeding we
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
have a aleaa foundation for Traffic
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
Safety down in Washington DC it's it's
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
one of the preeminent Traffic Safety
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
foundations out there and they have
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
released a couple studies over the last
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
couple years to understand how speeding
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
affects a driver how speeding affects
 
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.190 align:start position:0%
affects a driver how speeding affects
the

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle I'll just be real quick here the
 
00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:38.839 align:start position:0%
first study they looked at um looked at
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
the effects of of an injury and a crash
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
at 40 miles an hour 50 miles an hour and
 
00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
56 miles an hour the study found that
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
crash speeds increase modestly more
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
structural damage to the vehicle and
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
greater forces onto the dummy's entire
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
body resulting in increased severity of
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
injuries which canel out most Vehicle
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
Safety technology like airbags and
 
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
improved structural
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
designs um the second study looked at 12
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
roadways across the country um that some
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
that had increases speed limit and some
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
that had decreased the speed limit and
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
at 2third of the interstates that had
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
increased the speed limit um there was
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
an increased crash
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
frequency um if you've ever traveled to
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
Maine north of Portland in 2014
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
increaseed speed limit on i295 from
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
Portland to Falmouth 2014 to 2017 or 18
 
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
that was reversed in four years because
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
they saw an increased number of crashes
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
and fatalities and since then they've
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
seen fatals and crashes um I think I
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
said they saw it was an increase and so
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
they' since they've put the speedet down
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
to 65 those crashes and fatalities have
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
decreased um nationally over the last 10
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
years we've seen 77% increase in p
 
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.069 align:start position:0%
years we've seen 77% increase in p
estrian

00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
estrian
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
fatalities and with a increasing
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
contributing factor of
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
speeding um we we we release an annual
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
survey called the triaa traffic safety
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
culture index um and 61% of IND of
 
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
respondents from across the country said
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
they that they admitted to going 10
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
miles an hour over in a residential area
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
and 50% admitted to doing 15 over um on
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
the highway while almost 40% of those
 
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
same respondents um thought it was
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
unsafe Behavior
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
um so I'm happy to share any of these
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
studies um you know we know
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
that it's just a major maor traffic
 
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
safety concern and I know State Police
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
and others can talk about what some of
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
these numbers are in New Hampshire but
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
this is this isn't a positive direction
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
we have increased crashes and fatalities
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
on our roads and I don't think this a a
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
positive step so I I ask you all to
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill I'm happy to answer any
 
00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:55.959 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from the
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
you for being here um do you do not your
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
but do all Insurance adjudicators do
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
they take in consideration when they're
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
setting the rates laws like
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
this thank you for the question I I do
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
not know the answer to that but I'd be
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
happy to um to look into that so just to
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
clarify you're asking do they look at
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
actually Comm yeah
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
follow actually both the uh okay I mean
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
I know they look at density they look at
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh incidents of accidents and so on I
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
just didn't know if they also look at
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
what the local laws are
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
saying thank you for the question I'm
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
happy to look into that and get back to
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair so you
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned um
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
the safe speed limit on the highways or
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
roadways and um I've seen in my lifetime
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
where they''re gone from like 70 or 65
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
down to 55 to just to save fuel and it's
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
the same roadway H that's one how do you
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
justify that and that's what in the same
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
aspect around certain areas of lakes and
 
00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
and and local Town highways going
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
through local towns during the summer we
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
we sometimes lower the speed limit on
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
the same roadways the road hasn't
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
changed so how I'm just wondering what
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
do you think about that it's the same
 
00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
road thank you for the question um yeah
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's a whole different thing
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about lowering
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
speeds because the speed limit is the
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
maximum um speed I I I know there's
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
there I'm not as familiar in the
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
engineering that goes to a minimum speed
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
I know you're hearing a bill right after
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
this to talk about lowering these speeds
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
and that's generally because in the
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
summer months there's increased
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
pedestrians and bicyclists um and I
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
don't know what that safe minimum speed
 
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
is but we know that you know for every
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
10 miles an hour over the crash sity
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
increases so it's much safer to be going
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
slower I don't know if I fully answer
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
your question I'd be happy to maybe chat
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
afterward but have to
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
answer yeah follow up thanks so even
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
even like around the lakes and stuff we
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
lower the speed by 10 miles an hour and
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
I'm saying and I was just asking the the
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
rep before you that well what happened
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
is we had adjusted that to 15% over
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
there you know so we've already lowered
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
it 10 miles an hour the the road is safe
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
for it so why can't you you say hey four
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
or five miles over a 30 mph speed limit
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be unreasonable that's all I'm
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out would you
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
agree to that or
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
not thank you very much for the question
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's not something I've really thought
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
about but I happy to think about it a
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more and chat with you about
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
it um but it's an interesting concept
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative pandon thank
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for coming today
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
um hopefully I don't know if you can
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
answer this or not I don't know if
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
anyone here is here from dot uh my
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
experience I've worked uh as chairman of
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and nashor with multiple
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
City Engineers uh Traffic Engineers and
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh Highway dot but it's my understanding
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
that whether it's Urban compact or uh
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
class two three four highways speeds are
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
set and engineered depending on those
 
00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:32.189 align:start position:0%
set and engineered depending on those
highway

00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
highway
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
conditions um do you concur with that
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
that there is a science behind setting
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
Ste speed
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
limits thank you very much for the
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
question um completely agree with you
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
Traffic Engineers do a ton of onsite
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
research lot lots of research to to go
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
into what that maximum speed limit
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
should be um but I think that question
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
could be better answered by a
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative from do thank thank you
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair which I do have a
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
pink card for as well as Department of
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
Safety uh any other questions from the
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh that being said next

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
Michael odonnell I am the assistant
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
State traffic engineer at New Hampshire
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
do um I do have some written testimony
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
that I'll I'll pass around after this um
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
from commissioner Cass uh but I'd like
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
to just summarize it
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
um uh which is I narrowed it down to
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
Five Points uh that the commission
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to make um first of all the the
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
General Court established the
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of speed limit by
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
establishing statutory requirements for
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
um various roadway functions and also
 
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
authorize the commissioner of
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
transportation and any local
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions um to modify those values
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
on the basis of an engineering and
 
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
on the basis of an engineering and
traffic

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
investigation uh the subject bill would
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
make those previous engineering and
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
traffic investigations obsolete by
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
increasing the reasonable and prudent
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
values uh by 10 m an hour which is
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
arbitrary um second Point um New
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dot uses a robust
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
research-based and data driven
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
engineering and traffic investigation
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
process uh to evaluate speed limits uh
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
through thorough collaboration with
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
local governing agencies and enforcement
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.270 align:start position:0%
local governing agencies and enforcement
personnel

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:04.039 align:start position:0%
um speed zones that are no longer
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
reflecting the reasonable and prudent
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
maximum speed uh can be reconsidered
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
through this process and the speed
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
limits reposted
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
accordingly um that could be increasing
 
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
the speed limit or reducing the speed
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
limit uh speed limit signing is the
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate means this is the third
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
Point made in the uh written testimony
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
speed limit signing is the appropriate
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
means to inform drivers of the Prima
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
fascist speed limit to expect drivers
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
visiting from other states and other
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
places to understand that New Hampshire
 
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the maximum credible
 
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
speed limit is 10 miles an hour over the
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
posted speed limit would seem
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
us and
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive um fourth Point uh the
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires that the sign
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
display the lawful maximum speed so
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
requiring um you know the speed limit to
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
be posted 10 miles an hour below it uh
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
would not allow New Hampshire to comply
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
with the federal
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
law uh fifth point and last Point uh one
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
of the most frequent comments we get uh
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
and requests received at the New
 
00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:19.830 align:start position:0%
and requests received at the New
Hampshire

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
dot is involving traffic speeds and
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
speed limit concerns uh residents and
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
elected officials frequently ask for
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
Speed limit to be set arbitrarily 10 m
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
hour below the current posted speed uh
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
to incorporate a tolerance value um
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
however taking this action does not show
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
a similar speed reduction in the data
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
that we collect after doing um such a
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
thing uh the proposed bill would only
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
increase the pressure on the dot and
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal jurisdictions to further
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
reduce speed limits to account for the
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
new statutory tolerance
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you I can go into more
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
detail if you like and it sounded like
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir and you did have
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
written testimony you said yes I can
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
pass that around fantastic any questions
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
from the committee I see one from
 
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.390 align:start position:0%
from the committee I see one from
representative

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
Sykes thank you Mr chairman Mr odonnell
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
yes um I I tried to look at the fiscal
 
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
note and it does it has z0000 Z so it's
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
not particularly helpful but is it a far
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
leap to suggest that there will be costs
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
associated with the do having to change
 
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
any signs or is it uh in order to be in
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal law or not um
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
the uh thank you uh the the signs are
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
currently in compliance with federal
 
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.630 align:start position:0%
currently in compliance with federal
law

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
um so if this bill passes we can't meet
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
the federal law because we would always
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
have to post 10 miles an hour below the
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
speed limit and um Federal Law requires
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
that we post the speed limit for for
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
is representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Odon for
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned in your
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's a process that
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
someone can go through to get the speed
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
limits reconsidered can you speak about
 
00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:29.799 align:start position:0%
that process yeah yes uh thank you uh
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
the basic process would be that we would
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
we would want to start it off by working
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
with Municipal officials um to make sure
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
that you know rather than just one
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
person who wants people to go slower in
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
front of their
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
driveway um you know as you pass their
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
house you know isn't the only voice in
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
the room so we we usually like to go to
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
the you know the town legisl or the town
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh executive body whether it be it's
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Selectmen or or whoever it
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
might be to to try to gauge the support
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
for it uh we try to let people know that
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know once there is an engineering in
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
traffic investigation that becomes a
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
document of public record um so if the
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
engineering in traffic
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
investigation concludes that the speed
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
limit should be higher than it is um
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
that is a discoverable document that
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
could be presented in court um so if you
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
had a situation where we were
 
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
recommending a speed limit 10 miles an
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
hour greater than what is posted now and
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
the people calling us really wanted it
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
10 miles an hour
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
lower um you know that that could get
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
somebody out of a ticket potentially
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
that they that they find that document
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
but uh once we've gone through that
 
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
discussion uh we start data collection
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
we have a number of resources available
 
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
to us we have uh big data so to speak
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
probe data um that measures the speed of
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
the traffic flow um basically using
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
connected Vehicles cell phones uh things
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
like that and uh we we analyze that data
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
um we identify you know the 85th
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
percentile speed is what's commonly
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
known as the reasonable uh speed uh
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable and prudent speed we look at
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
crash data we look at uh items that
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
would consider the the character of the
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
roadway like density of driveway
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
presence or absence of pedestrian
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
traffic um you know and then we we use a
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
a program called us limits 2 um which uh
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
basically feed all that data into it and
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
it uses a a research-based
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
process um it's used in in many states
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to New Hampshire and it
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
basically spits out the recommended
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
speed limit um we are required Now by
 
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
federal law to set the speed limit
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
within 5 miles an hour of that
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh based on the 85th
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
percentile um you there are changes in
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
the works
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
um I guess I won't speak to that because
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
they haven't happened yet uh but there
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
is a lot of continuing research going on
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
limit I've got one if you don't mind
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
just to clarify everything you said for
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
to remain federally compliant we would
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
have to make new signs throughout the
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
state that are 10 miles an hour below
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
what we currently have is that what you
 
00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:39.350 align:start position:0%
what we currently have is that what you
said

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
um no it's if I said that I'm sorry
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's not what I meant uh the Federal
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
Law requires that the speed limit be
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
posted on the
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
sign so if if we have a we we would
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
never be able to meet that if this bill
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
passes we would be out of federal
 
00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.510 align:start position:0%
passes we would be out of federal
compliance

00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
that that's my point
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
so we're If This Were to pass the speed
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
limit would be 10 miles hour above
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
what's posted right
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
so how let me let me let me get away
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
from that one what happens if we're not
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
federally compliant um what does that
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
mean they they could um penalize us with
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
our federal funding um I haven't known
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
it to happen in our State uh I do know
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
of cases where it's happened in New York
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
state um but I have not seen it happen
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
here um but that would be like our our
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
funding under the transportation bill
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
which New Hampshire dot programs a lot
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
of federal money to do projects around
 
00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.230 align:start position:0%
of federal money to do projects around
the

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
state thank you any other questions from
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
the committee and keep in mind we have
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Safety in the queue did
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
I see your hand representative
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
Jes yes thank you Mr chair I'll make
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
make this quick um I'm going to show my
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
age uh and I don't expect an answer
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
right now but uh back in the 70s when we
 
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
had an energy crisis the speed limits
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
were lower 10 miles per
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
hour were was there less traffic
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
incidents back then and you don't have
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
to answer that now yeah I don't I don't
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
have that answer
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
now thank you representative
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
sellers uh thank you Mr chair and
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
apologize but going back to your
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
question uh Mr chair is if it has to be
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
stated on the sign does it have to be
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
stated in specific size I mean could it
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
be like uh two point you know print or
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah that um thanks
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
for the question the the uh federal laws
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
do require that it be a certain size for
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
type yeah follow thank you and and
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
federal law does that only apply to the
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
interstate or to State highways as well
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh thanks the um federal law applies to
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
all roadways public or private that are
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
open to public travel so that could even
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
be a parking lot for a business that's
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
public representative pland pland sorry
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr a tough one good enough
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
yeah three syllables but good job to
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
continue uh on representative s's
 
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
position or questions um I know for
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
non-moving violation a non-moving uh
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
traffic light stop sign so on there's a
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
the mcds that which are a guidelin and
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
you mentioned federal laws and such is
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
there variation on moving violations or
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
or speed limits and uh how speed limits
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
are are uh posted on certain grade roads
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
and Road densities is there a federal
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
guideline like the mcds from for Speed
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
and moving
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
violations um so thanks if I'm
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
understanding the question um you know
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
the the moving violations and how things
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
are enforced is not covered in the mutcd
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
there may be a document that department
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
of safety works with
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
um if I could clarify Mr chair yeah
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
follow up um for non-moving we've got
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
the mcds what I'm asking is for for
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
moving violations I.E setting speed
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
limits are there federal guidelines that
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
denot certain class highways certain
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
densities that the speed limits need to
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
be with these Within These
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
parameters um yes I think I understand
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
so the the mutcd is the federal law I
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
was referencing and yes uh the mutcd
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
does include guidelines for setting
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
speed limit um there are no statutory
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
type requirements like our state has in
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
federal law um that would say you know
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
for an interstate it it be this or or
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
that um you know those are those are
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
covered under our current uh speed limit
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire um but the
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
mutcd uh there is a code of federal
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
regulations associated with that that
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
adopts it as federal law uh currently um
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
and we are between mut tcds at the
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
moment the 2009 version is what we're
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
using in New Hampshire and the 2009
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
version is what requires that the speed
 
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
limit be set within 5 miles an hour of
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
the 85th percentile speed perfect thank
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
chair seeing no other questions thank
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.149 align:start position:0%

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh next
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
up chair recognize Chris Storm from the
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police uh in opposition

welcome

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'll lead off by the one that I know
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's waiting for at what point at
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
what speed on average on Interstate 93
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
posted 65 miles an hour will you
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
them I'm sorry can I get you to turn
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
your mic too please that's a great
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
question representative um the answer is
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that specifically due to
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that it is a a discretionary
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
thing amongst any law enforcement
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
officer that's out there um are people
 
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:06.519 align:start position:0%
getting stopped for 66 and a 65 I don't
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
believe so are they being ticketed for
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe so um I'm sure if
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
we looked at the the data that comes in
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
through the office of Highway Safety we
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
could probably tell you um what the
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
majority of tickets that are coming um
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
that are coming into that office are but
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
again that's discretionary towards the
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh the trooper the deputy the officer to
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
actually be allowed to lower that on the
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
side of the road too and not necessarily
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
give that individual the actual fine for
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
the speed that they're actually going
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
and actually come down that's the
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
discretion of that particular officer
 
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
Deputy or uh
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
Trooper thank you sir fair enough any
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.350 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
representative

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you on that note could you
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
could we get that data as far as the
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
high and low speeds that they have
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
pulled people over for do you have that
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
you said the actual the um I could
 
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
probably provide that from the
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety I probably um that
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
would be a DMV question for as far as um
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
they are part of the Department of
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
Safety but as far as the state police go
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
go we can probably provide you with
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
that thank you any other questions from
 
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.950 align:start position:0%
that thank you any other questions from
the

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
committee sorry yes you're on TV one day
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
and look at this representative
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
sellers trying to use the right words um
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I've noticed like in
 
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
I've traveled through the states and
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
some states have uh speed limits uh even
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
up to 80 miles an hour um under the
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
federal rules that we have here if I'm
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
not sure you're aware of them is that do
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
they give us a range for the state or in
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
each highway I mean I don't that's what
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out representative
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
um great question I don't know the
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
answer to that what I can tell you in
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire we do have the absolute
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
speed limit right so we have that 65
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
mile and then anything north of exit 17
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
on i93 you have the maximum allowable
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
speed limit or is 70 miles an hour so
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
anything posted above that or anybody
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
allowable go any higher than that is
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
according right now to 26560 our law is
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
against the law to go anything more than
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
70 miles an hour
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
further questions representative ve
 
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I think it was
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
suggested in past testimony for other
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
bills for another bill that the courts
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
don't want to see anybody objecting to a
 
00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:14.839 align:start position:0%
ticket unless it's at least 10 miles an
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
hour over or 15 miles an hour over do
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
you have difficulty Prosecuting
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
violations that are less than 10 miles
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
an hour over or within any range
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
of violation that's a great question I
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually don't I don't know the answer
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
to that what I can tell you with being
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
in court for 20s something years that um
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
as long as we've proven our case I've
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
never really had an issue with a
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
speeding ticket um you know obviously
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
for the right reasons u i and I don't
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
think I've ever seen anybody really have
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
any um issues um bringing up to the
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
judge what they what they actually saw
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
what they observed and and the reasons
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
for which they stopped that
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle okay seeing no other questions
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
much and final speaker that I have
 
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
signed up Steve zck uh
 
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
morning good morning uh I here in
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
support of the bill uh I just want to
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
encourage everybody on this committee to
 
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:15.079 align:start position:0%
check out a uh documentary about how
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
speed limits are Set uh and how CH up uh
 
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
increasing them could actually improve
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
safety the uh title of the documentary
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's in two parts it's called Uh speed
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
kills your pocketbook uh it's available
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
free on YouTube and uh I linked to it
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
and uh submitted uh written testimony
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
through the web portal so uh I hope
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
everybody checks it out um the other
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
thing is I don't necessarily think that
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
speed limits are set properly to the
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
85th percentile because if you've ever
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
been driving along in a rural New
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire town at 11: you know late late
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
at night and had a cop behind you
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
tailgating you
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
and you set your cruise control exactly
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
to the speed limit it's very
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
nerve-wracking and it seems like it's
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
suspicious to them that you're going the
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
speed limit and I've gotten pulled over
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
for going exactly the speed limit so
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's not a reason they make something
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
up but I think speed limit should
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
probably be set more to an 85th
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
percentile I know that's not exactly the
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
point of this bill but I think it's a
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction uh to EV
 
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
that'll help evaluate what
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
people really would go if they were able
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
to go at the uh speed they find it's
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
proper um and I think this bill would uh
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
help alleviate some of the really
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh unnecessarily stripped speed lims in
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
some small areas
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much we take any
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions or uh if anyone has any
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
questions actually I don't see any so
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you again very much
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's the last person I have signed
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
up to speak um so I'm going to close the
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
1063 just give us a few moments to reset
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll move
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:38:46.630 align:start position:0%
 
1550

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open up the public
 
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.910 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open up the public
hearing

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
being 10:06 on House Bill 1550
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
authorizing municipalities to reduce
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
speed limits seasonally uh chair
 
00:38:59.309 --> 00:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative eel uh the
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor good morning welcome to
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you very much Mr
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
chair um for the record my name is uh
 
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
Karen eel and I represent marac district
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
7 which is New London and
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
Newbury um I'm here uh introducing HB
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
1550 which is um um in large part A
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
reintroduction of a bill um I believe it
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
was HB 93 that was tabled last year um
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
by the house and there were some
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
concerns expressed about the bill which
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
I hope in this version of the bill um
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
I've been able to answer with a couple
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
of tweaks to the um to the
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
language so I did give you um a copy of
 
00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
my testimony um which outlines basically
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
the situation I think it's a pretty
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
simple um simple concept um I also just
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
really want to point out to you that
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
this is uh very much a bipartisan Bill
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
we have a full compliment of Democrats
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
and Republicans on um in the house and
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the Senate so I actually consider
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
this a nonpartisan um piece of
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislation which is nice um so the bill
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh would permit the seasonal reduction
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
of speed limits to 20 20 M an hour once
 
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
in uh 4 month period and the town can
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
decide on its own if it would like to
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
make this reduction or um a citizen uh
 
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
group of 10 people could provide a
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
petition to the town um I just want to
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that if the um town does get a
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
petition requested a reduction of a
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
speed limit there's actually there's
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely no responsibility on the part
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
of the town to do that reduction it just
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility to assess the
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
requests of its citizens in a way that
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
it would uh you know acknowledge the
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
request of any um citizen group um the
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
change that I made in this this time and
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
I have worked with the Department of
 
00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
Transport ation which will'll be
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
speaking to the bill later I did insert
 
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
in in the bill the requirement that um
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
to make the change in the um speed limit
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
the town governing body would have to do
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
it on the basis of an engineering and a
 
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.990 align:start position:0%
it on the basis of an engineering and a
traffic

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
investigation this sort of parallels the
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
process that the state does when it's
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
assessing um speed limits um and and the
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
other thing uh I changed and I just
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
really wanted to clarify because I think
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
there was some um uh misunderstanding
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
about this last
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
year there is no responsibility to
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
change the speed limit just because they
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
get a citizen petition it just triggers
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
a conversation about whether or not to
 
00:42:23.069 --> 00:42:23.079 align:start position:0%
do it um
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
the changes that I'm seeking through
 
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:30.559 align:start position:0%
this bill um are changes that would
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
parallel The Authority in a town to that
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
that's already granted for the state on
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
seasonally congested roads and it seems
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
to me from a local control standpoint
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
and from a taxpayer standpoint and a
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
town Safety standpoint that a town um
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
really should be given the authority to
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
have as many tools as it can logically
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
have in its toolbox to makes it make its
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
roads as safe as they can um as they can
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
be and so the situation actually arose
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
in my town where we have um we have many
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
lakes just in our town but there's one
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
in particular that's incredibly popular
 
00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:20.150 align:start position:0%
in particular that's incredibly popular
for

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
Walkers uh people pushing strollers dog
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
walkers bikers I mean you name it and
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
the road gets it's you know a lot of us
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
uh we still have these small Meandering
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
roads that are immediately by um a water
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
body they get really congested and
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're also frequently through roads
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
and so um you know there have been many
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the pedestrians
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps aren't as cautious as they uh
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
could be when they're walking and it's
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
just really helpful for the town to be
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
able to assess the situation and reduce
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
the speed limit to 20 M an hour if it
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
deems um that that makes sense along
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
with using other tools that it has um
 
00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
the bill is supported by the New
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
Association um I know they had
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
anticipated being here today but I heard
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
they had something like 40 bills or some
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
and he's here oh good
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
he's here all right I won't talk about
 
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association then
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
um uh the only other thing I wanted to
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
add here is I did provide you uh with a
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
copy of a letter and support from our
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
town manager and um you know of course
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
she collaborates with our police chief
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
and this is something that the police
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
chief is really interested in
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishing um I know that there have
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
been discussions about doing something
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
along these lines for several years it's
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
something that the towns really really
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
would appreciate um the authority to do
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
under state law to reduce it seasonally
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
and um I hope that with the changes that
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
I've made this time the committee um
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
would agree that that this makes sense
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
um for our towns and I guess uh that's
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
all I really have to say the only other
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
thing I would add is I just want to also
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
made clear that this can be an annual
 
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
assessment by the town there's
 
00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:34.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely no responsibility by the town
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
to do it any more than once and if they
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
do you know if they reduce the speed
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
limit for the 4mon period they don't
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
think it works or whatever they they
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it again but at least
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
they would be given the option so with
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
that um I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
questions you might have
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions from the
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that the petition
 
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
just triggers a
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
conversation so can you can you kind of
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
walk us through like some someone does a
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
petition or a group does a petition how
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
long would it take from petition to the
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
point of it being
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
changed I mean I suppose that would I I
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
haven't got a timeline in here again I
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
paralleled the uh State process and
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
there is somebody here from the state
 
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
who could maybe talk about this but I
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
would think that if a petition was
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
brought in in May and the folks or April
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
and the folks were really hoping to have
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
the four-month period instituted you
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
know for the summer and maybe into the
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
fall because the congestion is easily as
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
difficult in the fall as it is during
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
the summer um you know uh Selectmen tend
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
to meet uh weekly or bi-weekly and I'm
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
around any other questions from the
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
committee representative sers thank you
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
question uh you said it's newon you're
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
representing right and Newbery and
 
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.030 align:start position:0%
representing right and Newbery and
Newbury

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
Newbury
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is is around the
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
data how many accidents do you have
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
around the Lakes area do you have that
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
data you can give to us I don't have
 
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
actual data for you I mean I I'm sure it
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
could be obtained but you know it's
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
local data as as opposed to um something
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
that probably the state keeps track of I
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
mean we have someone here from the
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we have somebody
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
here from from do and I think anyone uh
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
could understand that it can be
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult uh during congested
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
Seasons to maintain uh you know the safe
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
roads I mean you know has somebody
 
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
actually been hit and killed or
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
something I you know I can't tell you
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
exactly the
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
circumstances I know one time I was
 
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
doing 20 mil an hour or less and I came
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
around a corner in one of our lakes and
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
there was a very happy family with their
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
dog just strung out right across the
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
road and then another dog came leaping
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
out and um you know if I hadn't been
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
going the speed that I was going it
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
could have been a challenging situation
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
so I I really think this would be
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
helpful if the committee would consider
 
00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.790 align:start position:0%
helpful if the committee would consider
sporting

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
sporting
 
00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:39.559 align:start position:0%
it representative foot thank you Mr
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative I'm not
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
sure if you can answer this enough but
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
in the bill here it says the the
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
municipality will be um they would be
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
receiving the cost of the signage for
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
for the changes correct so there's no
 
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
cost to be born by the state my question
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
if you you know let's say somebody who
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
goes up seasonally to this to the lake
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
area and drives around and last time
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
they were up there it was 30 miles an
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
hour and they're not paying attention
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
just the foliage or whatnot and they
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
thinking 30 miles an hour would there be
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
any other additional signage requirement
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
to kind like a pre-s signage like hey
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
just you know the speed changes in X
 
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
miles around this facility or because
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
people can get caught up in that muscle
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
memory um you know I think we frequently
 
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
have situations where there are digital
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
signs that are put up on the side of the
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
road and um I know in my town if there's
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
a situation that arises even if it's
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
voting or if it's a winter storm or
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
whatever or you see it on the side of a
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
of a state highway there's notifications
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
of a Slowdown ahead and so I think um
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
you know they would put some sort of
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
signage up to indicate and I guess the
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
only other thing I would say is that you
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
know drivers also have responsibilities
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to the road and they're
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
frequently um speed changes on any road
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
that you go along and you have to be
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
alert so um as much as there's a
 
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility for signage I think
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's always a continuing
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the part of the driver
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
to be aware of their
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
surroundings any other questions
 
00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:26.829 align:start position:0%
surroundings any other questions
represent

00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for take
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
my question um since there is provision
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
in the law currently for uh seasonal
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
speed limit adjustments how does your
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill make it better um there is a
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
provision in state law that allows the
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
state upon petition to reduce the speed
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
limit to 20 miles an hour the problem is
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
there is no parallel Authority for towns
 
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing so the state in
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
this case has an authority that the
 
00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:06.799 align:start position:0%
towns do not and they don't have the
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
authority on their own
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
roads oh that's how it makes it better
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
to answer your question go ahead follow
 
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
up um as a followup uh are there any
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
particular roads that uh might not be
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
available uh certain highways like if a
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
numbered Highway way goes through your
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
town or something like that is that well
 
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.470 align:start position:0%
town or something like that is that well
this

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this would only apply to town
 
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
roads so if there was um someone that or
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
if a municipality wanted to request the
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
state to reduce the speed limit on a
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
state road they could do that um and
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
then it would be up to the state on
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
whether or not they wanted to do it I
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
mean frankly the situation we've got
 
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
right now and I have it in my town I
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
have a state state road that goes around
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
one part of the lake and I have a Town
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
Road that is on the other part of the
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
lake and the state could reduce the
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
speed limit to 20 miles an hour for the
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
same four-month period I mean this
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
language is virtually identical to what
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
to the state statute that allows states
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
to do this anyway the state could uh
 
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
reduce the speed limit to 20 miles an
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
hour but the town couldn't and
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
so I mean for me just from a standpoint
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
of of local control um you know these
 
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
people the towns pay for the roads they
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
use the roads the most they Patrol the
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
roads they're directly responsibility
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for the safety of the roads
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
and they currently don't have this tool
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
to reduce the speed limit to try to keep
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
the road safe in their town
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
and I was grow I grew up in Austin I'm a
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire native I'm like if the
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
state can do this I just really think
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
too uh any other questions from the
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
committee uh I've got one I'll say for
 
00:53:11.309 --> 00:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation but the
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
other one I have for you uh if 10
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
residents of a
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
municipality um sign a petition is there
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
and a reading through it now is there
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
any guarantee or of how the hearing
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
process uh May work in the town uh
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
because perhaps 10 people want it
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
lowered but maybe the rest of the Town
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't um well you know in in my town
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
um we have Selectmen and the Selectmen
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
would consider it at a public meeting at
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
a public hearing and notice goes into
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
the newspaper and all the other ways in
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh in which public hearings are noticed
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
and you know people would have the
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and speak their
 
00:53:54.359 --> 00:53:56.030 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and speak their
minds

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
minds
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
I one thing I would say Mr chair is that
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
I wanted to at least have 10 people um
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
sign the petition because I didn't feel
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
that one or two people I just didn't
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
feel that was enough I mean I felt like
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
you should have some sort of consensus
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
among a certain number of people um to
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
bring this forward to ensure that it's a
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's a situation worthy of
 
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you
 
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.069 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you
seeing

00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
no further questions representative foot
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair F thank you
 
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative um so in this bill is it
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
limited to a certain number of streets
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
per Community or can they just to a
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
blanket the whole Community as a whole
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
so because of seasonal um increase where
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
summer winter
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
whatnot or is it limited to an isolated
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
area it says well what this says on any
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
part part of a highway SE system that is
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
seasonally congested so the the um I
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
mean as I understand it the way the
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
state works I mean they look at a
 
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
particular part of the road and but you
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
know if the if the town of Tuftonboro
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to reduce it seasonally to to um
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
to 20 miles an hour I suppose they could
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
I don't I just don't think that that
 
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.589 align:start position:0%
I don't I just don't think that that
would

00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
happen seeing no further questions thank
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
much uh next up chair recognizes

water town of Madison borders uh another
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
Lake being Silver Lake and I have many
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
of these locations as you drive around
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
my district where um 40 years ago uh
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
when beaches were established by towns
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
and there wasn't a lot of room for a
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
beach then they just cleared places to
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
the side of the rideway to
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
park and the people that live in those
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
areas also many times have homes that
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
are across the street and they their
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
access to their boat and so forth is
 
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
across the street in particular I have a
 
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
a road Plains Road uh that runs from um
 
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
Tamworth into Madison it's a state
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
shared Road uh residents for years have
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
been trying to find some way of relief
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
seasonally to slow down that traffic as
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
it passes by um I have um I have a state
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
highway that runs through the town of
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
Tamworth um through a village in South
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
Tamworth that was always at 35 miles an
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
hour and then one day a person from the
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
Department decided that that didn't make
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
sense and started the proc process and
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
increase the speed to 45 M an hour had
 
00:57:34.109 --> 00:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
notified the U the town official the
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
police department and no one had
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
responded and the speed limit moved up
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
to that the people in that short Village
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
District as you all know when you drive
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
there's usually a 10 m hour uh variance
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
on when we're going to stop uh traffic
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
from moving through and they were
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
totally alarmed Med over the process
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to take uh Community
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
involvement uh the Lakes Region Planning
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
Commission and probably a year or two
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
years to bring those people in do back
 
00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:08.119 align:start position:0%
to the table to see if we can have a
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
reduction in speed limit in the people
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
um in Madison on this Silver Lake
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
stretch of road I'm talking to they're
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
repeatedly asking how can we do this uh
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
the question on on uh signage that's out
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
there before and after uh that stretch
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
of road and many of these stretch of
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
roads routinely within 10 miles will
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
move up 10 10 miles per hour higher or
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
lower so forth so I I support this uh
 
00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:43.829 align:start position:0%
lower so forth so I I support this uh
this

00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%
proposal um I think it's something that
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
U is to the benefit of of my small towns
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
I don't have cities I have I have towns
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
populations of 2 to 5,000 th000 people
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
and I think this is something that that
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh will provide uh safety uh to my
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
little towns and let the Selectmen
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
decide if it's something they want to
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
move forward with or not move forward
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then it might also then give energy
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
on some of those State highways where I
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
have issues once this is put in uh that
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
might open up a conversation that'll be
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
easier to have with that I Happ to take
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
questions if there are sir thank you
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
very much any questions from the
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
committee let letting you off the hook
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
recognizes and this is from a
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
professional Noah
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
Gres representing the Hampshire
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association gra for the
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
municipal Association I apologize for my
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
handwriting and uh in support of the
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill looking for a couple of minutes yes
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
please um so the municipal Association
 
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
does support this bill um I understand
 
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
that the same idea has come before the
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
the committee several times before we
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
think this year it is very narrowly
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
targeted to address the specific problem
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
that we've heard from Members about um
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
we have as you've already heard today
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
numerous communities that have you know
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
either beaches across the street from
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
parking lots or for some reason or other
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh very congested local Road
 
01:00:27.549 --> 01:00:27.559 align:start position:0%
particularly around you know bodies of
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
water um around you know winter sports
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
areas uh things of that nature um and
 
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
they're only congested seasonally um
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard from local police
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
departments from local public works
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
departments that there are situations
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
that don't always result in accidents
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
but they are stationing police out there
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
more frequently because they want to you
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
know when somebody sees a police car
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
generally they slow down although uh
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
that's not always the case but they
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
usually slow down because they expect
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
something is happening um and keep a
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
little bit closer eye on the road um and
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
so municipalities have been trying to
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
mitigate this to some extent but it
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't enough um and so what they
 
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
would like to do is seasonally reduce
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
that speed limit because they think that
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
the that would assist them in avoiding
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
um incidents where there may be injuries
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
there may be property damage involved um
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
I live in the city of conquer I can
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
speak personally there are several
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
streets um that are seasonally congested
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately my car has been the
 
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
victim of uh a avoidance of a uh
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
accident with a person instead was my
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
car was the chosen Target um had
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
everyone been driving slower that would
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
have been avoided um but nevertheless um
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh it is a local option that we think is
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
really important really clearly targeted
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
towards um allowing me to I alties the
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
local level to use their local knowledge
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the the their Road system and apply
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
that in the manner that best suits their
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
their residents happy to take any
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee committee
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
may have thank you any questions from
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing then thank you
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
again uh representative
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chairman uh just a
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
quick question um and I maybe I should
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
have asked the sponsor but I know you're
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
you're up on this how do you define
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
seasonal like if if there's a onewe bike
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
week is that considered a season if
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
somebody has a pond hockey tournament
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
over a weekend is that a season or does
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
it have to be a summer
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
season so the or a winter season the
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
intent here is for really a I think a
 
01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:48.039 align:start position:0%
summer weekend not not a summer or
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
winter or fall something like that up to
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
a 4month period not not a week weekend
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
um a weekend event typically has uh you
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
know additional police presence they
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
often have detail work out there um to
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
control traffic um and that's a
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
temporary uh a temporary situation it's
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
a lot more difficult to manage traffic
 
01:03:13.269 --> 01:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
over a two three four month period as
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
people are visiting the lake um because
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
you simply can't stretch your Police
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
Department in that manner for that long
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
of a Time thank you Mr chairman forther
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
questions see
 
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.589 align:start position:0%
questions see
representative

01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
plon thank you just very quick my only
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
concern with this and I'm looking for
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
your opinion is uh say a rapid speed
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
drop it's going from say more than 10
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
miles an hour from a 30 to 20 I think is
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable but if you've got a 35 or
 
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
even possibly a 45 mph going to 20
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
should there be something legislatively
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
to pre-warn at a certain distance notice
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
you know 100 yard speed drops to 20 mil
 
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
an hour that's about my concern with
 
01:03:57.309 --> 01:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
this any recommendations there if that's
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment that the committee wants to
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
have I wouldn't have any objection to
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
that um we're just trying to make things
 
01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:04.839 align:start position:0%
safer certainly if there's you know
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
we've all seen on the side of the road
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
State Police ahead type thing um if
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's you if if the committee believes
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
that would that would benefit the
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
community and help uh reduce any uh any
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
incidents of harm to anyone or property
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something we would we
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
would support thank you thank you Mr
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
chair further
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you very
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
much thank you and representative plon
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
that that question probably best served
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Transportation who
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
is coming
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
up uh as a matter of fact coming up next
 
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
Sher recognizes Michael O'Donald from

Transportation not taking a position on
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
the bill from what I can
 
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
again all right thank you Mr chairman

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
do um I do have written testimony again
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
from uh commissioner Cass and uh we um
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
do take a position on this in support of
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
this bill um sorry I didn't mark that on
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
my on my card
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
um um
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
sure um so basically in the 15
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
legislative session a bill passed to
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
allow seasonal speed limits on state
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
highways that were seasonally congested
 
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
by pedestrian and bicycle traffic um
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
26562 um some communities uh have taken
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
advantage of this and uh we have
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
evaluated and allowed them to post
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
seasonal speed limit reductions uh most
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
of these are around lakes and um you
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
know as as was pointed out um some Lakes
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
have state maintained and owned uh class
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
two roadways along their Frontage and
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
others have class five locally
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
maintained roads along their Frontage
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
some have a combination of both so you
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
could be driving around the lake on a
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
Class 2 state road with a seasonal speed
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
limit and then you turn a corner to
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
continue your journey around the lake
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
and you're now on a class five locally
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
maintained Road and as the law is
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
written now they do not have the
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
authority to post a seasonal speed speed
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
limit on their Road um so this bill
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
would would offer that level of
 
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
consistency um in the area uh oftentimes
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
motorists don't know whose jurisdiction
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're in whether they're on a state
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
road or a local Road especially a
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
non-numbered state road and we we do
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
have many of those um so we would uh
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
support this bill to give the
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities the authority to
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
seasonally reduce speed limits on their
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
roads uh just as the state has the
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
authority to do it on our roads thank
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much I'm going to
 
01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
lead off with a couple of quick
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
questions um the speed limits on the
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
municipally posted class five roads as
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
you say
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
um are those speed limits because I'm
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
looking at lines 13 14 that even with a
 
01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
petition the engineering and traffic
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
investigation will take place so speed
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
limits that are currently there are
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
those engineered and and trafficly
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
investigated if you
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
will I I find often times
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
not um that's fine I just didn't want to
 
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
see looking at it at the beginning you
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
would think that there would be no no
 
01:07:55.269 --> 01:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
difference uh in the recommendation if
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
they were both investigated so fair
 
01:07:58.829 --> 01:07:58.839 align:start position:0%
enough any other questions from the
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
committee representative V thank you Mr
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
question um how effective are these I
 
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
mean I think the motivation is to reduce
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
police patrols but how effective is just
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
dropping the speed limit without some
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
other form of friction like a police
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
patrol or barriers or something like
 
01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question um we've found
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
that there's no practical difference in
 
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
operating speeds resulting from the
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
seasonal speed limits
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
um you know we can detect in the data
 
01:08:26.759 --> 01:08:27.870 align:start position:0%
um you know we can detect in the data
slight

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
slight
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
reductions um I think the the largest
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
benefit has been to the municipalities
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
citizens feeling like they can do
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
something about speed uh and I have
 
01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
heard very positive things from the
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
towns and individual
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
citizens on that matter thanks thank you
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
did I see representative SES thank you
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr odonnell um I
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify a point that was
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
raised earlier my understanding is that
 
01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
raised earlier my understanding is that
this

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill would allow speed limits to go down
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
to 20 but does not necessarily require
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
that they go down to 20 if it's a 35 M
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
hour speed limit the town may wish to do
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
only 30 or
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
25 is that am I reading this correctly
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
yes I believe you are um we've done that
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
on the state system where um you know
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
for example the town requested a 10 m
 
01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
hour reduction on the state road and the
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
state found five miles an hour to be
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
more appropriate thank
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
Landon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
Mr Odon again to repeat a question I
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
asked earlier um would you how do you
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
feel about an area where the road is uh
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
the speed reduction would say is more
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
than 10 miles an hour should there be a
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
prior notice um say you know 100 yards
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
in advance that you know speed limits
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
going from 45 to 20 that's one question
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
what's your opinion on that sir um thank
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh my my opinion is
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not issued an opinion I follow the
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
mutcd which does require that type of
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
signage that you mentioned perfect thank
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
you if I may continue next question
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
follow up um next question is um many uh
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh towns uh when entering the town there
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
they they post uh basically the state
 
01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
law speed limit throughout the town if
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
unposted 30 miles an hour do you foresee
 
01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
this as an opportunity for a town when
 
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
they're having a seasonal event for a
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
month or two just post for the entire
 
01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
town speed limit reduced to 20 miles an
 
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
hour during the month of August is that
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
is that feasible I I do not see that as
 
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
a possibility um because this this
 
01:10:59.310 --> 01:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
references the seasonal um congestion by
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
pedestrians and
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
bicyclists so we're thinking you know
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
maybe uh May 15 to September 15th or
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day to Labor Day that's what
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at at the state as a
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
season uh you know could be the fall if
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know foliage season Etc
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank you a final comment we're going to
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
move on um you know what quickly okay
 
01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
one more yeah real quick so in other
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
words what you're saying is that these
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
streets should the the board their
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
selected board uh vote on this they
 
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
would be each individually
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
posted yes that that would be the intent
 
01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.310 align:start position:0%
posted yes that that would be the intent
thank

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
you uh anybody else from the committee I
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
have one more if you don't mind
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
um nothing personal the but these bills
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
and I've seen many of these efforts for
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
20 miles an hour over the years and and
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
the words of uh Mr Lambert I think you
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
who you replaced many years ago before
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
this committee when he said 20 miles an
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
hour is painfully
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
slow and so I don't have a problem with
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
with u with uh reduced speed limits when
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's needed but the problem with these
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
bills is that that's only when the
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
people are present even though as I
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
heard earlier it's the pedestrians that
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
aren't paying attention that's actually
 
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.070 align:start position:0%
aren't paying attention that's actually
spawning

01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
spawning
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
this have you seen or is any other
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism in statute that would allow
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
for speed limit change to be for certain
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
hours of the day and the reason I ask is
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
because if there's no people or are no
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
people present we are still going to be
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
stuck with the 20 M hour painfully
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
slow I I don't know that I have a
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
complete answer on that although I do
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
feel like the
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
mutcd has Night speed limits they have
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
uh black signs for for night uh we don't
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
haven't done that in New Hampshire uh to
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
my knowledge um and i' I've looked a lot
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
of speed limits I worked closely with
 
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
with Bill Lambert for a number of years
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
um and still still uh talked to him
 
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
quite a bit in his position as safety
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
administrator thank you very much
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no other questions
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh that's last person I
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%

sources section uh Dees does not take a
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but wanted to make
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
the committee aware of some uh
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that are apply to the state
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
of New
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh from the Federal
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency so Motor
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
Vehicles are our primary source of air
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
pollution in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
and while New Hampshire is in attainment
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
with all of our federal air quality
 
01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
standards at the moment we were not um
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
as little as you know eight years ago I
 
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.550 align:start position:0%
as little as you know eight years ago I
believe

01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh trying to remember exactly when we
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
implemented the requirement for onboard
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
diagnostics testings of Motor Vehicles
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
but it was it was um quite some time ago
 
01:18:09.629 --> 01:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
we've gone through several rural
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
revisions with Department of Safety to
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
streamline the program and make sure
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
that uh that it is um as sort of
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
non-intrusive as possible our latest
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
change to the to the state rules were
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
submitted to EPA
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
about 24 months ago and I think just
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
last month or the beginning of this
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
month we finally received Federal
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
approval of those of those new rules so
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
we can Now operate by the new rules um
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
so the point here being that we can
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
change the rules uh but it takes time
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
and it cannot be done in 60 days to
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
number one revise the state rules but
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
but more importantly to have Federal
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
approval by the um Environmental prot
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency absent that Federal
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
approval should EPA be so inclined they
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
could theoretically come in and enforce
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
our previous rules on the state of New
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or uh you know simply find the
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
state to be in non-compliance with our
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
state implementation plan which could
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
risk Federal
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
funding so again you know Dees um is is
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
open to discussing changes to the rules
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
but the 60-day time period on this um is
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
going to be uh way too short for us to
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
do this in in a way that would be
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
acceptable by our governor governing
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
Federal agency um the other point that I
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to make is that Federal rules
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
have changed since our our program was
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
designed and again we just recently got
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
a sort of a reauthorization under our
 
01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.669 align:start position:0%
a sort of a reauthorization under our
revised

01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
revised
 
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
rules but recently the federal
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
government has adopted additional rul
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
making that requires uh
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
new sort of states that are newly coming
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
into non attainment and having to
 
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
implement onboard diagnostics testing or
 
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
other vehicle emission programs to also
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
include onroad testing of vehicles so
 
01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:17.719 align:start position:0%
whether that uh is um you know driveby
 
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
testing because there are sort of laser
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
gun type things that can that can take
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
um measur of tailpipe emissions or
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's pulling random cars over on
 
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
the side of the road and and requiring
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
roadside testing of these to make sure
 
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
they're in
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
compliance uh that is a a current
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
requirement of the federal rules if we
 
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
had to revise our state rules right now
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
it is entirely possible that EPA would
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
require New Hampshire to implement that
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
portion of the federal program as
 
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
well I'm happy to take any
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much any
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
I actually have one uh you mentioned the
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
60 days if I understand you
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
correctly your concern is not moving the
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
moving the actual the waiver from 60 to
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
90 days your concern is more of 60 days
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes it gets instituted
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
within 60 days that I hear you
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
correcting the concern um so the the
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
change the 60 days to 90 days we
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
currently have Federal approval for that
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
60-day because the the rules that
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
implement this um the department of
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
safety rules that implement this program
 
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
are part of our federally approved State
 
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
imp implementation plan so anytime they
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
update their rules we have to go through
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
this entire process to get um the final
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
okay from Environmental Protection
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
Agency so they would need the time to
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
change their rules and we would need the
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
time to then uh subsequently submit
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
those rules to EPA for approval and
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
incorporation into our state
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
implementation plan so so that's the
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
part of it but also because because the
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
federal requirements have become more
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
stringent um EPA could also uh reject
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
our proposed amendment and and say you
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
need to you know if you're going to
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
change your existing authorization you
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
need to come all the way up to full
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with the federal rules which
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
again now would require some level of of
 
01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:28.790 align:start position:0%
again now would require some level of of
onroad

01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
testing representative Coker thank you
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
question do do you know approximately
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
how much money is like I guess like like
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
Federal funding would be at stake if we
 
01:22:43.149 --> 01:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
fall out of
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
compliance I I can't give you a dollar
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
amount um I will say that almost the
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
entirety of the Department of
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is is
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
funded or quite a bit of it is funded
 
01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
through the Environmental Protection
 
01:22:56.679 --> 01:22:57.870 align:start position:0%
through the Environmental Protection
Agency

01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
Agency
 
01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.910 align:start position:0%
Agency
funding

01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
um uh some do programs could be at risk
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to think if Department of
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
Safety could be at risk as well um okay
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
I I I really can't answer that do you
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
know like anybody that might know how
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
just how much total funding could be on
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
the line like we can certainly take the
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
question back and and see if we can get
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
an answer awesome thank you
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
yep any other questions from the
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
you well I have no other further cards
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
on on this bill so I guess that will
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:24:00.709 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
um chair I like to recognize uh Steve
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
Zac who uh supports the bill um my name
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
is Steve zanic I'm from Manchester uh I
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
do support the bill uh and one of the
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I support the bill is sometimes
 
01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:19.719 align:start position:0%
uh basically the whole emissions program
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
is based on uh computer checks
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
internally to the car there's no
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
tailpipe emissions checks anymore so
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
your car could probably be running
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
completely fine not polluting but you
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
know One sensor is acting up you know
 
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
and it could be an intermittent issue
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a broken wire somewhere
 
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
and it's just really hard to
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
diagnose um it could I've seen people
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
spend thousands trying to get the check
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
wallet light to turn off on their car um
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
and uh even if the even if the solution
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
to the check engine light is is very
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
obvious and can be fixed immediately um
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
even once you you know replace the
 
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
sensor or fix the wire or whatever is
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
wrong with it um and you reset the code
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
you still have to drive several drive
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
cycles um to make the uh car OBD ready
 
01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
um and uh depending on your driving
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
conditions and stuff it could take weeks
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
for it to go to um uh to OBD ready mode
 
01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes and sometimes if it's like an
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
intermittent issue you might think it's
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
fixed and it's not um so I do support
 
01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
giving people more time to try to
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
troubleshoot and fix the issue uh the
 
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
other thing I would really recommend and
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
like to see is um if there is a
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
um if there was an alternative to the
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
OBD check for testing emissions where if
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
you think you're your car is fine but
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a check engine LI or it's
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
not going in OBD Readiness mode or
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
whatever the issue may be that maybe you
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
can bring your car somewhere else that
 
01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
has an old school tailpipe sniffer that
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
actually checks the emissions of the
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle rather than just relying solely
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
on the OBD um there was an article in
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
the Boston Globe over the summer about a
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
guy from Massachusetts who bought a uh
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
Chevy brand new Chevy from a dealership
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
in nashaa um and the check engine light
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
came on and General Motors still well at
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
least as of the time of the article in
 
01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
the summer never had a fix for him and
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
it was going on months and months and uh
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
he couldn't get his Massachusetts
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker because of this check
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
engine light and maybe if there was some
 
01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
kind of alternative program for him to
 
01:26:47.229 --> 01:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
get an actual tailpipe sniff or whatever
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh they could
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
have at least gotten him as sticker so
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
he can continue to drive the the car and
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know maybe for in his case there
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
might have been some lemon law or
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
something to to to go fall back on but
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
that could take months to go through
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
court or whatever it would have to go
 
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
through so um I do think that you know
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes things aren't cut and dry and
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
they're not and problems aren't
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
obviously quickly
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
fixed thank you any questions from the
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.790 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
question

01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
um in your experience how how often is
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
is the car operating um to parameters
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
but yet the light is on
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know how often that happens
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
but I've seen it happen uh I like I'm
 
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
not a professional mechanic but you know
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
I I work on my my own cars my family's
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
cars uh friends Cars uh you know and
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know I've seen people
 
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.870 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know I've seen people
spend

01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know th sometimes thousands of
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
dollars chasing an issue um and it's you
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
know and sometimes it's so weird and
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
intermittent that causes the issue so uh
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
now they don't do tailpipe sniffing
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
anymore so I mean technically
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
something's wrong if the check engine
 
01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
lights um on but that doesn't
 
01:28:18.990 --> 01:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
polluting any other questions from the
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
you okay with that I don't have any
 
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
cards so I'm going to close the hearing
 
01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.430 align:start position:0%
cards so I'm going to close the hearing
on

01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
1403 our next bill will be HP 1637 in
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:20.270 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.920 --> 01:30:20.830 align:start position:0%
 
session

01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.840 --> 01:31:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
y

01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:32:27.430 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay it be at 11 o'clock I'm going to
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing on HP
 
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
1637 relative to reducing requirements
 
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
for vehicle inspection the prime sponsor
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
is not here so representative Coker will
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
be introducing the
 
01:32:49.109 --> 01:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman um so HB 1637
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
is a um act to reduce requirements for
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections I'm kind of doing a
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh a I guess courtesy introduction on it
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh one aspect of the bill I like is it
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
looks like it decouples
 
01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:04.030 align:start position:0%
looks like it decouples
the

01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
um basically instead of having the
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
sticker be tied to your birth month it's
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
tied to when it was inspected so that's
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
the aspect of the bill that I like but
 
01:33:15.149 --> 01:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
other than that uh I'll take any
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
questions but probably not
 
01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
questions but probably not
really

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
Coker do do we have other other pin
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
cards for this Bill yes okay
 
01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
thanks chair like to recognize Rebecca
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
oler and
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
Jessica wer
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
WLX from the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
vental Services do not say you support
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
or oh there's the prime I'll give hello
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
hello again Rebecca erer Jessica Wilcox
 
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
um this is is pretty much the same
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
points as the previous bill in that this
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
would change um the RSA that uh that has
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
been adopted under our federally
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
approved State implementation plan
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
therefore we would have to submit and
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
get EPA get Federal approval of a new
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
state implementation plan in addition
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
this would um because it would reduce
 
01:34:19.709 --> 01:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
five years worths of vehicles um and the
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
oldest would and typically the most the
 
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
highest polluting Vehicles because
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
things do degrade after time we would be
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
the state of new hire would be required
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
to implement measures that would make up
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
for those additional emissions that
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
would come from the Transportation
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
sector by implementing um uh rules on
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
some other portion of our of our SE of
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
our economy most likely the business
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
sector because when U businesses are the
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
second largest source of air pollution
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so this would be
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
transferring transferring the emission
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
reduction responsibility from vehicle
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
essentially thank you any questions from
 
01:35:04.159 --> 01:35:08.390 align:start position:0%
essentially thank you any questions from
the

01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee well representative sers so
 
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
you're concerned with uh thank you Mr
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
chair so you're concerned with the
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
emissions part right correct okay and is
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
it a is it a u a lot of work
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
to get the approvals or changes that you
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
saying has to be made it is we would
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
have to revise our our the re the
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
statute would be revision revised um
 
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
following that Dees would have to revise
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules and then we
 
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
would need to submit both the revised
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
Statute and our revised rules to the
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency for
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
their approval so that we were not in
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
violation of federal Clean Air Act
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
requirements and again that process
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
takes anywhere from 16 to 24
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
months follow up yeah yeah thank you so
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
I mean part of this that I'm reading
 
01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
here it's like the the vehicle already
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
has a sticker and they're just saying
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
allow the stick what I was reading is
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
allow the sticker to run out to one year
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't seem like it would be in
 
01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
violation there was a part of this where
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
is it okay um at the on the page
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
six uh Rond three it says no rule should
 
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
require onboard diagnostic system
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
inspection on vehicles over 15 model
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
years old and we currently inspect
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
Vehicles 20 model years old and
 
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
newer so we would have to and that's
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
both in our state statute and in our
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
rules so both would have to be revised
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
approval representative Jones is that
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
hand up yes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
um the last bill that you spoke to you
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
talked about the risk of uh losing
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
Federal funding is is that risk also
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
with this Bill yes it is thank
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%

is Leah kushman I represent the town of
 
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
we um I I brought this bill because I've
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
come to understand
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
politics is the art of the possible and
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
in a house that is nearly split down the
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
middle um in an issue that clearly a
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
full repeal of inspections or um you
 
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
know sweeping changes on the vehicle
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
inspections are not supported by the
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
House of
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
Representatives um and likely not the
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
Senate either so but people are having
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
hardship because of the inspections and
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
I know that you've all heard many times
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
the arguments for why why we should have
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
them why we shouldn't and I won't take
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
your time up there because I'm sure
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard it over and over again um
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
but people are really struggling um so
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
my husband is a mechanic I am a lay
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
person I only know
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
automotives because of what I have to
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
pay for and what my husband has to fix
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
and how long it takes and the fact that
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
I've gotten tickets for not having my
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
car inspected because he either wasn't
 
01:38:54.990 --> 01:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
able to get the thing fixed in time or
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
we were saving up the money to replace a
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
part um you know and and it's just I'm
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
not the only one but I'm here for those
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
people who are really struggling this
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
economy is not great um so we just went
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
through the administrative rules my
 
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
husband and I um and kind of looked at
 
01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
what things are not priority for
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
safety but also can cause some red ape
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
that ends up causing hardship for the
 
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
people um so go so we we literally just
 
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
went line by line and talked about you
 
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
know the different things and why is
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
this in place is it necessary for safety
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
maybe not in my husband's opinion um
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
he's working so he couldn't be here to
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
to help me um but it's technical most
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
most of it is pretty
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
straightforward you know for um it would
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
help if an inspection sticker could stay
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
with the vehicle from transfer of
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
ownership um I heard that there were
 
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
some challenges with that um you know
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
whatever can be preserved in this
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
bill that's possible to be preserved and
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
passed is better than what we have now
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
so if there's amendments that need to be
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
made um that's okay if if we see places
 
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
where we can open it up a little more
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
that's great um if you see things that
 
01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
are just not workable that's
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
understandable I just want things to be
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
a little easier for the people and I
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
also put in um something in there to
 
01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:31.639 align:start position:0%
make it easier for the inspection
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
stations also because they I spoke with
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
some mechanics my husband doesn't have a
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
shop by the way um he had one in
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts he's no longer a
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
practicing mechanic he has a new career
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
but that's what he did so he has all
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
that knowledge uh but so making it so
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
that the length of time that that an
 
01:40:54.669 --> 01:40:54.679 align:start position:0%
inspection takes is not a trigger for
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
some kind of audit or uh penalty uh
 
01:40:58.159 --> 01:40:59.510 align:start position:0%
some kind of audit or uh penalty uh
that's

01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
in you already talked about the
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
ownership transfer at the first part of
 
01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:04.070 align:start position:0%
ownership transfer at the first part of
the

01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
bill um the inspections station
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
one is at the be is on uh page four line
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
16 so it looks like a lot of text but
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's really just because we're adding
 
01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:19.159 align:start position:0%
something at the end of that long
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
section of statue
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
um only the things at the very end of
 
01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that are not in bold which I'll
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
go to are are not um bolded for you to
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
see where the new language is so
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
everything that's bolded is new
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
everything that's struck out is is a
 
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
change um up to page four that's where
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
that that other one with the um for the
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
stations is to give them a little help
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
um section three of the bill it starts
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
on line 24 page
 
01:41:51.719 --> 01:41:53.709 align:start position:0%
on line 24 page
for

01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
um I got rejected for an inspection
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
personally because my wheel well had a
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
little bit of rust on the edge of
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
it and I was told that it's a hazard for
 
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
someone walking by and that that's why
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
so we talked about it and said if it
 
01:42:14.669 --> 01:42:14.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't protrude more than a half an
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
inch maybe that you know it should be
 
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
okay to go people shouldn't be touching
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
your car really anyway
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so that was our thinking there that
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
might might end up making it
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
um that might end up making it so that
 
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
that surface rust you know that isn't
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
structural that people don't have to go
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
and spend thousands of dollars to get
 
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:38.870 align:start position:0%
and spend thousands of dollars to get
that

01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
fixed um then the light issue
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
so section
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
four on the back of page five you'll see
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
um it eliminates rust
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
as a factor on the light for for failing
 
01:42:58.109 --> 01:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
it as long as rust or any other
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
imperfections exist on it but they don't
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
inhibit the ability of the light to do
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
its job and project um
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
effectively in my opinion should not
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
result in a failure um so I I added
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
there that um linear cracks in a head
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
lamp or reflecting surface shall not
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
cause inspection failure this is
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
actually about reflectors but it it car
 
01:43:23.070 --> 01:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
cares over to the lights too in the next
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
section um you'll see number five no
 
01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.070 align:start position:0%
section um you'll see number five no
directional

01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
directional
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
um no directional signal shall cause
 
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
inspection failure unless it doesn't
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
function properly is not properly
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
directed is obscured or has a minimum
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
light output and projection lower than
 
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
the vehicle's original equipment again
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
this this is to um address an
 
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
administrative rule that spoke to this
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
issue and I can get you each rule that
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
goes with each change I'll send an email
 
01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
to the committee if you want that
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
reference that cross
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
reference um then you see
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
reflectors window function so these new
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
sections from line 30 on page five and
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
down um they're not bolded but that's
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
new um and the reason for these I can
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
explain each one we'll just go through
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
window function uh if someone's window
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't go up or down I don't think that
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
should result in them having to fail an
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
inspection um I don't think it really
 
01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
has much to do with safety if you crash
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
into water you're going to break your
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
window if you're trying to get out of
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
your car you're going to use your door
 
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
or break your window if your door's not
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
working um and and if your door doesn't
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
work it just seems that it's overly
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
burdensome and that the
 
01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:45.639 align:start position:0%
the um you know the the safety benefit
 
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
that we're going to get from it is
 
01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
minimal um same with the exhaust pipe
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
inspection so my muffler fell off of my
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
car um going down my driveway and when
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
it came off it got punched a hole right
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
in it my husband got it and put it back
 
01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
on but he had to weld the hole and I
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
think that's technically a patch and I
 
01:45:10.350 --> 01:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
don't know like how many time like how
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
many people you know who have said oh I
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
have a hole in my muffler I have to get
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
it fixed you know and you hear that
 
01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
sound you know that you've got a hole in
 
01:45:17.599 --> 01:45:18.229 align:start position:0%
sound you know that you've got a hole in
your

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
muffler what do we have to replace our
 
01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
Muffler every time we get a hole based
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
on this rule that's kind of what it says
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
and buying a new muffler versus having
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
the tech just weld a patch or you know
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
close a hole seems common
 
01:45:35.199 --> 01:45:37.550 align:start position:0%
close a hole seems common
sense

01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:45:40.510 --> 01:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
um and then just the restrictions on
 
01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
rule making because a lot of these
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
things were in the rules and not in the
 
01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
statute so that's why they addressed
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
that so that's on the last page um just
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
again with so door handles latches and
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
locks and hinges if any of them
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
um are broken I believe is what it says
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
in the administrative
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
rules uh that it would fail even
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
if uh the door
 
01:46:08.589 --> 01:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
functions so say someone has you know
 
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
just like um a broken handle but they
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
can still open the door but maybe they
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
had to put you know tape over it these
 
01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:19.719 align:start position:0%
are common things in lowincome sectors
 
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
of society especially with used cars
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
this Committee just gave a break to
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
people who can afford brand new
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
cars um to avoid inspections for the
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
first year um and and it's really people
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
who are struggling financially who are
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
mostly impacted by this law um by these
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
requirements then yes the last uh the
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
well I'll get to that one after but the
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
number two Roman two no rule shall
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
require wooden bumpers to be made of
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
hardwood that seems really arbitrary you
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
can have a bumper support made of metal
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
which is usually what it comes stock or
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
you can have a piece of wood with a
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
quarter inch piece of Steel in front of
 
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
it um but it says in the statute that
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
that wood has to be hardwood and I I
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
looked and I couldn't find any research
 
01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
to say that hardwood is more resistive
 
01:47:15.550 --> 01:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
or safe in a
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
crash than softwood so um I don't know
 
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
if the department has comments on that
 
01:47:24.669 --> 01:47:24.679 align:start position:0%
but it seemed arbitrary to
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
me um and then number three no rues
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
should require onboard diagnostic system
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
inspection in vehicles over 15 model
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
years old we know that the OBD is not a
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
safety thing so that's why it's here of
 
01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
course um I understand that there's no
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
will to eliminate it totally uh but a
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of folks who are in
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
financial hardship have those vehicles
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
that are older than 15 years old and the
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
OBD is the most common reason that
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
people can't get their vehicle fixed and
 
01:47:57.149 --> 01:47:57.159 align:start position:0%
have to get a new car um that I've I
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
I've experienced that's an
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
anecdote um you know you have a code and
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
no one can figure out where the code is
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
coming from but it's just you know it's
 
01:48:07.589 --> 01:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
just something in the exhaust system
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
it's you know it doesn't it doesn't
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
affect how your car is running it
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the vehicle safety but
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's this you know um rabbit hole that
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
the mechanic has to go down to diagnose
 
01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
and it can end up costing hundreds and
 
01:48:21.790 --> 01:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds of
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
dollars uh and then again that no rule
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
shall require inspection failure for a
 
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
functional headlamp lens or reflector
 
01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
having linear cracks as long as it
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
functions if it's cracked in just a
 
01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:37.639 align:start position:0%
linear meaning a line then it should be
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay and that's all and I I'll take any
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%

Hampshire auto deals Association and

Lieutenant James Larry from the state
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
police and Jeremy
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
Olen representative
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
Sykes thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
just I just was curious I wanted to make
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
sure that this was not an unintended
 
01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:26.679 align:start position:0%
consequence of your changes on page two
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
three um you take away an exceptions for
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
certain types of motorized vehicles you
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
take away ohrv snowmobiles mopeds and
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
rotable aircraft from being required to
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
have an inspection sticker I'm worried
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
that taking that out means that they
 
01:49:57.629 --> 01:49:57.639 align:start position:0%
would I don't know if there's some other
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
RSA that would require them would also
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
exempt them but I don't want to suddenly
 
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
require those vehicles to have an
 
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker if they do not
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
currently if they're not currently
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
required to do so do you you have a
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
thought about that thank you for the
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
question uh from what I'm reading they
 
01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
they need to have a an inspection
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.589 --> 01:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
dealer yeah they have to have an
 
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker anyway it says they
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
shall be inspected not later than 10
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
days after the registration or transfer
 
01:50:41.709 --> 01:50:41.719 align:start position:0%
of ownership so that's
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
just oh I'm sorry um that's line two
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's halfway through after the comma I'm
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
yeah after the comma shall be so all of
 
01:50:52.510 --> 01:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
those that are listed not
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
withstanding notwithstanding those other
 
01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
vehicles transferred to a licensed
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
dealer the ohrv snowmobiles mopeds
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
rotable aircraft and vehicles other than
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
Vehicles transferred to a licensed
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
dealer oh they kind of said that
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
twice anyway they shall not be inspected
 
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
later than 10 days after the
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
registration or transfer of ownership of
 
01:51:20.589 --> 01:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
said vehicle but if you see some
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
problems in the language there that need
 
01:51:24.589 --> 01:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
to be worked out I mean I would have no
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
objections if there's some unintended I
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeking to change what is
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
required to be inspected and what's not
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for
 
01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm glad you brought
 
01:51:41.229 --> 01:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
this up because I really believe the the
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
poor people are getting hammered I mean
 
01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
really really bad and anything that we
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
can change the rules and make things
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
more clear is is
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
awesome and is for
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
yourself I guess how often has your
 
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
husband are you seeing how many people
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
that come in I mean they're super
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
struggling and just don't have the money
 
01:52:06.270 --> 01:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
to repair this
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
stuff thank you for the question
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
um as far as super struggling I mean a
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
lot of the cars in Manchester if you
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
look around are not inspected or have um
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
old inspection stickers on them so I
 
01:52:24.189 --> 01:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
know that in the cities it's much more
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
prevalent and I think it's not as
 
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
enforced there because of that um but
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
out in the rural areas it's enforced
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
pretty heavily
 
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
um I mean anecdotally I talking to
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
people everyone I've talked to has said
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
that this is a burdensome thing it's
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's more burdensome and it's more
 
01:52:44.069 --> 01:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
difficult and there's more requirements
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
to pass an inspection in New Hampshire
 
01:52:45.599 --> 01:52:46.750 align:start position:0%
to pass an inspection in New Hampshire
than

01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um and then I can speak to
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
we're not we're average income household
 
01:52:54.669 --> 01:52:54.679 align:start position:0%
70 $80,000 a year between my husband and
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
I and um you know we we've never had new
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
cars uh and people would say well if
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
you're tired of paying for all the
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
repairs go buy a new car I mean it's not
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
really fair you know to say to somebody
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
go put yourself into debt for 25 years
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
or or eight years or 12 years or however
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
long when you can barely afford just the
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
current repairs that go month to month
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
that you have to do so I I just think
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
that it it is affecting a lot of people
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have a number on it but uh
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly pretty much everybody
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
that I have spoken to besides um people
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
here in in the house who um are either
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
State Police or or um Dees has supported
 
01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
some kind of Reform on this because it's
 
01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:45.149 align:start position:0%
some kind of Reform on this because it's
too

01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
burdensome any other questions from the
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
you chair like to recognize Dan Bennett
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Auto Dealers
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
Association uh who opposes the bill
 
01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
minutes uh thank you Mr chairman members
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I'll be as brief as
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
possible Dan Bennett New Hampshire auto
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
dealers were a trade Association for the
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle industry in New Hampshire
 
01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
um we're here opposed to HB 1637 as I
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
indicated on our card um as you've heard
 
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
us say before the annual inspection
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
program works in New Hampshire um and
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's right for New Hampshire as it is
 
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
for all of our New England states and
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
neighbors um you know we do run an
 
01:54:41.069 --> 01:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
autocap program which is an automotive
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh consumer action panel that receives
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
complaints uh and we receive virtually
 
01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
no complaints um on the inspection
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
process ESP especially in this bill as
 
01:54:53.709 --> 01:54:53.719 align:start position:0%
it's related to time uh time for an
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
inspection uh I have sat through
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
thousands of inspections including
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
attending class from both state state
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
police and the community college system
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which teaches classes
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
on Automotive inspection um and there is
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely no reference to minimum or
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
maximum time um for inspections
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
conducted just um having sat through
 
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
them um the marriage of the inspection
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the registration system works really
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
well in New Hampshire um it works for
 
01:55:22.030 --> 01:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
the town clerks it works for the
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
stations um and so um to to move off
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
that Mark um which is I think pretty
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
universally accepted um seems
 
01:55:35.709 --> 01:55:35.719 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um it also wipes out when
 
01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
there is a problem with that type of
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
marriage of those two things we have a
 
01:55:41.709 --> 01:55:41.719 align:start position:0%
16-month inspection option we used to
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
call it the snowbird option right if you
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
were in Florida in January and that's
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
when your inspection was due you could
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
get it done four months early this bill
 
01:55:50.669 --> 01:55:50.679 align:start position:0%
actually wipes out the 16mon inspection
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
so we take away that um that U component
 
01:55:57.069 --> 01:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
of that that we've we've honored for the
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
folks who need that accommodation uh to
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
make things a little bit easier but I
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
think it's uh in one of the line line 10
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
it wipes it out
 
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
um a couple the other things that I um
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to mention bouncing around
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit from some of the things um
 
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
that I've heard um I mean there's a
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
safety requirement in there to have
 
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
doors that securely close in a vehicle
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh that seems like a common sense safety
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
requirement for us to have functioning
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
um functioning doors um that securely uh
 
01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
stay closed
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
um the bill modifies the inspections and
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
Emissions program um to vehicles that
 
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
are no more than than 15 years old um
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
you heard from the Department of
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and we mentioned
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
this last time around you have no idea
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
whether the EPA will actually even
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
approve this exemption this is a shoot
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
first aim second approach that doesn't
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
do the homework on the front end to know
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be even afforded that
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
exemption which has severe
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
implications if you do in fact go for
 
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
that exemption the EPA is is surely
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
going to want to make sure that we have
 
01:57:05.069 --> 01:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
those emission reductions so they're
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
going to get their pound of Flesh and
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
you got to figure out who it's going to
 
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
fall on because if we're going to give
 
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
older dirtier cars a free pass is it
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to be the truckers the
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers the power plants uh
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have to make up
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
those emissions reductions and actually
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
contrary to what we heard on the bill
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
that you all had a few weeks ago you
 
01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
said the reason that we were okay with
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
the emissions reductions was because
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
newer cars are cleaner and they don't
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
pollute well now on the back side of it
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks later we're giving a pass
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
to what you would say would be the older
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
dirtier cars so those two those two um
 
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
kind of concepts are at odds um there's
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
also the component that I'll mention um
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
about sales Cycles you know um
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the year there's different
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
sales cycles for vehicles uh President
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
Day right everybody has heard of that
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
one or the end of the year type sale um
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
currently the way the inspection program
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
works is it's pretty even Keel over 12
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
months what this will do to shops that
 
01:58:06.189 --> 01:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
do conduct inspections is create a
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
rather erratic flow during times of high
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
sales low sales Seasons um and and in
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
the inspection stations um workload will
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
will fluctuate pretty severely um and
 
01:58:20.669 --> 01:58:20.679 align:start position:0%
then um I heard the word hardship
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned a lot um I think if it um
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we can get some information from
 
01:58:29.950 --> 01:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
DMV the OBD2 emissions testing program
 
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
as this committee knows because you
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
helped write the law has a hardship
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
waiver exemption for people who cannot
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
afford to have emissions repairs done or
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
if there's some glitch in the system
 
01:58:44.189 --> 01:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
that the manufacturer just cannot work
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
around the emissions testing component
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
um those two things a hardship wave
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
can and are administered by and and
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
given to Citizens by the DMV um they may
 
01:58:59.790 --> 01:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
have some de on that um and then just
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
couple notes that I jotted as we go um I
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
also heard that Massachusetts versus New
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and that new inspections
 
01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
are much more difficult in New Hampshire
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm very familiar with with both
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
systems um and that's just not the case
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has a live videos Feed
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
inside every inspection station not
 
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
building Bay service Bay with a live
 
01:59:29.709 --> 01:59:29.719 align:start position:0%
feed that State Police monitors the
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
inspections being conducted and they can
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
halt it on the spot it is a very very
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
burdensome um intrusive approach to um
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
to conducting safety and Emissions
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
Inspection so um R2 um it's state set
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know our our program in New
 
01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is free market based you don't
 
01:59:51.069 --> 01:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
like the cost of it vote with your
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
wallet and go find another station that
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
offers a cheaper different type uh of
 
01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
inspection so um as mentioned I just get
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
back to um it's our opinion that the
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
inspection program and system in New
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um isn't broken um and um and
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
for that those reasons um we're opposed
 
02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:10.910 align:start position:0%
for that those reasons um we're opposed
to

02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
1637 um and um I I'll attempt to answer
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
any questions if I can thank you so much
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative Coker thank you Mr
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr re so um you
 
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know shoot first aim
 
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
second and the prime sponsor she said
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
that she's open to input and friendly
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendments is there anything in this
 
02:00:37.069 --> 02:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
bill that you look at and you go we can
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
do this because I know you say you don't
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
get a lot of complaints but like I get a
 
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
ton of complaints from all aspects from
 
02:00:46.589 --> 02:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
the new cars to the the old cars I mean
 
02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
people are pissed at this program so
 
02:00:52.990 --> 02:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
like I would love any kind of input you
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
have on any of these sections that we
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
might be able even one little thing you
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
know it's it's good for both of us it's
 
02:00:59.790 --> 02:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
good for the industry and it's good for
 
02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
people uh well so to answer the question
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
in reference to the emissions component
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the the the shoot first a
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
second I mean Dees the folks who write
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
the grants for approval just told you it
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
takes 16 to 24 months to even get a
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
decision to know if we would even be
 
02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to modify that so so I would
 
02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
think we might want to do our homework
 
02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
first that's one I guess suggestion and
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
then at times um I would say our
 
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
industry has um supported um changes to
 
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
the programs when there are a problem in
 
02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
the inspection program um we attack it
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
with a scalpel not a hatchet and
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
fine-tune those things like we did with
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh a session or two ago we did it um
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
for uh window tin we also did it for
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
surface rust we worked with Deputy
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
speaker Smith on a bill that would uh
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
tweak around the edes um and I believe
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
chairman Walsh as well to tackle um
 
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
surface rust issues that were not safety
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
related surface issues that could
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
potentially cause reasons for failure so
 
02:02:05.950 --> 02:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
we wiped that component out so yeah
 
02:02:08.910 --> 02:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
there are times when we do when we do
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
work to um uh you know on on on issues
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
to to improve the program to lessen some
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
of the burden uh what be my response
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
follow follow up um so so just to be
 
02:02:24.069 --> 02:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
clear you don't see anything I mean like
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
the emission stuff I mean it sounds like
 
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
she's willing to really work with you
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
you don't see anything in this bill that
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
might be worth putting
 
02:02:34.589 --> 02:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
through um well I guess you know if we
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
were to take the time and do some
 
02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
homework then maybe we could chat about
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
stuff you know I don't profess to be an
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
expert on the crashworthiness of
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
hardwood versus softw you know maybe
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's something that we could sit down
 
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
and explore it's something that I'm not
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with but you know just um the
 
02:02:56.589 --> 02:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
the bill is it as a whole the way that
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
it's written right now because we're not
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
talking about pieces we're talking about
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
the bill as a whole right now on paper
 
02:03:03.629 --> 02:03:03.639 align:start position:0%
as it stands we're opposed to it all
 
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
right thank you any other questions from
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
sers thank you Mr chair so how could we
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
amend this bill to make it easier for
 
02:03:17.550 --> 02:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
the people that are poor because I'm
 
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
with representative ER it's I'm getting
 
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
hammered left and right and I'm getting
 
02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
emails saying our inspection stickers
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
are crazy and they're unjust and they're
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
just not working and the people are just
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely mad so how can we fix this
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
and go forward to help those people
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
especially the especially the people
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
that for I'm thinking kids that are
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
going through college you know they're
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to get through college with
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
the car they got and it's it it we all
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
know it's not the best cow they're just
 
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get college and those that are
 
02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
just with family with two or three kids
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
they're they're just dying out there how
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
can you we need some suggestions from
 
02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
you that's what I'm asking you how can
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
you help us
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
out uh yeah I guess um
 
02:04:05.069 --> 02:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
so couple quick responses um I would
 
02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
hope that when you do get those
 
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
constituent calls you um refer them to
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
either our autocap program or the
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office or to State
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
Police because those are the ones that
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
handle and and help resolve those issues
 
02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
um and then you know as
 
02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
um I guess as as far as changes um if
 
02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
what this committee wants to do is is
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
take a hard look um at some of those
 
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
items we'd be welcome to have those
 
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
discussions um like we did on the last
 
02:04:37.629 --> 02:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
bill I would truly bring in uh the
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
experts the folks that do it every
 
02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
single day that are in the trenches the
 
02:04:44.189 --> 02:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
the technicians that that see the type
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
of vehicles that roll in um and then
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
lastly uh
 
02:04:51.629 --> 02:04:51.639 align:start position:0%
um you
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
know college kid families Rich poor we
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
should all be safe whether you're
 
02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
driving or whether it's the uh 3,000 lb
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
missile that's going 80 M an hour in the
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
opposite lane coming towards me on a
 
02:05:12.430 --> 02:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
believe representative say clear thank
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
you m Mr chair um and thank you you
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned the hardship application yes
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
sir so if if person applies for the
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
hardship do you do can you tell me the
 
02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
length of time that takes to get through
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
where it's either granted or denied and
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
if that stops the inspection right there
 
02:05:38.109 --> 02:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
how that works yeah uh so R St Clair I
 
02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
wish that I had could answer that for
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
you we don't administer the program it's
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
written in the rules and it's
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
administered by the DMV and uh I believe
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
they're signed off personally by the DMV
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
director um so I would say we can
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
certainly ask DMV to give us some
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
hardship info but they're the ones that
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
are holder of
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
thata I thought you might know that so
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr chair again yeah you
 
02:06:07.709 --> 02:06:07.719 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that 3,000 pound missile
 
02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
and I I don't disagree with you but some
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
things aren't uh like a rust hole in the
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
fender is not going to be a 3,000 pound
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
missile I'm just really asking you how
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
can we amend this bill right here give
 
02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:23.719 align:start position:0%
us some ideas what we can do to make it
 
02:06:26.109 --> 02:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
easier for the people out there that's
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
all I'm asking is there anything you can
 
02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
supply and help the representatives with
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
to help us fix this at least with
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
something give us something is there
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
anything you can help us
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
with as I mentioned we're always o open
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
to to doing the homework and having this
 
02:06:45.069 --> 02:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
discussion utilizing um you know like I
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
said the experts in the field who do it
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
every single day that see stuff in all
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
shapes and sizes um but on paper as this
 
02:06:54.669 --> 02:06:54.679 align:start position:0%
one stands right now I don't have
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
anything to offer for you without um
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
know any other questions from the
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
committee we still have like three other
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
speakers that want to talk about this
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you Mr
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
chairman chair I like to recognize
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
Jeremy Olsen um who supports the bill
 
02:07:16.549 --> 02:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
who's representing himself asking for
 
02:07:16.559 --> 02:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
who's representing himself asking for
three

02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:27.189 align:start position:0%
three
minutes

02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh good morning um members of the
 
02:07:30.109 --> 02:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
committee and thank you for allowing me
 
02:07:32.350 --> 02:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
to testify today so the first thing I
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
would like to say is I am 100% in
 
02:07:36.750 --> 02:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
support of this bill as it's written and
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
would like to see it passed but one
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
thing I would like to point out is that
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
as um the sponsor originally said a lot
 
02:07:45.549 --> 02:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
of the stuff it's responses to problems
 
02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
that we have right now sections 3
 
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
through 9 it's all the different
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
problems that people have found with
 
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
mechanics finding problems that
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be considered safety problems
 
02:07:55.629 --> 02:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
and what I'd like to offer is another
 
02:07:57.549 --> 02:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
idea sounds like people are open to the
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
idea of amending it representative
 
02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
salers for example and um what I'd like
 
02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:02.270 align:start position:0%
salers for example and um what I'd like
to

02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:04.990 --> 02:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
offer is that the state consider adding
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
something to the to the rules that allow
 
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
like an actual due process system right
 
02:08:11.310 --> 02:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
now when people have these problems with
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
mechanics they don't know where to T it
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
you bring it to one mechanic they decide
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem with your car and
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's something trivial it's non-safety
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
like linear cracks in your headlights or
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
surface rust or something once they plug
 
02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
the car into the computer there you try
 
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
to take it to another mechanic most
 
02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
mechanics do not want to touch the car
 
02:08:29.709 --> 02:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to be accused of
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
doing like the what they call the lick
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
it and stick it thing where they're just
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
taking the car and running it through
 
02:08:36.189 --> 02:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
because it's already in the system
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of other problems with
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
um so there's no way to get a second
 
02:08:43.149 --> 02:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
opinion right now I'm I followed car
 
02:08:45.549 --> 02:08:45.559 align:start position:0%
inspection stuff for years I have never
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
heard of the program that the Dealers
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
Association runs for complain compl
 
02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
process so I would say that very very
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
few other people out there probably
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
heard of that program either so what
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
would make sense is that like many other
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
programs in the DMV if you have your
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
driver's license suspended there's a
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial process that goes on
 
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
within the DMV to appeal a driver's
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
license suspension and obviously you can
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
eventually go to court on that I would
 
02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
propose that the committee create an
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill that allows for a
 
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
similar due process if you have a
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
problem with the inspection station
 
02:09:18.510 --> 02:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
number one you could get a second an
 
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
opinion from another station without any
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
kind of problems there and number two
 
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
that there's some kind of hearing
 
02:09:27.069 --> 02:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
process that's expeditious in the DMV
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
where you can have them review what the
 
02:09:30.549 --> 02:09:30.559 align:start position:0%
mechanic said they can have experts say
 
02:09:32.510 --> 02:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay that mechanic was overreaching we
 
02:09:35.069 --> 02:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
can overrule that or something like that
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
um another idea that I came up that I
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
came up with just listening to the
 
02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative for the Dealers
 
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
Association talk about when you go to
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
mechanic like when you have to have work
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
done on your car there have the state
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
law I don't know what law it is but it
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
requires them to post a notice right
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
there that descri Des cribes like you
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
know your rights and and appeal rights
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
like if they give you a quote and they
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
go over the quote they're not allowed to
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
go over 10% and so on maybe some of
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
these appeal processes that already do
 
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
exist like this private one that's run
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
and the hardship for the OBD maybe
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
inspection station should be required to
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
post a notice right there on the desk
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
that says you have these appeal rights
 
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
if you disagree with what you get what
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
you get from this particular mechanic
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
that would be my main recommendations I
 
02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
like the bill the way it's written but
 
02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be amending it sending
 
02:10:18.669 --> 02:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
it to a subcommittee or something I'd be
 
02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
more than happy to help participate in
 
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
coming up with some ideas for like an
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
appeals process a mandatory notice
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
process something to make it easier for
 
02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
people to actually know that there's a
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
way of getting their car inspected if
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
they can't get it to their first
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
mechanic and they're worried about
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars of repairs because
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
the lights on um that's all I have to
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
say today and I'd be happy to take any
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:39.750 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
the

02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:43.629 --> 02:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank
 
02:10:46.990 --> 02:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
you chair I like to recognize Steve
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
zek uh who supports the bill asking for
 
02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:56.390 align:start position:0%
zek uh who supports the bill asking for
three

02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
minutes hi I'm Steve manik I'm live in
 
02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester I support the bill uh as even
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
as written I think it's a step in the
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
right direction but uh I don't think
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to solve a lot of problems um
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
I think the legislature has tried to fix
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
the uh inspection system a few times
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
over the years for example a couple
 
02:11:19.549 --> 02:11:19.559 align:start position:0%
years ago they had a bill is opposed to
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
eliminate what I would consider cosmetic
 
02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
rust from causing failures and yet years
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
later people are still getting hassled
 
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
over what I would consider cosmetic rust
 
02:11:32.589 --> 02:11:32.599 align:start position:0%
and fenders and stuff like that that
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
really don't impact safety so I'd rather
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
see the whole program just eliminated
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
but I know that's never going to happen
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
so you could you could dream um the
 
02:11:45.669 --> 02:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
things I do like about the bill is I
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
really like the uh elimination of of the
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh birthday annual birthday present of
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
having to go get an inspection sticker
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm my birthday is in the fall I'd
 
02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
much rather go and do everything for the
 
02:12:02.189 --> 02:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
year for my truck in the springtime
 
02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
because you know after the winter I you
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
know I'll spend a whole weekend working
 
02:12:08.189 --> 02:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
on it washing it and fixing whatever
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be repaired over the winter and
 
02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing I'd rather go and get
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
my inspection sticker done then and be
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
not have to think about it for the rest
 
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the year um so
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh and uh also uh I grew up in
 
02:12:27.669 --> 02:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um I'm not sure how it is
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
now it's I know it is pretty bad where
 
02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
they have setup cameras and all that
 
02:12:35.229 --> 02:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
sort of thing um but when I when I was
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
when I lived in Massachusetts on
 
02:12:39.069 --> 02:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
Saturdays a lot of mechanic shops just
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
had walk-in inspections where there's
 
02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
just a line of cars and you drive up you
 
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
wait in line you pull into the bay
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
and it's like a NASCAR pit stop uh where
 
02:12:53.709 --> 02:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
a couple guys come out with you know
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
floor jacks Jack the car up check it
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
real quick turn on your headlights turn
 
02:12:58.589 --> 02:12:58.599 align:start position:0%
on your left turn signal right turn
 
02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
signal honk the horn and uh you were out
 
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
of there in less than 15 minutes uh I've
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
gotten inspection stickers literally
 
02:13:08.669 --> 02:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
without getting out of the truck and
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's not like I went to some sketchy
 
02:13:13.589 --> 02:13:13.599 align:start position:0%
place or knew a guy I just went to the
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
place on you know the main drag uh that
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
does it on weekends so I when I moved to
 
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire many many years ago and I
 
02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
go get my inspection sticker I was just
 
02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
blown away at what a pain in the ass it
 
02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:29.069 align:start position:0%
blown away at what a pain in the ass it
was

02:13:29.069 --> 02:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
so um let's see what else I put down
 
02:13:35.709 --> 02:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
here uh and I am uh I the only thing
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
with Leah's bill is I think she should
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
replace the words linear crack with
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
hairline crack because linear just means
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
a straight line so um but I've seen
 
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
people fail for literally hairline
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
cracks that you could barely see and you
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't even feel with your fingernail
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
um and uh some of these headlights and
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
tail lights and stuff uh are really
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
really expensive right now um I had my
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
grandfather broke a tail light on his
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
car um putting something in the back of
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
it and it was a $300 just for the part
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
and that was with my employee discount
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I know on my truck one of
 
02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
the head like plastic housings is $500
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
each so uh if I have a tiny little
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
hairline crack uh I'm probably not going
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
to replace it until like it actually
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem so if I'm getting
 
02:14:34.549 --> 02:14:34.559 align:start position:0%
jammed up on an inspection sticker for a
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
tiny hairline crack and have to spend
 
02:14:39.069 --> 02:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
$500 just for the plastic housing I'm
 
02:14:41.790 --> 02:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
going to be very very
 
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
pissed um let's
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
see uh and I think that one of the
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
things is 20% of people fail inspection
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
every year and I think if 20% of the
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles on the road were really
 
02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
actually unsafe we would be having
 
02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
accidents all over the place but that's
 
02:15:04.189 --> 02:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
not the case
 
02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
um and it in New Hampshire is only one
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
of a few states that has an inspection
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
program uh and you know there's not
 
02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
really any noticeable difference and
 
02:15:16.030 --> 02:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
even if you look at accident statistics
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
and what percentage of accident are
 
02:15:22.830 --> 02:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
caused by uh a mechanical failure
 
02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
um you don't even necessarily know if
 
02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
those mechanical failures would have
 
02:15:28.870 --> 02:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
been detected by an inspection uh
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
because you could have a brand new tire
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
have a blowout and cause an
 
02:15:35.709 --> 02:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
accident um let's
 
02:15:35.719 --> 02:15:37.270 align:start position:0%
accident um let's
see

02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:15:40.830 --> 02:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
um and one thing I'd really like to see
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
is um if mechanics were able to have a
 
02:15:45.390 --> 02:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of leniency when they do an
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
inspection and rather than have it be
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
absolute pass or absolute fail if they
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
could just be like hey you should
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
probably fix this but you can still have
 
02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
your sticker there's no leniency in
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
letting them you know just give you a
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
caution on hey you should probably keep
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
an eye on this or you might want to
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
replace this in a couple months or
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's it's pass or
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
fail so if you have the tiniest little
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
bit of play in a bushing or something
 
02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to fail it and you could
 
02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
probably go for months and months and
 
02:16:16.669 --> 02:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
months and you know either save up money
 
02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
for the repair
 
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
or you know just wait until Springtime
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
or whatever it may be to to to take care
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
of it but it's always um you got to fix
 
02:16:28.589 --> 02:16:28.599 align:start position:0%
it right
 
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
now um and uh one thing that uh and one
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
thing about uh they mentioned like this
 
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
is a free market program I completely
 
02:16:40.270 --> 02:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
disagree and one of the things that I
 
02:16:43.230 --> 02:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
would Point as evidence that it's
 
02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and is not a free market is
 
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
even in states that don't have an
 
02:16:49.549 --> 02:16:49.559 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker program but have
 
02:16:51.549 --> 02:16:51.559 align:start position:0%
mandatory Insurance none of the
 
02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies ever require people
 
02:16:54.429 --> 02:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
to go and get an annual inspection on
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
their car so if it was truly a free
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
market and uh the uh it was actually an
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
issue that needed to be addressed the
 
02:17:05.549 --> 02:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
actuaries at these insurance companies
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
would totally require people go and get
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
their vehicles inspected every year but
 
02:17:14.349 --> 02:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
they don't um and one thing that I think
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
would probably be an improvement to the
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
system uh that might actually kind of
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit more difficult for
 
02:17:23.230 --> 02:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
some people but I would really improve
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
safety is uh I don't think that um
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
dealers should be allowed to sticker
 
02:17:29.309 --> 02:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
their own cars that they're selling if
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're selling a used car um I've gone
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
and with friends to go look at a car
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
they were thinking about buying and look
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
it over and um for example one time I uh
 
02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
I plugged my scan tool in and read the
 
02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:44.599 align:start position:0%
codes and I was getting all these um
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
codes for the ABS system the the lock
 
02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
brakes and um I wasn't seeing a light up
 
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
dashboard and when I took a really close
 
02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
look at the dashboard I noticed that
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
somebody painted over the um the uh OBD
 
02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
light on the
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
dashboard and uh and you know I think if
 
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
you're sell if you're the one selling
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
the car you're going to be a little bit
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
more lenient than you know the
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
inspection station is going to be
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
looking at the car um you know in a
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
couple months when here's your birthday
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
birthday again and uh the other thing is
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's no consistency between
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
inspection stations and or even the same
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
even two mechanics at the same
 
02:18:27.870 --> 02:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
inspection station um because it seems
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
like whenever anyone complains about the
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker process online
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
everybody comments well you went to the
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
wrong place you should have gone to you
 
02:18:37.389 --> 02:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
know Bob's Auto Repair instead of Jim's
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
auto repair uh if if the system was
 
02:18:42.429 --> 02:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
consistent it wouldn't matter and that's
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
all I have to say any questions thank
 
02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
you any questions for the committee not
 
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
seeing any thank you all right thank you
 
02:18:53.469 --> 02:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
chair i' like to call Lieutenant James o
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire State Police who
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill he's asking for 10
 
02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
minutes if he can make it a little bit
 
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
it good morning Mr chair and members of
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
the committee I will make it less than
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
10 minutes depending upon your
 
02:19:13.469 --> 02:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
questions um I have with me AI
 
02:19:15.309 --> 02:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
supervisor Ken chaput he oversees our
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
inspection program so he oversees the
 
02:19:20.910 --> 02:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
people that um conduct the audits of
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
inspection stations I brought him along
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
in case you had any specific questions
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
that I wasn't able to answer I'm not
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
going to go through everything uh line
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
by line uh most of the stuff that the
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
Auto Dealers Association said we're in
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
agreement with there are a couple of
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
things that I would like to kind of
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
highlight I do applaud the
 
02:19:41.309 --> 02:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this type of
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
a bill forward in the sense that I think
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
that from what I'm hearing from
 
02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative sers and representative
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
Koker you know we are in a scenario
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
where we want more clarification uh I
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
think collectively even industry
 
02:19:55.950 --> 02:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
included on what is safety related and
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
you know what is not safety related and
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
how can we make improvements to the
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
program uh the bill that she brought
 
02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
forth attempts to do that obviously it's
 
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
just that there are some things in there
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
that um I think that we need to look at
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
a little more closely to just make sure
 
02:20:11.550 --> 02:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
that we're making the appropriate
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
changes so for example like like Dan
 
02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
spoke about with the wooden bumper I'm
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
not sure what the wood makes that's the
 
02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
way the rues been maybe it's arbitration
 
02:20:22.590 --> 02:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
or maybe there was a purpose for it but
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
it would be nice to kind of look through
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
that first to make sure that that's a
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
proper change you know as it relates to
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
the headlight rule um when we start
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
making changes to rules and laws as it
 
02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
relates to the mechanics they need a way
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
in which they can conduct or perform the
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
test that's equal across the board we're
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
hearing that it's discretionary in
 
02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
different locations and how how are the
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
they are performing it we don't perform
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
currently a uh test on light intensity
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
so to determine whether or not rust or
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
crack or water or condensation you know
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
affect the proper application of the
 
02:20:57.150 --> 02:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
light would be difficult because we
 
02:20:59.309 --> 02:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
don't perform that test currently now if
 
02:21:01.870 --> 02:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
we were to explore language you know to
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
to address that that's uh something that
 
02:21:06.510 --> 02:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
we could look at so as it relates to
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
each one of those individual changes
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
um for for those types of reasons the
 
02:21:15.309 --> 02:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
testing reasons mainly uh how a mechanic
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
can perform a proper test to determine
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not a repair to uh an exhaust
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
is proper we again that opens it up for
 
02:21:24.510 --> 02:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation and that's what we're
 
02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get away from so I guess and
 
02:21:28.830 --> 02:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
long and short of it we would be looking
 
02:21:31.150 --> 02:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
to work on additional language to try to
 
02:21:32.830 --> 02:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
to put uh some more clarification
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
forward in that area as it relates to
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
notifications on the vehicle inspection
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
report we made changes to that over the
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
past year um currently there are
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
notifications that do allow a customer
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
to know that they can request an OBD
 
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
waiver the OBD waiver process
 
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair is a two-e
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
process uh it takes two weeks to turn
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
around that request and that waiver is
 
02:21:56.429 --> 02:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
good for one year that gives the
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
applicant a year to fix the OBD issue or
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
emissions issue that they have with
 
02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:00.469 align:start position:0%
emissions issue that they have with
their

02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
car um the idea
 
02:22:03.359 --> 02:22:04.910 align:start position:0%
car um the idea
of

02:22:04.910 --> 02:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
um the a complaint process again there
 
02:22:09.389 --> 02:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
there's that phone number that's in
 
02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
place currently on those virs and those
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
and that's uh those are investigations
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
that that we would uh follow up on not
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
knowing specific specifically what the
 
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
constituents are um having issues with
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
for their specific Vehicles it's tough
 
02:22:24.270 --> 02:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
to say like what areas we can make
 
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
improvements there but I would say uh
 
02:22:30.349 --> 02:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
the two last very quick topics one
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
changing the when the inspection is due
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
as much as I can appreciate the reason
 
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
for it I think it becomes challenging
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
for mechanics and vehicle owners to
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
remember when their inspection uh is due
 
02:22:43.150 --> 02:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
to expire at that point when you have
 
02:22:44.670 --> 02:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
multiple vehicles that expired at
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
different times um it it could be
 
02:22:48.429 --> 02:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
difficult for a consumer to remember
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
when their inspection is due and it does
 
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
take away that 16mon um ability for
 
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
somebody to have their vehicle inspected
 
02:22:59.309 --> 02:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
four months prior to uh the expiration
 
02:23:00.750 --> 02:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
the last part that I just want to speak
 
02:23:03.070 --> 02:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
to is the amount of time it takes to
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
conduct an inspection so we've heard for
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
a number of years the issues uh
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
involving inspection stations and that
 
02:23:13.950 --> 02:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
you know uh State Police and Company do
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh follow up on complaints uh that are
 
02:23:19.630 --> 02:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
that are forwarded to us and one of the
 
02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
things that is looked at is the amount
 
02:23:24.190 --> 02:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
of time it takes to perform uh an
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
inspection now the this the language in
 
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
here says we shall not require an
 
02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
inspection station to perform
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
inspections within any minimum or
 
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of time well currently we
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
do not we don't do that we don't require
 
02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
a minimum or maximum time limit on an
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
inspection um reading further no penalty
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
or audit should result based on the
 
02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
amount of time spent on inspections
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
whether individually or on average there
 
02:23:47.269 --> 02:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
is no penalty that currently takes place
 
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
dependent upon time however that being
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
said when one of our AIS goes to perform
 
02:23:55.630 --> 02:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
an audit one of the things that they do
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
look at is what's called a trigger
 
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
analysis report that report basically
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
lays out all inspections that are
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
conducted by an inspection station two
 
02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
things they look at one are they
 
02:24:06.190 --> 02:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
plugging in the vehicle that they're
 
02:24:07.790 --> 02:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to be plugging in so are they
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
bypassing tamper tampering emissions two
 
02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
how long are they taking in between
 
02:24:14.110 --> 02:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
inspections because if you see that
 
02:24:15.389 --> 02:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
there's a station that's performing
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
inspections every five minutes and and
 
02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
they have one inspector and they've
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
completed 50 inspections in an 8 hour
 
02:24:22.830 --> 02:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
period Then it tends to reason that
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's something that's not going on uh
 
02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
that's proper there and that and that
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
would be part of an audit so I guess you
 
02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
know our discussion currently with these
 
02:24:33.790 --> 02:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
station owners there is no repercussions
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
for any time constraints but we do have
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
a discussion uh during the audit to
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
determine what are they doing that is
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
inspections thank you any questions from
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
Veer thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I would like to
 
02:24:57.670 --> 02:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate what other reps have said that
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
this is one of the areas where I get the
 
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
most complaints um and a lot of it has
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
to do with the ambiguity between the
 
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
rules and the laws like I had a a
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
constituent who called me and was pretty
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
upset he he has rust but he was reading
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
the law and said uh it's not protruding
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's not loose it's not causing a hazard
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
why did I fail my inspection I said well
 
02:25:20.030 --> 02:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
called Troop G and see what they say and
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
he was told to go to a different
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
inspection station and if he passed then
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
he could b a plate he said I don't want
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
to have to pay a second inspection fee
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
so what does the the appeals process
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
look like and do you have to get do you
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
have to actually pass someplace else
 
02:25:36.429 --> 02:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
before you're accepted as a PL thank you
 
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
for your question so uh two components
 
02:25:40.830 --> 02:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
of that I do agree with you that rust uh
 
02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
is an area in which we could that you
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
know included in this law the language
 
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
here I actually think is is good it
 
02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
starts to kind of narrow down uh the
 
02:25:49.950 --> 02:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
issue with rust and uh what can be
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
what's what is a failure So currently
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
the way the process works is if they do
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
contact us um there are times in which
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
we will send out either an AI or a
 
02:26:00.269 --> 02:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
trooper to look at the vehicle to see
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should or should not
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
pass inspection the difficulty becomes
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
that we are not in the business of
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
conduct conducting motor vehicle
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
inspections um so if they do bring it to
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
another location and that uh person does
 
02:26:16.110 --> 02:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
pass the test and it does give us the
 
02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
ability to either address the if it if
 
02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
they have violated a rule it does g give
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
us the ability to go back and discuss
 
02:26:24.590 --> 02:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
that issue with that original Mechanic
 
02:26:26.070 --> 02:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
now that being said one of the gentlemen
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
that spoke earlier had I thought a
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
pretty good idea on the fact of having
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
an appeals process because that does
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
happen you could bring it to one
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
location and that person failures you
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
and if you do bring it to a second
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
location that person passes you what is
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
the recourse for a consumer um you know
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
some people know that they can call us
 
02:26:43.389 --> 02:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
and and there is a recourse but other
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
than that you may not be aware of it and
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
I think an administrative proceeding
 
02:26:47.870 --> 02:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
like like that might be something that's
 
02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
useful or at least worth talking about
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
question representative St Clair do you
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
have a question I do thank you and thank
 
02:27:00.349 --> 02:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
you yes sir um you said there was no
 
02:27:00.359 --> 02:27:01.269 align:start position:0%
you yes sir um you said there was no
time

02:27:01.269 --> 02:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
limit on on each side yes sir but five
 
02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
minutes raises a question in your mind
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
so I get that so where is the cut off
 
02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
where it doesn't raise a question there
 
02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
must be something in your mind that says
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
five minutes 10 minutes 15 thank you for
 
02:27:18.030 --> 02:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
your question so we don't necessarily
 
02:27:19.950 --> 02:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
look at one single uh inspection what
 
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is a pattern of
 
02:27:22.990 --> 02:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
inspection so when we see multiple
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are inspected over a
 
02:27:26.349 --> 02:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
period of time that let's say five 3 to
 
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
five minutes that these inspections are
 
02:27:30.150 --> 02:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
passing through that is an area in which
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
we would look at a little bit further
 
02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're also comparing what year
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles are we looking at are they 2005
 
02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
are they 15 20 years old and you know
 
02:27:41.309 --> 02:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
there's one shop that's passing 25 cars
 
02:27:43.950 --> 02:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
in an 8 hour period then uh it stands
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
the reason that there's concerned
 
02:27:46.269 --> 02:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not their vehicles are being
 
02:27:48.429 --> 02:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
properly inspected now if I were to see
 
02:27:50.349 --> 02:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
one car that was inspected in 5 minutes
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
that's not even something we would
 
02:27:53.070 --> 02:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
really look at it's more again it's a
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
pattern of behavior that we're looking
 
02:27:54.319 --> 02:27:55.269 align:start position:0%
pattern of behavior that we're looking
to

02:27:55.269 --> 02:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:27:58.510 --> 02:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
identify thank you representative foot
 
02:27:59.630 --> 02:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
lieutenant sir for my own edification so
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
the certification to inspect is that per
 
02:28:06.910 --> 02:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
the station or is that each employee so
 
02:28:09.230 --> 02:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
could that be the discrepancies amongst
 
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
these auto shops so the certification
 
02:28:14.269 --> 02:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
the the the station itself is licensed
 
02:28:16.750 --> 02:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
and then the mechanic is licensed it has
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
own certification if that I don't know
 
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
if I'm answering your question properly
 
02:28:21.309 --> 02:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
but essentially not everybody at the
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
location you could have an owner of the
 
02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
business who was not certified and a
 
02:28:27.870 --> 02:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
mechanic who is okay thank you yes sir
 
02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair um quick
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned the trigger
 
02:28:39.389 --> 02:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
analysis yes sir um how often is that
 
02:28:41.550 --> 02:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
done and is it done electronically
 
02:28:42.910 --> 02:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
through central office because
 
02:28:46.190 --> 02:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
everything's online versus how often our
 
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
physical uh inspections done at
 
02:28:49.990 --> 02:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
inspection stations thank you for your
 
02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
question so the trigger analysis is
 
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
generated during an audit so every uh
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
every two years we try to get into audit
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
every station of course there's seven
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
people that do it
 
02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
and 1,700 stations so we do the best we
 
02:29:08.750 --> 02:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
can with that um so every two years
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're auditing stations and uh at that
 
02:29:13.150 --> 02:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
time is when that trigger analysis
 
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
report is pulled and that is an
 
02:29:16.750 --> 02:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
electronic report that's uh generated
 
02:29:19.630 --> 02:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
through Gordon Darby our our uh our
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
vendor that does our uh online
 
02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
stickering thank you thank you
 
02:29:28.750 --> 02:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr chair so some of the
 
02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
complaints I've actually had is is
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
Fender rust and also uh believe it or
 
02:29:35.230 --> 02:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
not I don't know how it's possible but
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
having rust on the
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
brakes that cause failure and also I
 
02:29:44.349 --> 02:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
mean uh a wheel bearing you know uh how
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
do you how do you determine the wheel
 
02:29:48.750 --> 02:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
bearing is is actually bad at that point
 
02:29:52.030 --> 02:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
or is it you know what margin is there
 
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
on stuff like that thank you for your
 
02:29:55.630 --> 02:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
question as far as the wheel bearing is
 
02:29:57.150 --> 02:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
concerned there's a manufacturer
 
02:29:59.790 --> 02:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
specification for each vehicle and so
 
02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
when the mechanic is doing the test they
 
02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
will measure the amount of play that
 
02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
using one of their tools and they will
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
determine they'll compare that that play
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
that that looseness if you will in that
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
component to whatever the manufacturer
 
02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
specifications are so if it's beyond
 
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
that limit then it is required to be
 
02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:19.550 align:start position:0%
that limit then it is required to be
replaced

02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:21.950 --> 02:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
one more followup thank you I'm sorry
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
this is this is some of the things that
 
02:30:26.990 --> 02:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
the consumer doesn't know and so when
 
02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
they go into the garage they they they
 
02:30:31.710 --> 02:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
say yeah you got wheel bearing play but
 
02:30:33.870 --> 02:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
it's never as said according to your
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
specs I mean how do how does the
 
02:30:37.389 --> 02:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
consumer deal with stuff like that they
 
02:30:39.269 --> 02:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
just said yeah your wheel bearing is
 
02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
failing yeah well thank you for your
 
02:30:43.230 --> 02:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
question I you know a lot of that is
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
contingent upon the the inspection
 
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
station they go to to some of them will
 
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
supply with those specifications and
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
some of them just don't um as a matter
 
02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
of course so um it really would be
 
02:30:55.269 --> 02:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
contingent upon who they're dealing with
 
02:30:57.630 --> 02:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
and um you know and potentially asking
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
that question for the information but to
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
your point would the average consumer
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
know to ask that question or what
 
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're looking for probably
 
02:31:07.070 --> 02:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
not any other
 
02:31:10.269 --> 02:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you very
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
much at this point I have nobody else
 
02:31:14.990 --> 02:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
who wants to testify I will close the
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.359 --> 02:32:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
1637

02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open up the public hearing
 
02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1273 FN relative to the
 
02:33:02.510 --> 02:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
protection of personal information and
 
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses chair recognizes the
 
02:33:07.870 --> 02:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative ol good
 
02:33:09.389 --> 02:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
afterno thank you Mr chair for the
 
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jordan oler Hillsboro
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
13 this bill was introduced because of
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
some personal experiences and some
 
02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh complaints of uh residents within uh
 
02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
the town of Hudson uh previously I had
 
02:33:25.750 --> 02:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
experience with CVS which has been
 
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
successfully uh resolved wherein if you
 
02:33:31.349 --> 02:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
went and got a prescription CVS would
 
02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:33.640 align:start position:0%
scan your driver's license record the
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
information and then share that with the
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
National Police Department particularly
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
with uh um uh the purchase of narcotic
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
information CVS is sense because of
 
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
existing law under RSA 264 14 stopped
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
supposedly stopped that practice at
 
02:33:52.910 --> 02:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
least they have for me when I pick up
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
stuff for my wife as a result of the
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
both either or both CVS retaining the
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
information and the natural police
 
02:34:04.830 --> 02:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
retaining the information several things
 
02:34:08.110 --> 02:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
took place firstly we're getting
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
advertisements regarding the type of uh
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
medication my wife is taking for chronic
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
illness secondly the National Police are
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
now aware of the medical condition of my
 
02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
wife information to which they have no
 
02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:29.870 align:start position:0%
wife information to which they have no
legitimate

02:34:29.870 --> 02:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
purpose more recently however I was able
 
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
to ship some packages down to family
 
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
members I went to FedEx over on Amber
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
Street in Nashville and they scanned the
 
02:34:44.030 --> 02:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
driver's license and recorded all the
 
02:34:46.429 --> 02:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
information on the driver's license and
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
they were told it was perfectly illegal
 
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:34:53.230 --> 02:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
that except I don't believe it
 
02:34:56.309 --> 02:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
is this bill attempts to impose
 
02:34:59.070 --> 02:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
penalties upon uh individuals or
 
02:35:02.910 --> 02:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
businesses entities that record that
 
02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
information uh if they uh lose it or if
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
it they get hacked or whatever the
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license information by
 
02:35:14.269 --> 02:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
definition belongs to the driver and for
 
02:35:17.309 --> 02:35:17.319 align:start position:0%
legitimate law enforcement
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
purposes but allowing businesses to
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
access the information that is on that
 
02:35:26.190 --> 02:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
through whatever means whether it's just
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
this or that or a section of it or
 
02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:29.790 align:start position:0%
this or that or a section of it or
something

02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
else defeats the purpose of maintaining
 
02:35:35.469 --> 02:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
privacy of your driver information which
 
02:35:39.389 --> 02:35:39.399 align:start position:0%
was the impetus uh when uh represent
 
02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
then representative Neil Kirk passed RSA
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
2614 tweaks have been made to the law to
 
02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
allow for legitimate access and
 
02:35:51.870 --> 02:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
legitimate access to some of that
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
information should be allowed for a
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
caseby casee specific purpose however
 
02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
there's no reason in the world that uh
 
02:36:07.309 --> 02:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
let's say Irving Gas should uh
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
demand you either scan your driver's
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
license at an Irving station or you send
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
them a photocopy of your driver's
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
license with all of the data that's out
 
02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
contained on it to them in order to sign
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
up for Irving pay uh as an example or
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
should any other um uh company engaged
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
in that particular activity a quick
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
check at the uh the people opposed to
 
02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
this bill indicate that they are engaged
 
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
in the financial trades and I do believe
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh the financial trades are already
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
excluded under existing law uh this
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
would be for other businesses to take
 
02:36:44.790 --> 02:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
place the fact of the matter uh
 
02:36:47.550 --> 02:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues is that uh our driver's
 
02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
license information is not private and
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
yet we have a constitutional obligation
 
02:36:57.349 --> 02:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
I think it's 2B part one 2B which says
 
02:36:59.150 --> 02:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
that we have a right to privacy on the
 
02:37:01.870 --> 02:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
information that the government contains
 
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
well either we do or we don't and if
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're just going to allow everyone to
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
have access to this information and do
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
it willy-nilly with no penalty for them
 
02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
why do we have the bill why do we have
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
that law in the first place why are we
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
keeping some information private why not
 
02:37:23.389 --> 02:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
just say it's all public now I do have
 
02:37:25.950 --> 02:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
problems with some of RSA
 
02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
2614 because of what happened over in
 
02:37:30.030 --> 02:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
Milford and what happened in Lichfield
 
02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
with property taxes regarding actually
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle taxes where there was uh
 
02:37:38.590 --> 02:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
well some people went to jail for it uh
 
02:37:40.750 --> 02:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
because of uh and that was discovered by
 
02:37:45.269 --> 02:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
individuals who pulled records uh and
 
02:37:48.349 --> 02:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
and took a look comparing the the the
 
02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
charges that were made by their
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
neighbors but for legitimate purpose on
 
02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
a case- by casee basis the same standard
 
02:37:59.269 --> 02:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
that applies to the police and if you
 
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
remember recently in newspapers a police
 
02:38:04.870 --> 02:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
officer was uh indicted by the Attorney
 
02:38:08.389 --> 02:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
General's office for that uh that's
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine that's that's
 
02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
understandable and that's reasonable but
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
on a broad basis of doing it to ship a
 
02:38:18.750 --> 02:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
package by FedEx to get a prescription
 
02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:20.590 align:start position:0%
package by FedEx to get a prescription
from

02:38:20.590 --> 02:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
CVS to order a uh an automatic bill pay
 
02:38:27.150 --> 02:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
off off of your uh cell
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
phone to be held by some third party
 
02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
someplace for per imp perpetuity where
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
you have no control over it
 
02:38:41.269 --> 02:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
whatsoever seems to me to be a bit much
 
02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
um I hope I did a a reasonable job in
 
02:38:45.439 --> 02:38:46.389 align:start position:0%
um I hope I did a a reasonable job in
putting

02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
putting
 
02:38:49.469 --> 02:38:49.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh this the information in here some
 
02:38:52.510 --> 02:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
of it is addition to existing uh law
 
02:38:55.309 --> 02:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
some of it is not um I would also
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
indicate that uh most of our driver's
 
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
licenses are carrying a gold well it's
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
not a gold star it's a clear star
 
02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
instead of a go gold Circle for real ID
 
02:39:09.950 --> 02:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that only verifies to a to an
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
individual and it's also contained in
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
the scanning information that the uh
 
02:39:16.990 --> 02:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
person has been
 
02:39:19.230 --> 02:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
verified I don't know how many of you
 
02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
are getting phone calls to the tune of
 
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 a day regarding your um
 
02:39:28.030 --> 02:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare that it's now the Open
 
02:39:31.349 --> 02:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
Enrollment program for Medicare it which
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
is a state funed program did you know
 
02:39:36.110 --> 02:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
that I didn't know that Medicare was
 
02:39:38.309 --> 02:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
state funded but you know there's a scam
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
running around uh for mature
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:53.910 --> 02:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
information when you find that
 
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
information it should
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
probably be a penalty for the violation
 
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
of your private
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
information so i' be happy to answer any
 
02:40:06.870 --> 02:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions although I do have caucus and
 
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
then a uh executive across the
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
hall thank you representative any
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative sellers Mr chair I just
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
wonder who else is speaking on this I
 
02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
have signed up uh Dan Bennett from NADA
 
02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:30.830 --> 02:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
infantine I do have one question sir for
 
02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
full disclosure uh I was also infuriated
 
02:40:37.230 --> 02:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
with uh the U grocery stores Irvings ra
 
02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
AIDS all that collecting my personal
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
information by mandating that they scan
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
it I went to file a bill and they told
 
02:40:44.830 --> 02:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
me I couldn't because yours was too
 
02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:47.510 align:start position:0%
me I couldn't because yours was too
similar

02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
um um so here we are the question I have
 
02:40:55.230 --> 02:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh because what infuriated me was that I
 
02:40:57.309 --> 02:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
was told well this is the solution you
 
02:40:59.349 --> 02:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
don't have to give up your information
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
you just can't shop here or you don't
 
02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
have to buy the products here which I
 
02:41:04.510 --> 02:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
think is outrageous does your bill
 
02:41:07.070 --> 02:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
address that does it prohibit a business
 
02:41:09.550 --> 02:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
from denying service to you if you
 
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
merely want to show them your license as
 
02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to them scanning it which I'm
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
fine with they need to be able to verify
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
I have no problem showing my ID to to
 
02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
pick up my my wife uses narcotics I have
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
no problem showing that this is who I am
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
I don't even have any problem with them
 
02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
writing that name down to show who
 
02:41:33.630 --> 02:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
picked up that particular um um drug I
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
do have a problem with them scanning the
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
information off of it retaining that
 
02:41:40.110 --> 02:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
information as for a business to denying
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
access which it seems to me that would
 
02:41:43.830 --> 02:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
come under uh the facult that you're
 
02:41:46.269 --> 02:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
open to the public and uh to deny person
 
02:41:50.190 --> 02:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
because of you know race Creed color
 
02:41:54.429 --> 02:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
whatever uh brings us back to the 40s
 
02:41:57.710 --> 02:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
rather than the 20s yep fair enough
 
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Hill thank
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
my question um my problem is the retain
 
02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
the word you just used the retaining of
 
02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
the information and
 
02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm not sure what we do when
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
um the vendor says um we're not
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
retaining it um Andor it's company
 
02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
policy so um I wondered if you would
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
comment on either of those two
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
things if they say they're not retaining
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
it and they do and then there's later a
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
breach you have a proof that they they
 
02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
were U misleading the
 
02:42:39.309 --> 02:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
public scanning it for an instantaneous
 
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
analysis still releases that information
 
02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
and is being held someplace for a period
 
02:42:47.349 --> 02:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
of time showing it on the other hand is
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
you still have access to it here see
 
02:42:52.429 --> 02:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
this is who I am thank you very much
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
good day I'm I'm over 21 I can buy
 
02:42:57.670 --> 02:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol I I'm over 21 I can buy
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
cigarettes alcohol yes cigarettes not so
 
02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
much won't say anything about a small
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
store in Kingsboro uh
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
but the um retaining of it is the
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
serious situation and that should be
 
02:43:19.469 --> 02:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
barred one way or
 
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
another yep follow up the company policy
 
02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
answer um well the company policy we get
 
02:43:29.230 --> 02:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
to tell the companies we get to tell the
 
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
towns and cities what the law is the
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
company policy needs to conform around
 
02:43:38.269 --> 02:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
that a company policy could be that the
 
02:43:40.429 --> 02:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
ball tires are perfect you just did
 
02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle inspection company policy
 
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
doing could be uh all tires are
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine uh but state law says
 
02:43:52.110 --> 02:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:54.990 --> 02:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
tread representative sellers thank you
 
02:43:58.230 --> 02:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was told by the DMV
 
02:43:59.830 --> 02:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
the barcode on the back when it is
 
02:44:02.550 --> 02:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
scanned reads every single piece of
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
information on the front that's that
 
02:44:06.990 --> 02:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
they can actually see now I'm not sure
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
if the how do we how do we know that a
 
02:44:12.910 --> 02:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh a merchant is retaining that
 
02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
information without without doing
 
02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
investigation that comes to the point of
 
02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
scanning the driver's license in the
 
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
first place just bar the scanning
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
therefore you know that that information
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
is not being retained either
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
purposefully for marketing purposes or
 
02:44:32.750 --> 02:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
incidentally because they didn't bother
 
02:44:34.349 --> 02:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
to put in software to block it or
 
02:44:37.630 --> 02:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:40.110 --> 02:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
it okay seeing no other questions thank
 
02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:41.950 align:start position:0%

02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
infantine representing himself opposed
 
02:45:02.429 --> 02:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:05.870 --> 02:45:05.880 align:start position:0%

Manchester and I'm the uh chairman of
 
02:45:12.349 --> 02:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
the labor committee I don't come in
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
front of Transportation often so it's
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
nice to see you folks
 
02:45:18.030 --> 02:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
it pains me to come and and speak
 
02:45:23.070 --> 02:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
against my good friend's bill um I too
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
like he protect my privacy and I take it
 
02:45:30.630 --> 02:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
seriously and thinking about testifying
 
02:45:34.349 --> 02:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
today I had to give my ID to give blood
 
02:45:38.269 --> 02:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
yes last week um I traveled this weekend
 
02:45:40.910 --> 02:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I had to give my identification my ID
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
to go on an airplane rent a car and go
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
to a hotel so uh it's always interesting
 
02:45:49.070 --> 02:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
to me you know who has my
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
information I'm speaking today purely
 
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
from a business standpoint I'm an
 
02:45:55.590 --> 02:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
insurance agent I've owned an insurance
 
02:45:58.510 --> 02:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
agency for 25 years and part of the
 
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
information I need to get someone
 
02:46:02.469 --> 02:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
insurance for a
 
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle um is their driving record and
 
02:46:07.030 --> 02:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
to get that insurance companies need
 
02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
your driver's license numbers so I
 
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
routinely my company routinely takes
 
02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
that information we keep it in our
 
02:46:17.950 --> 02:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
files and then we present it to an
 
02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:19.469 align:start position:0%
files and then we present it to an
insurance

02:46:19.469 --> 02:46:19.479 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:46:21.950 --> 02:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
company so someone can you know get a
 
02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
quote for their insurance so while I do
 
02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:26.269 align:start position:0%
quote for their insurance so while I do
protect

02:46:26.269 --> 02:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
protect
 
02:46:29.190 --> 02:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
my privacy and I like some of the things
 
02:46:31.389 --> 02:46:31.399 align:start position:0%
the the presenter of the bill stated
 
02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
there's some things I just can't live
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
with to be able to transact
 
02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
business um I do possess information I
 
02:46:41.910 --> 02:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't know how I possess it I I would
 
02:46:43.710 --> 02:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
have to go through thousands of
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
different uh people's names and policies
 
02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
on my computer to find out whose
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
information I have retained some people
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
will send us screenshots of their
 
02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:54.269 align:start position:0%
will send us screenshots of their
driver's

02:46:54.269 --> 02:46:54.279 align:start position:0%
driver's
 
02:46:57.469 --> 02:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
licenses so um getting rid of that bill
 
02:47:00.510 --> 02:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
requires me to get rid of that secondly
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
um if I any private business that shares
 
02:47:04.309 --> 02:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
personal information of a driver's
 
02:47:07.389 --> 02:47:07.399 align:start position:0%
license could be up a penalty of $10,000
 
02:47:10.510 --> 02:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm guilty I do it I have no other
 
02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
choice if you want an insurance quote
 
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
for your home and your your vehic icle I
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
have to share that information with an
 
02:47:17.359 --> 02:47:18.630 align:start position:0%
have to share that information with an
insurance

02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:47:21.469 --> 02:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
company so try to think of all the
 
02:47:25.230 --> 02:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
different businesses um that do things
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
for legitimate reasons to
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
help you know our our constituents here
 
02:47:33.950 --> 02:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the state versus other ones which
 
02:47:37.349 --> 02:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
without question may utilize information
 
02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
to Market or sell you something or for
 
02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:41.349 align:start position:0%
to Market or sell you something or for
inappropriate

02:47:41.349 --> 02:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
reasons so for that reason unfortunately
 
02:47:46.110 --> 02:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
I do oppose the bill
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and for I guess I should probably let
 
02:47:52.630 --> 02:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
you know that I do um I am the New
 
02:47:54.429 --> 02:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative to the national
 
02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
board of directors of insurance agents
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so as I've said before I'm the
 
02:48:02.469 --> 02:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
biggest Insurance geek in in the room um
 
02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
so you know for those reasons I just
 
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh I we just wouldn't be able to live
 
02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:09.230 align:start position:0%
uh I we just wouldn't be able to live
with

02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
this thank you very much thank you um I
 
02:48:15.389 --> 02:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
do have a question I'll lead with you
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
say you're doing it now doing it now is
 
02:48:19.950 --> 02:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
that in violation of the current law
 
02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
too when someone when we well in your
 
02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:23.950 align:start position:0%
too when someone when we well in your
your

02:48:23.950 --> 02:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
industry am I currently violating New
 
02:48:28.670 --> 02:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law by by retaining the
 
02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
information if I am every insurance
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
agent in this in the state is so um I
 
02:48:36.429 --> 02:48:36.439 align:start position:0%
don't believe I'm violating the current
 
02:48:39.269 --> 02:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
law okay well what I my my I guess I
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
probably should have started at a
 
02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
different direction would you be opposed
 
02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
to because we do have some exceptions to
 
02:48:47.230 --> 02:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
the law for certain businesses would you
 
02:48:48.710 --> 02:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
be opposed to and what would would have
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
changed your opinion if there was a more
 
02:48:53.429 --> 02:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
detailed uh exemption to the insurance
 
02:48:56.790 --> 02:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
industry for legitimate purposes yes of
 
02:48:59.910 --> 02:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
course thank you represent sers on the
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
same line I was thinking thank you Mr
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
chair I was thinking would you uh not be
 
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to because hipper allows sharing
 
02:49:09.550 --> 02:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
information from doctor to doctor things
 
02:49:12.230 --> 02:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
like that would that same type of
 
02:49:14.269 --> 02:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
sharing would if we put an exception in
 
02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
here work
 
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
yes it
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
would because we share repeatedly
 
02:49:22.469 --> 02:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
especially if someone um insurance
 
02:49:24.990 --> 02:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
companies as you all know sometimes your
 
02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
policy increases from one year to the
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
other so your agent's responsibility is
 
02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
to present it to all his cares to see if
 
02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
he can do something different so I could
 
02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
be doing this you know taking one
 
02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
person's information a husband a wife
 
02:49:39.309 --> 02:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
who live in a home and sharing their
 
02:49:41.309 --> 02:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
information with 10 different insurance
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
companies every two
 
02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:45.510 align:start position:0%
companies every two
years

02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee representa I saw
 
02:49:51.469 --> 02:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:00.510 --> 02:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
um you understand of course the fear
 
02:50:02.429 --> 02:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
that or the difference I guess is the
 
02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
best word the difference between an
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
insurance company where you have a fixed
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
business and you're somebody you're
 
02:50:09.790 --> 02:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with and going into a
 
02:50:12.990 --> 02:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
convenience store or into a a bar where
 
02:50:14.830 --> 02:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
they're scanning all this information
 
02:50:16.269 --> 02:50:16.279 align:start position:0%
you do understand the difference in the
 
02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
fear so what's the what do you think
 
02:50:24.469 --> 02:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
amendment it's very
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
difficult I again as I said I don't like
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
sharing my information but we have so
 
02:50:34.590 --> 02:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
many inconsistencies
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
here as I was speaking to the chairman
 
02:50:40.349 --> 02:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
prior to the the bill there is is there
 
02:50:42.550 --> 02:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
possibly something out there where the
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
department of uh Liquor Commission comes
 
02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
down on a a place for not scanning or
 
02:50:49.950 --> 02:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
not getting information I don't know
 
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
some of the inconsistencies we have it
 
02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
has become it has
 
02:50:57.550 --> 02:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
become um the Wild Wild West out there
 
02:50:59.389 --> 02:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
grabbing your identification for almost
 
02:51:01.190 --> 02:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
anything and unfortunately we've all
 
02:51:03.950 --> 02:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
accepted it we just do it as a course of
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
business not knowing what information
 
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're giving out to someone we just
 
02:51:09.269 --> 02:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
figured okay they looking at our date of
 
02:51:11.469 --> 02:51:11.479 align:start position:0%

basically in line 15 um where it says
 
02:52:28.750 --> 02:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
but shall not electronically capture
 
02:52:31.950 --> 02:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
retain copy or place in a consumer file
 
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
any personal information from uh the
 
02:52:36.750 --> 02:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license that personal
 
02:52:41.309 --> 02:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
information is required for us to use um
 
02:52:43.630 --> 02:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh to process a title application a
 
02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration application um so
 
02:52:49.750 --> 02:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
we we in fact need that um our lending
 
02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
institutions require it of us um before
 
02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh finance a significant
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
amount of money um a vehicle dealer also
 
02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
really wants to know who you are before
 
02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
you take one of their vehicles whether
 
02:53:06.349 --> 02:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's a $6,000 car or a $60,000 Ram
 
02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
pickup um and go for a test drive so
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
they take a copy of your driver's
 
02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:12.110 align:start position:0%
they take a copy of your driver's
license

02:53:12.110 --> 02:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
um you can always
 
02:53:16.670 --> 02:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh have that conversation with them if
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
you're not comfortable with surrendering
 
02:53:20.469 --> 02:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
that information but the consumer offers
 
02:53:23.309 --> 02:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
it up they know that you know in order
 
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
to test drive this vehicle we're going
 
02:53:27.550 --> 02:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
to share that information with you
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
um our dealers are are subject to
 
02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
complex Federal Regulations it's a real
 
02:53:35.990 --> 02:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory maze is what we refer to um
 
02:53:38.670 --> 02:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
with an alphabet soup of acronyms of um
 
02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
regulating agencies but specifically
 
02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the privacy and
 
02:53:44.670 --> 02:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
safeguarding of consumer cons consumers
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
information we're subject to intense
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations through the gram
 
02:53:52.429 --> 02:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
leech B act um and they have significant
 
02:53:55.309 --> 02:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
penalties um as well as operational
 
02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
requirements uh you know many dealers
 
02:53:59.910 --> 02:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
actually have on staff a compliance
 
02:54:02.269 --> 02:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
officer um just to deal with both state
 
02:54:05.389 --> 02:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
and federal regs but in this area um
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
we're subject to uh the federal um
 
02:54:10.910 --> 02:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
privacy and safeguards role
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that there are many
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
other business organiz ations um opposed
 
02:54:18.630 --> 02:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
to the bill as well um as you heard you
 
02:54:20.229 --> 02:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
know the scanning of a driver's license
 
02:54:23.910 --> 02:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
just is is so commonplace these days um
 
02:54:25.710 --> 02:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
the other day I happened to walk into my
 
02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
physical therapist's office and in order
 
02:54:29.710 --> 02:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
to get in I had to scan my driver's
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
license on a scanner and then on the
 
02:54:34.150 --> 02:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
iPad screen above it it told me which
 
02:54:36.190 --> 02:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
room to go to and which doctor I would
 
02:54:38.110 --> 02:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
be with negating the need for a
 
02:54:40.429 --> 02:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
receptionist um but that's how it's done
 
02:54:42.990 --> 02:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
at this particular physical therapist um
 
02:54:45.150 --> 02:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
I can attest to the same thing at rental
 
02:54:48.030 --> 02:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
car agencies checking in at the airport
 
02:54:49.870 --> 02:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
um not to pick on anyone airline jet
 
02:54:51.870 --> 02:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
blue requires you to scan your driver's
 
02:54:53.630 --> 02:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
license in order to be able to check in
 
02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:54.990 align:start position:0%
license in order to be able to check in
so

02:54:54.990 --> 02:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:00.070 --> 02:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
um so um with that being said um you
 
02:55:02.670 --> 02:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
know um I want to remind you that we do
 
02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill um however well intended
 
02:55:07.870 --> 02:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
um and then when it comes to um
 
02:55:09.070 --> 02:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
represent of Hill when it comes to the
 
02:55:11.550 --> 02:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
issue of retaining the information there
 
02:55:13.389 --> 02:55:13.399 align:start position:0%
are instances when retaining that
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
information is a good thing and I would
 
02:55:18.670 --> 02:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
say when it comes to fraudulent or uh
 
02:55:20.190 --> 02:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
what we deal with sometimes are called
 
02:55:22.269 --> 02:55:22.279 align:start position:0%
straw man purchases where someone
 
02:55:24.269 --> 02:55:24.279 align:start position:0%
purchases a vehicle for someone else
 
02:55:25.349 --> 02:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
they then do something they're not
 
02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to do like export the vehicle or
 
02:55:29.790 --> 02:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is used in a crime sometimes
 
02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
retaining that information can in fact
 
02:55:35.150 --> 02:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
be helpful um for uh as mentioned fraud
 
02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
or crime prevention um and then um
 
02:55:40.830 --> 02:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
chairman Walsh to your point about
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
whether we'd be open to exploring the
 
02:55:45.990 --> 02:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
issue with you all uh for for certain uh
 
02:55:49.389 --> 02:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
industry exemptions um we would uh
 
02:55:51.469 --> 02:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
welcome to be part of that discussion if
 
02:55:53.750 --> 02:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
in fact that's what you choose to do and
 
02:55:55.150 --> 02:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be the first time that
 
02:55:57.190 --> 02:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
discussion's been had uh I believe it
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
was a session or two ago there was a
 
02:56:01.590 --> 02:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
bill in the Senate uh that dealt with
 
02:56:03.710 --> 02:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
exemptions for stuff like this for uh
 
02:56:06.750 --> 02:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
both retail vehicle dealers um and
 
02:56:08.510 --> 02:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
importantly the bill stemmed from um the
 
02:56:10.830 --> 02:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
medical community for the requiring of
 
02:56:13.389 --> 02:56:13.399 align:start position:0%
of scan scanning so we would be open to
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
participating that discussion uh if you
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
so choose um so with that being said um
 
02:56:20.990 --> 02:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'll kind of wrap up there and uh answer
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
any questions if there AR
 
02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
any thank you you saved my question
 
02:56:30.429 --> 02:56:30.439 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair thank you Mr
 
02:56:32.349 --> 02:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you I I want to go to
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
your personal experience at your for
 
02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
your physical what was it Physical
 
02:56:39.710 --> 02:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
Therapy physical therapy so when you go
 
02:56:42.229 --> 02:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
and you put the card or they scan the
 
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
card there's nobody there you can talk
 
02:56:47.070 --> 02:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
to so this is to just replace having an
 
02:56:49.750 --> 02:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
employee there I scanned my driver's
 
02:56:51.510 --> 02:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
license and then the screen popped up
 
02:56:55.150 --> 02:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
and said room 104 take a left Dr yeah I
 
02:56:56.229 --> 02:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
just was curious if there was an
 
02:56:58.830 --> 02:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
employee there okay thank you I'm sure
 
02:56:59.790 --> 02:56:59.800 align:start position:0%

02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:05.429 --> 02:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
but well I know the proliferation of
 
02:57:07.790 --> 02:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
scanning is out there as you said and
 
02:57:09.750 --> 02:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's another example but have you ever
 
02:57:13.030 --> 02:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
heard of William Penn I believe he said
 
02:57:15.790 --> 02:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
wrong is wrong even if everybody is in
 
02:57:17.670 --> 02:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
favor of it so let what this bill is
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%

Marine Corps in 2004 and despite scoring
 
03:41:30.790 --> 03:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
a perfect score of 99 on the am Aron

my recruiter insisting I could do any
 
03:41:36.750 --> 03:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
job I wanted I chose to join the

Infantry I wanted to be the first to
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
fight I wanted to fine and kill those
 
03:41:43.149 --> 03:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
responsible for September 11th attacks
 
03:41:45.149 --> 03:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
my patriotism was supercharged and I
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
would do anything for my country I never
 
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
got a chance to go after Bin Laden
 
03:41:53.229 --> 03:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
instead I was deployed to Iraq twice I
 
03:41:55.070 --> 03:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
didn't understand foreign policy and I
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
believed the propaganda about Li uh ties
 
03:41:59.790 --> 03:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
to 911 and weapons of mass
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
destruction uh I deployed with Third
 
03:42:03.429 --> 03:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
Battalion six Marines and took part in
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
operations Iron Fist and Steel Curtain
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
in the alheim region in the al-anbar
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
province along the Syrian
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
border we never found weapons of mass
 
03:42:14.110 --> 03:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
destruction only a growing Insurgency
 
03:42:16.269 --> 03:42:16.279 align:start position:0%
that resented our presence contrary to
 
03:42:17.870 --> 03:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
the claims of the news media that the
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
Iraqi people would welcome us with open
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
arms as liberators we now know today
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the Iraq War was based on lies my
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
patriotism was exploited for these lies
 
03:42:29.070 --> 03:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
and I watched friends of mine get killed
 
03:42:31.710 --> 03:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
and maimed by vbieds mortar strikes
 
03:42:34.349 --> 03:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
Small Arms fire and for
 
03:42:37.070 --> 03:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
what a chunk of Iraq fell to Isis
 
03:42:38.590 --> 03:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
because we decimated the country's
 
03:42:41.070 --> 03:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
ability to defend itself we then had to
 
03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
go back in and clean up the mess we made
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
and we are remaining there to this day
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
despite protests of the Dem
 
03:42:49.710 --> 03:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
democratically elected government do we
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
support democracy in Iraq or don't we I
 
03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the experiences of those
 
03:42:56.110 --> 03:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
that served in Afghanistan but the
 
03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
outcome there is not very different 20
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
years thousands of lives trillions of
 
03:43:01.790 --> 03:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
dollars to take the country from the
 
03:43:05.469 --> 03:43:05.479 align:start position:0%
Taliban and return it to the Taliban
 
03:43:07.070 --> 03:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's a union leader article written
 
03:43:08.469 --> 03:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
about this bill and I want to address
 
03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
their complaints verely they mention our
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
victory over Isis which is an
 
03:43:14.070 --> 03:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
organization that would never have
 
03:43:16.030 --> 03:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
existed if we didn't invade Iraq and
 
03:43:18.269 --> 03:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
ferment rebellion in Syria against
 
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
Bashar al-assad the moderate Rebels we
 
03:43:22.469 --> 03:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
trained in the early days of the Syrian
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
Civil War helped form
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
Isis so if the author wants to put uh to
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
P for us to Pat ourselves on the back
 
03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
for killing an enemy we created that's
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
like congratulating yourself for putting
 
03:43:34.990 --> 03:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
out a kitchen fire you started while
 
03:43:37.870 --> 03:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
admiring the ashes the article then goes
 
03:43:39.389 --> 03:43:39.399 align:start position:0%
on to claim that the massive military
 
03:43:40.830 --> 03:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
campaign in in Afghanistan was a
 
03:43:42.990 --> 03:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
prerequisite to having a staging point
 
03:43:45.189 --> 03:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
to the to then execute the Seal team
 
03:43:47.830 --> 03:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
mission in Jal alabad Pakistan and Ally
 
03:43:50.670 --> 03:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
nation of ours to get Bin Laden yet we
 
03:43:52.149 --> 03:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
remained in Afghanistan for another
 
03:43:54.910 --> 03:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
decade following his death for what
 
03:43:58.030 --> 03:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
purpose intelligence agencies located
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
Bin Laden independent of military
 
03:44:01.910 --> 03:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
operations in Afghanistan where our men
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
were getting killed by roadside bombs
 
03:44:05.670 --> 03:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
and hit and run Taliban
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
strikes would it not have been easier to
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
utilize those same elligence assets and
 
03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
precision missions for the entirety of
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
the global war on terror the enemy was
 
03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
not a nation state but then again the
 
03:44:19.830 --> 03:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
military-industrial complex can't make
 
03:44:22.710 --> 03:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
money that way Pew research did a study
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
in 2019 that found that only 33% of
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
veterans believe the Iraq War was worth
 
03:44:29.630 --> 03:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
fighting and only 38% believe the
 
03:44:31.710 --> 03:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan war was worth fighting and
 
03:44:33.510 --> 03:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
this study was conducted before the
 
03:44:35.550 --> 03:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
disastrous pull out and the Taliban
 
03:44:37.950 --> 03:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
immediately retaking control I imagine
 
03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
that number is significantly lower
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
I have noticed a generational Gap with
 
03:44:44.149 --> 03:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
regards to anti-war efforts in the
 
03:44:45.950 --> 03:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
veterans community our own State
 
03:44:47.710 --> 03:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee has opposed
 
03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
all three anti-war bills I've
 
03:44:50.990 --> 03:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this turn and this is
 
03:44:53.309 --> 03:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
something I plan on addressing in 2025
 
03:44:55.149 --> 03:44:55.159 align:start position:0%
as there's no way 20 different veteran
 
03:44:57.189 --> 03:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
organiz organizations voting and lock
 
03:44:58.830 --> 03:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
step in favor of the war machine as
 
03:45:00.790 --> 03:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative of the veteran Community
 
03:45:02.670 --> 03:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
as a whole because it discounts the
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
massive growing anti-war veteran
 
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
population out there including
 
03:45:09.910 --> 03:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
myself but setting aside military
 
03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
members I ask a question to the parents
 
03:45:14.149 --> 03:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
out there would you support your child
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
or grandchild dying for microchips in
 
03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
Taiwan or for regime change in
 
03:45:24.830 --> 03:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
Iran or you for Ukraine in any
 
03:45:26.910 --> 03:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
context we have a long history of
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
transparency in the Granite State this
 
03:45:31.149 --> 03:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
bill hopes to give greater context to
 
03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
what teenagers will be enlisting to
 
03:45:34.590 --> 03:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
support the fact that veteran
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
organizations are taking the point in
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
opposition on behalf of the Department
 
03:45:40.590 --> 03:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
of Defense shows was a desire to keep
 
03:45:43.870 --> 03:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
inconvenient facts hidden there was a
 
03:45:45.790 --> 03:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion in my email to add the
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
positives of enlisting but the purpose
 
03:45:49.030 --> 03:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to provide a
 
03:45:51.030 --> 03:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
Counterpoint to the recruiters who are
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
already telling half the story which was
 
03:45:54.990 --> 03:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
an AC
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
accusation this bill's critics are
 
03:46:00.670 --> 03:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
levying at me the belief that there is
 
03:46:02.910 --> 03:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
potential recruit the belief is that if
 
03:46:05.550 --> 03:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
potential recruits get the full picture
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
it would hurt recruiting and that
 
03:46:10.189 --> 03:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
Omission is required to get teenagers to
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
sign up and with that I ask committees
 
03:46:15.990 --> 03:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
to vote OTP on hb1 1246 I want to note
 
03:46:18.269 --> 03:46:18.279 align:start position:0%
there's an error in the bill uh By the
 
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
time OLS got this back it was past the
 
03:46:22.429 --> 03:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
deadline the uh the line about the
 
03:46:23.910 --> 03:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
casualty figures in Afghanistan needs to
 
03:46:26.189 --> 03:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
be corrected that late drafting is also
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
why I was not able to get any
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors but I did have a bunch lined
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
up there's a good group of anti-war
 
03:46:33.389 --> 03:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
people in the State
 
03:46:36.070 --> 03:46:36.080 align:start position:0%

increased there's a extra zero at the
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
end that needs to be stripped off do you

short the information required by this

bias buil that attempts to improve

transparency in military recruiting
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%

indirectly implies that all those who

have served our military veterans have
 
03:50:02.110 --> 03:50:02.120 align:start position:0%

of
 
03:50:08.510 --> 03:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
society the major concern with this bill
 
03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
is its most assur adverse impact of
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
recruiting the information required to
 
03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
be displayed by this bill is less about
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
transparency and more about dissuading
 
03:50:18.750 --> 03:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
men and women from concering military
 
03:50:21.070 --> 03:50:21.080 align:start position:0%

simple I don't dictate where we go and
 
03:53:54.189 --> 03:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
for why we go I'm here to serve the
 
03:53:55.309 --> 03:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state and the citizens
 
03:53:59.070 --> 03:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
less with no other question floor is
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
yours thank you sir thank General my
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
name is Brendan Finn I serve on the
 
03:54:08.510 --> 03:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
state veterans Council and I'm a
 
03:54:10.349 --> 03:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
lieutenant Colonel and the Marine Corps
 
03:54:13.349 --> 03:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
Reserve uh I like the sponsor of this
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
bill I joined shortly after 911 I
 
03:54:18.510 --> 03:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
intended to fight in support of uh the
 
03:54:20.309 --> 03:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
war in Iraq and I ended up in
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan so kind of the opposite of
 
03:54:24.030 --> 03:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
his experience and I'll be speaking from
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
that experience and the experience I had
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
leading Marines and what military
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
service has given them and the benefits
 
03:54:30.990 --> 03:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
that they've received and I'll do my
 
03:54:32.309 --> 03:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
best to stick to that three minute time
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
frame if
 
03:54:36.110 --> 03:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
possible the state veterans Council also
 
03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
opposes House Bill 1247 because the bill
 
03:54:40.750 --> 03:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
would deepen the current military
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
recruiting crisis it would dissuade
 
03:54:44.149 --> 03:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
potential recruits from joining the
 
03:54:46.710 --> 03:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
military expand the civilian military
 
03:54:49.149 --> 03:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
divide and deny recruits that it would
 
03:54:51.910 --> 03:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
dissuade the many benefits of military
 
03:54:54.309 --> 03:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
service at a December 6 Senate armed
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
services Committee hearing Major General
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
Davis Commanding General of Army
 
03:54:59.309 --> 03:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
Recruiting Command said this is one of
 
03:55:01.070 --> 03:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
the toughest recruiting Landscapes I've
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
seen in over 33 years of service he and
 
03:55:06.189 --> 03:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
his counterpart carts of the other uh
 
03:55:07.469 --> 03:55:07.479 align:start position:0%
Services were describing the
 
03:55:09.309 --> 03:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances that led the army my the
 
03:55:12.189 --> 03:55:12.199 align:start position:0%
Navy and the Air Force to all fall short
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
of their recruiting goals in
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
2023 only 12% of potential recruits have
 
03:55:19.389 --> 03:55:19.399 align:start position:0%
a parent who's a veteran as compared to
 
03:55:21.670 --> 03:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
40% in
 
03:55:24.189 --> 03:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
1995 additionally a 2020 defense
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
department study found that
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
77% of 17 to 24 year olds are ineligible
 
03:55:33.229 --> 03:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
for military service due to obesity drug
 
03:55:35.469 --> 03:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
use Andor physical mental health
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
problems if the military continues to
 
03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
miss its recruiting goal s it'll be
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
unable to execute our national defense
 
03:55:43.870 --> 03:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
strategy deter our adversaries and to
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
protect the US in its interest as
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
geopolitics shifts back to bipolarity
 
03:55:51.469 --> 03:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
and the great power competition as China
 
03:55:53.670 --> 03:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
prepares to Annex Taiwan and as Russia
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
and Iran are increasingly belligerent
 
03:56:00.750 --> 03:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:03.389 --> 03:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
Americans regarding the veteran suicide
 
03:56:05.149 --> 03:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
statistic that the bill would require
 
03:56:07.269 --> 03:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
that the state post I think we can all
 
03:56:09.229 --> 03:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
agree that veteran suicide is far too
 
03:56:11.229 --> 03:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
prevalent and that we should all work
 
03:56:13.630 --> 03:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
together to address it I think we can
 
03:56:15.229 --> 03:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
also agree that a fair description of
 
03:56:16.510 --> 03:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
military service should include the
 
03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
leadership comrad ship purpose life
 
03:56:21.550 --> 03:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
skills and federal and state benefits
 
03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
that it provides I've seen the benefits
 
03:56:26.469 --> 03:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
of military service transform the lives
 
03:56:29.790 --> 03:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
of Marines in 2009 I had the honor of
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
and privilege of leading a marine Recon
 
03:56:33.229 --> 03:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
platoon in
 
03:56:35.670 --> 03:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan I challenged one of my three
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
assistant team leaders a sergeant to
 
03:56:39.910 --> 03:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
read his first book during that
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
deployment between operations we took
 
03:56:43.950 --> 03:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
turns reading a book of short stories
 
03:56:46.830 --> 03:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
and we discussed what we read between
 
03:56:49.510 --> 03:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
operations uh we executed what I call a
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
tactical book club and after that
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
deployment he left the service and
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
entered a vocational program and became
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
a successful
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
welder another Marine in that same unit
 
03:57:05.950 --> 03:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
used his post 911 GI bills to attend
 
03:57:08.070 --> 03:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
Texas University or the University of
 
03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
Texas at Austin from which he graduated
 
03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
with 3.9 GPA in three
 
03:57:15.870 --> 03:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
Majors another attended the University
 
03:57:18.750 --> 03:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
of Maryland and completed a Bachelor of
 
03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
Science Program in a cyber security
 
03:57:22.910 --> 03:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
certificate through the GI Bill and he's
 
03:57:25.149 --> 03:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
now a digital forensics expert at a
 
03:57:27.429 --> 03:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
leading Healthcare technology company
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
yet another of that same platoon another
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
Junior Marine completed a mechanical
 
03:57:33.950 --> 03:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
engineering bachelor's degree program at
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
the University of Missouri through the
 
03:57:37.870 --> 03:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
GI program and he's now the CEO of a
 
03:57:41.309 --> 03:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
product design company that he founded
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
every single one of that platoon's
 
03:57:45.550 --> 03:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
senior enlisted Marines will have
 
03:57:47.670 --> 03:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
retired as either a Gunnery Sergeant a
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
chief petty officer a first sergeant a
 
03:57:52.510 --> 03:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
master sergeant and a Master Gunnery
 
03:57:55.229 --> 03:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
Sergeant far from the path to ruin that
 
03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 1247 biased and misleading
 
03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
languager suggest military service for
 
03:58:02.229 --> 03:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
my Marines and sailor enabled their
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
upward socioeconomic mobility and
 
03:58:08.229 --> 03:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
self-actualization House Bill 1247 is
 
03:58:10.349 --> 03:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
titled transparency in military
 
03:58:13.149 --> 03:58:13.159 align:start position:0%
recruiting but it offers far less a
 
03:58:15.229 --> 03:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of military service
 
03:58:17.429 --> 03:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
has a tragic misadventure in pursuit of
 
03:58:19.830 --> 03:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
failed objectives worse the bill would
 
03:58:21.750 --> 03:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
dissuade New Hampshire citizens from
 
03:58:24.269 --> 03:58:24.279 align:start position:0%
serving exactly when the US military
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
most needs our help in finding the men
 
03:58:28.269 --> 03:58:28.279 align:start position:0%
and women who will keep our nation safe
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
and free it would deepen the civilian
 
03:58:33.469 --> 03:58:33.479 align:start position:0%
military divide already far too many
 
03:58:35.309 --> 03:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
citizens think of those who served in
 
03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
the military as broken instead of as
 
03:58:40.469 --> 03:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
assets and their Community House Bill
 
03:58:42.670 --> 03:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
1247 is biased and misleading language
 
03:58:44.309 --> 03:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
would support their erroneous and
 
03:58:47.309 --> 03:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
harmful preconceived notions New
 
03:58:48.510 --> 03:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens have always
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
volunteered to serve our country which
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
has benefited them their communities and
 
03:58:55.550 --> 03:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
our nation please ensure they always
 
03:58:58.030 --> 03:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
will by finding House Bill 1247
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank
 
03:59:03.149 --> 03:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions from the
 
03:59:06.269 --> 03:59:06.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative sers uh thank
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and uh thank thank you for
 
03:59:11.550 --> 03:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I also served in
 
03:59:14.349 --> 03:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
the in the military and I appreciate the
 
03:59:17.630 --> 03:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
GI bill and I used it and look at me now
 
03:59:21.550 --> 03:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:24.630 --> 03:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
year so you said two couple key words
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
you picked I want to pick up on is you
 
03:59:31.149 --> 03:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
said miscellany language and also Mis uh
 
03:59:32.830 --> 03:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation and that's why I'm
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
getting back to I want to make sure this
 
03:59:38.149 --> 03:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
is truth and that's why I'm asking and I
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
ask Major
 
03:59:42.510 --> 03:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
General and are there really any
 
03:59:45.389 --> 03:59:45.399 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies here that are are misstated
 
03:59:47.710 --> 03:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
are really exactly what you said in
 
03:59:50.149 --> 03:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
those two things misleading or
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation well I think that you
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
can hold up a you could cover half a
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
portrait and say is this the portrait
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
and the answer is well it's half of it
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
that's accurate information except for
 
04:00:02.309 --> 04:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
the Casual statistics in Afghanistan
 
04:00:04.830 --> 04:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
which I just learned about however I
 
04:00:06.910 --> 04:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
think that it does not in any way
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
describe the whole now the sponsor of
 
04:00:10.429 --> 04:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
this bill mentioned that he assumes that
 
04:00:12.429 --> 04:00:12.439 align:start position:0%
recruiters are giving the second half of
 
04:00:14.670 --> 04:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
that picture but that's an assumption
 
04:00:16.710 --> 04:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
some recruiters may be some may not some
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
may be giving the full picture and then
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
the negatives are being reemphasized by
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
this bill's language so I think it would
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
be much better for the state to put
 
04:00:25.469 --> 04:00:25.479 align:start position:0%
itself in a position of providing a
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
holistic view of military service rather
 
04:00:29.710 --> 04:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
than just
 
04:00:33.670 --> 04:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
half yep followup thank you Mr chair
 
04:00:36.189 --> 04:00:36.199 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful uh to give a better
 
04:00:38.349 --> 04:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
representation by saying during these
 
04:00:42.790 --> 04:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
these years we also had you know uh
 
04:00:46.349 --> 04:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
680,000 people sign up to serve with
 
04:00:50.870 --> 04:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
that help in balancing the
 
04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
numbers I think the more information the
 
04:00:55.830 --> 04:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
better I think that this one this the
 
04:00:58.389 --> 04:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
current draft of the bill provides a
 
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
very misleading picture and if we can
 
04:01:04.349 --> 04:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
only improve upon it um I think that if
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
you were to look at the experience of my
 
04:01:08.429 --> 04:01:08.439 align:start position:0%
Marines who were in Afghanistan fighting
 
04:01:10.590 --> 04:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
that war that the sponsor of this bill
 
04:01:12.870 --> 04:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
deemed a failure they would look back on
 
04:01:16.269 --> 04:01:16.279 align:start position:0%
our entire experience as positive and
 
04:01:18.189 --> 04:01:18.199 align:start position:0%
our experiences which I do not think our
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
misrepresentative or are uh misleading
 
04:01:24.189 --> 04:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
sample would suggest that there are a
 
04:01:25.870 --> 04:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
great deal of benefits to serving the
 
04:01:28.269 --> 04:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
military even in pursuit of objectives
 
04:01:30.910 --> 04:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
that um one person might deem to be
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:37.269 --> 04:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
failed just for my own S I do want to
 
04:01:39.110 --> 04:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
make sure every I made a lot of money
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
during the years from that GI bill so
 
04:01:41.359 --> 04:01:43.630 align:start position:0%
during the years from that GI bill so
follow

04:01:43.630 --> 04:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:46.149 --> 04:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
up uh any other questions from the
 
04:01:48.269 --> 04:01:48.279 align:start position:0%
committee seeing nothing thank you both
 
04:01:51.269 --> 04:01:51.279 align:start position:0%

you uh next up chair recognizes Brooks
 
04:01:56.550 --> 04:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
Hayward uh New Hampshire National Guard

afternoon

04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:14.469 --> 04:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
sir next up chair recognize
 
04:02:22.469 --> 04:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
that James Adams uh not saying who it
 
04:02:25.630 --> 04:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
represents also opposed to the
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
ient yeah hold on if I can yeah we have
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
microphones nowadays if I can get you to
 
04:02:37.590 --> 04:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and uh start my name
 
04:02:38.750 --> 04:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
is Jim Adam
 
04:02:40.189 --> 04:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
I'm the chairman of the state veterans
 
04:02:42.630 --> 04:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
Council and there's very little I can
 
04:02:46.590 --> 04:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
add to what the general and Brendon gave
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
you for information I
 
04:02:51.830 --> 04:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
think the biggest concern that we have
 
04:02:55.670 --> 04:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
is is Brendan may this is one man's
 
04:02:58.950 --> 04:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
opinion and he's put in all
 
04:03:02.910 --> 04:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
negative items to represent his opinion
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
and in a world
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
where right now we've got two active
 
04:03:12.590 --> 04:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
shooting Wars to say we're uh almost in
 
04:03:15.309 --> 04:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
1939 all over again might not be too
 
04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
much of an exaggeration but the bottom
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
line is is the last thing we need is not
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
being able to get
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
volunteers and with the complete
 
04:03:26.550 --> 04:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
volunteer service something like this
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:03:31.710 --> 04:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
far um it would just be too much for us
 
04:03:33.710 --> 04:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
to overcome not overcome but it's it's
 
04:03:35.790 --> 04:03:35.800 align:start position:0%
just very very poor and I I really
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
believe that and and uh I went through
 
04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
my some of my readings and by the way I
 
04:03:43.110 --> 04:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
am a Vietnam
 
04:03:45.790 --> 04:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
veteran and when we came home we got a
 
04:03:49.229 --> 04:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
pretty rough welcome but some of that
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
was deserved because it was a very uh
 
04:03:55.149 --> 04:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
very poorly thought out event over there
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
but the veterans that I serve or and I'm
 
04:04:01.110 --> 04:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
in the chapter 41 here in conquer of the
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
Vietnam Veterans of America it's amazing
 
04:04:06.070 --> 04:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
that all we went through coming home and
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
all we went through over there that a
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
full 90% of those veterans are proud of
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
what they did they've did what their
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
country asked and they fought for their
 
04:04:22.990 --> 04:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
country and amazingly old fuds like me
 
04:04:25.910 --> 04:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
66% of them if they're called are ready
 
04:04:28.110 --> 04:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
to go tomorrow now we know that won't
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
happen but I believe that that the state
 
04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
veterans Council and so many of the
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
other organizations here New Hampshire's
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
veterans community is one of the most
 
04:04:39.550 --> 04:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
outstanding in the country country and
 
04:04:41.550 --> 04:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
the words I I remember from Ronald
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
Reagan for the Fallen not to be
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
forgotten we must be their voice and the
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
veterans voice in New Hampshire is
 
04:04:54.990 --> 04:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
outstanding and loud and it is very much
 
04:04:58.110 --> 04:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
against this bill we don't this is the
 
04:05:00.189 --> 04:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
time we need to start pulling together
 
04:05:01.790 --> 04:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
not to start to point out that
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's got a a hole in their sock so
 
04:05:07.630 --> 04:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time thank
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
you very much any questions from the
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
committee I see one if you'll take it
 
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
V I'm
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
very uh downtrodden I guess I don't know
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
very depressed by this this bill in a
 
04:05:24.750 --> 04:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
lot of ways because almost every
 
04:05:28.389 --> 04:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
conflict since in US history has had
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
people questioning the motivation behind
 
04:05:32.189 --> 04:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
it has always been a question of you
 
04:05:34.990 --> 04:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
know going even world two world wars is
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
it is it fair to for the state to step
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
in and and try to tip the scale in one
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
way or the other on on opinions of how
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
these these conflicts were handled
 
04:05:46.710 --> 04:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
whether they were VI valid reasons or
 
04:05:49.309 --> 04:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
whether we R Li to is it is it possible
 
04:05:51.429 --> 04:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
that there you know I guess that would
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
be a followup but I won't do that but is
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
it fair to do this from the state level
 
04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:06:01.389 --> 04:06:01.399 align:start position:0%
context I believe that your spot on this
 
04:06:04.110 --> 04:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
is not an issue for the state to decide
 
04:06:06.510 --> 04:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
did we win lose or draw is it one one
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
and one in our last three
 
04:06:12.510 --> 04:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
Wars exactly this is this is I in my
 
04:06:14.349 --> 04:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
humble belief people will make up their
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
minds but I I think I'd like to leave
 
04:06:18.830 --> 04:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
you with the fact that that I've had the
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
privilege of of working with and being
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
with veterans all of my life and most of
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
them say after it was the best job they
 
04:06:29.790 --> 04:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
ever had and every one of those men and
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
women realized that when they sign up
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
they sign a blank check leading up to an
 
04:06:38.590 --> 04:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
including giving their lives
 
04:06:41.870 --> 04:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
for what we have today that's an
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
outstanding country and my opinion in
 
04:06:48.349 --> 04:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
this state has always been there to go
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
forward follow yeah I I just want to
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
make sure I thank you for your service
 
04:06:55.229 --> 04:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
and thank all the veterans who you know
 
04:06:56.429 --> 04:06:56.439 align:start position:0%

service for their country at the request
 
04:07:01.349 --> 04:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
of their country and and you
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
know I understand the history of the
 
04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
United States I understand how they can
 
04:07:06.030 --> 04:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
be conflicts and I appreciate it I just
 
04:07:07.469 --> 04:07:07.479 align:start position:0%

04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
when we had our meeting on it on the 2nd
 
04:07:58.830 --> 04:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
of January uh we just made a motion to
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
oppose and it was unanimous across the
 
04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
board uh to oppose the bill since the
 
04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
representative brought it up I don't
 
04:08:07.870 --> 04:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
want to leave you with the int with the
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
idea that we on the state veterans
 
04:08:12.030 --> 04:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
advisory committee are a bunch of old
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
school Lackey of the military industrial
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
complex okay uh the three bills that he
 
04:08:21.870 --> 04:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
individually sponsored that we oppose
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
that he's upset about are number one
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
229 and that and this bill and the other
 
04:08:31.109 --> 04:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
Bill to some degree we have the same
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
complaint with all of them and the same
 
04:08:36.510 --> 04:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
complaint is Schoolhouse Rock okay
 
04:08:39.109 --> 04:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
Schoolhouse Rock supremacy clause of the
 
04:08:41.070 --> 04:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution okay when you have a
 
04:08:43.830 --> 04:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
federal law you can't make a state law
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
that that conflicts with the federal law
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
you can't do it it says so right in
 
04:08:49.269 --> 04:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
Schoolhouse Rock I learned that when I
 
04:08:53.070 --> 04:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
was I was younger okay so House Bill 229
 
04:08:56.109 --> 04:08:56.119 align:start position:0%
on not deploying the guard in case uh
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
unless there's a declaration of war it
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of what's written in
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
plain black and white in English in
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
title 10 of US law and that's why we
 
04:09:06.030 --> 04:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
oppose it you know the reason why is
 
04:09:08.830 --> 04:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
because in the military we're rule
 
04:09:11.790 --> 04:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
followers when you make a rule we tend
 
04:09:14.429 --> 04:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
to follow it okay the other two this
 
04:09:17.349 --> 04:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
this session House Bill
 
04:09:20.429 --> 04:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
1338 which was sort of attacking and
 
04:09:22.109 --> 04:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
deciding we weren't going to do anything
 
04:09:26.510 --> 04:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
with the Selective Service um is again
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
misplaced if you want to get rid of The
 
04:09:31.269 --> 04:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
Selective Service and let's be honest we
 
04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
haven't drafted anybody in this country
 
04:09:35.429 --> 04:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
since I was a sophomore at the Air Force
 
04:09:37.870 --> 04:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
Academy a long time ago in a galaxy Far
 
04:09:39.870 --> 04:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
Far Away more than 50 years since we've
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
drafted anybody in our country if you
 
04:09:44.670 --> 04:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
want to do that the way to do that is we
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
ask our Congressional Delegation to
 
04:09:49.229 --> 04:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
introduce legislation in Washington DC
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
and either say selective service is
 
04:09:53.910 --> 04:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
something whose time is come and gone or
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
we decide to make it Equitable say if
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to require our young men to
 
04:09:59.189 --> 04:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
register we should require our young
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
ladies to register too so you can do one
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
of those two things what you can't do is
 
04:10:05.950 --> 04:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
pass a law at the state level that says
 
04:10:07.469 --> 04:10:07.479 align:start position:0%
we're just going to Gap up with the
 
04:10:10.830 --> 04:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
federal laws are and that has been our
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
objection to those two bills and this
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
one okay this bill is is in your
 
04:10:18.790 --> 04:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
committee primarily because the
 
04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
Selective Service piece of this thing uh
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
asked that they put this information
 
04:10:25.710 --> 04:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
available in uh the where the driver's
 
04:10:28.269 --> 04:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
license bureaus are in the DMV that's
 
04:10:30.030 --> 04:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
why you're hearing this bill as opposed
 
04:10:33.109 --> 04:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
to state federal relations in military
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
Affairs for
 
04:10:37.630 --> 04:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
example so that those are the reasons
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
why primarily we oppose this you've
 
04:10:42.309 --> 04:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about military recruiting
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I just want to leave you with this
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
thought about military recruiting we're
 
04:10:47.710 --> 04:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
all competing out there for the best
 
04:10:50.349 --> 04:10:50.359 align:start position:0%
talent available on the civilian side on
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
the military side we're dealing with
 
04:10:54.389 --> 04:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
historically low unemployment in the
 
04:10:55.990 --> 04:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I'm not telling
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
any of you anything that you don't
 
04:11:00.189 --> 04:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
already know on that and because the old
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
school teacher and me always likes to
 
04:11:04.510 --> 04:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
cite his sources okay I'm going to cite
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
this Source it's not my opinion it's the
 
04:11:09.109 --> 04:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
opinion of chief Master Sergeant of the
 
04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
Air Force Joanne bass my wife and I
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
watched a a fireside chat with uh the uh
 
04:11:18.030 --> 04:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
president of the Air Force Association
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
uh and her and she's a very sharp person
 
04:11:22.590 --> 04:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
I I highly recommend you you look into
 
04:11:25.750 --> 04:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
her but what she said was 10 years
 
04:11:25.760 --> 04:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
her but what she said was 10 years
ago

04:11:27.750 --> 04:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
Walmart Dunkin
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
Donuts for their people that are not
 
04:11:35.149 --> 04:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
hourly help there was no such thing as a
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
benefits package now they all have a
 
04:11:39.389 --> 04:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
benefit benefits package okay we have
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
benefits in the military but paying
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
allowances there's not much we can do
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
about that except at the federal level
 
04:11:49.510 --> 04:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
so you know it when you write a bill
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
like this that that it just makes the
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
the job of these folks who have already
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
talked to you about that harder uh to do
 
04:11:58.189 --> 04:11:58.199 align:start position:0%

04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
somebody's coming toward me sometime and
 
04:16:34.269 --> 04:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
I and I'm they're
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
smoking and when I go past them and so
 
04:16:39.550 --> 04:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
forth I can smell the smoke in the air
 
04:16:42.229 --> 04:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
all the way 50 feet behind them so forth
 
04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
so it's persistent and it's not not only
 
04:16:47.590 --> 04:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
an irritation I'm sure as many of you
 
04:16:51.469 --> 04:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
know it's also a tremendous Health uh
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
Hazard um and when it's concentrated in
 
04:16:55.760 --> 04:16:56.790 align:start position:0%
Hazard um and when it's concentrated in
a

04:16:56.790 --> 04:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh perhaps in a time when the
 
04:17:03.630 --> 04:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
windows can't be opened uh and their
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
children present it's more than an
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
irritation but are captives in that
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
vehicle we require them to be belted in
 
04:17:16.590 --> 04:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh at you certain ages um and if they're
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
in that vehicle they are being subjected
 
04:17:23.469 --> 04:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
to a a a toxic element which is very
 
04:17:26.910 --> 04:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
deleterious to their health um so I've
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
long believed that uh that smoking in
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles should be prohibited uh for the
 
04:17:34.349 --> 04:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
same reason that that we don't let
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
children uh you know
 
04:17:40.229 --> 04:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
sit unb belted because in case of an
 
04:17:42.550 --> 04:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
accident they're a tremendous Hazard
 
04:17:47.710 --> 04:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
with small bodies in many cases um so uh
 
04:17:49.269 --> 04:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
and this bill has been before this
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh several times and and it's
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
also been favorably uh reviewed by this
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
committee and I think several times it's
 
04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
been uh passed with an or reported out
 
04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
with an autop pass or sometimes
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
otpa um so I'm not going to the major
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh for this bill here today
 
04:18:13.149 --> 04:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
because uh there's several young people
 
04:18:15.870 --> 04:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
here behind me from the do youth to
 
04:18:15.880 --> 04:18:17.030 align:start position:0%
here behind me from the do youth to
Youth

04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
Youth
 
04:18:19.030 --> 04:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
Organization uh which I've been a
 
04:18:21.389 --> 04:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
longtime fan of because it's an
 
04:18:24.269 --> 04:18:24.279 align:start position:0%
excellent training for young people to
 
04:18:27.510 --> 04:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
advocate for issues and they frequently
 
04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor bills couple of times they've
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
sponsored this co-sponsored this bill or
 
04:18:36.269 --> 04:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
supported this bill for me uh but also
 
04:18:39.269 --> 04:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
in another cases and uh they're the ones
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
that are most at risk um because if you
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
have a child in a in a vehicle and there
 
04:18:49.710 --> 04:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
the adult is at the wheel smoking or
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
maybe sitting in a passenger seat kids
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
are they're stuck for the duration of
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
that trip in that car so uh I'll answer
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
a question or two if you have any but I
 
04:19:04.030 --> 04:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
really want you to listen to the young
 
04:19:07.389 --> 04:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
people from Dover uh whove come to speak
 
04:19:10.990 --> 04:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
today to speak to you today so with that
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
I'll end my testimony except try to
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
answer any of the questions you may
 
04:19:18.590 --> 04:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative St Clair
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you um do you
 
04:19:23.790 --> 04:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
have a number of is there a number of
 
04:19:26.070 --> 04:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
states that already have a law like this
 
04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh on the
 
04:19:30.030 --> 04:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
books I I haven't even investigated
 
04:19:32.550 --> 04:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
because I represent New Hampshire this
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
is the only state that I have any
 
04:19:37.630 --> 04:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
influence on although I you you know I I
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
could I have relatives in a bunch of the
 
04:19:44.830 --> 04:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
Midwest states I came from 45 years ago
 
04:19:47.710 --> 04:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
um but uh I have no idea whe it's even
 
04:19:49.389 --> 04:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
been brought forward in other in other
 
04:19:51.670 --> 04:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
states all right thank
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
committee let's start with somebody new
 
04:19:57.279 --> 04:20:00.990 align:start position:0%
committee let's start with somebody new
representative

04:20:00.990 --> 04:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.109 --> 04:20:03.119 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair I thought
 
04:20:06.030 --> 04:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
you're gonna surely pick somebody else
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm going back 55 years 60 years even
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
and my parents smoked in the vehicles we
 
04:20:15.109 --> 04:20:15.119 align:start position:0%
had station wagons the back window
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
opened up we've breathed all this stuff
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
in and I'm not saying I'm proud of it
 
04:20:22.870 --> 04:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm saying it might cause harm but
 
04:20:26.830 --> 04:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's not necessarily deadly and and
 
04:20:28.910 --> 04:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
and my point
 
04:20:32.830 --> 04:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
is you're G to force everybody that
 
04:20:35.149 --> 04:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
smokes just because they have a child in
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
the car they're going to be you're
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
telling them that they can't smoke at if
 
04:20:42.030 --> 04:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
the kids are under 16 that's that's what
 
04:20:44.229 --> 04:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
you're telling them that's what you want
 
04:20:46.109 --> 04:20:46.119 align:start position:0%
that is what I want
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes I think that was a question uh
 
04:20:48.960 --> 04:20:51.550 align:start position:0%
yes I think that was a question uh
representative

04:20:51.550 --> 04:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you um just for my
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
information is flavored vaping
 
04:20:58.590 --> 04:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
considered ecigarette are they is that
 
04:21:00.189 --> 04:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
under the same category is there
 
04:21:02.070 --> 04:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
anything so
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
yeah represent
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
pondon thank you um representative i f
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
may ask how do you envision uh
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement on on this issue uh as an
 
04:21:16.750 --> 04:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
example would this give police the the
 
04:21:19.229 --> 04:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to pull a vehicle over if
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
they see someone smoking and assume
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
there's a a juvenile in the in the
 
04:21:26.550 --> 04:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle and also next part of my
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
question would be um how will we ID the
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
juvenile as well just some looking for
 
04:21:32.479 --> 04:21:33.670 align:start position:0%
juvenile as well just some looking for
some

04:21:33.670 --> 04:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts well uh the way I usually
 
04:21:40.269 --> 04:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
recognize identified juveniles is by
 
04:21:45.670 --> 04:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
looking at them because uh whereas a 16
 
04:21:51.309 --> 04:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
or 17y old can uh look like an adult um
 
04:21:54.910 --> 04:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
the uh obviously young children are very
 
04:21:57.750 --> 04:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
obviously children uh they don't they
 
04:22:00.630 --> 04:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
don't have any IDs but the the Bill
 
04:22:06.109 --> 04:22:06.119 align:start position:0%
calls for uh for if people are under 16
 
04:22:09.389 --> 04:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
and some 16y olds are pretty good size
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
and and pretty adultlooking um but uh
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the the bottom line here is the first
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
part of your question which is can a
 
04:22:22.710 --> 04:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
police officer pull a vehicle over and
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at the second part of the
 
04:22:26.349 --> 04:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
bill you see that it says it's a
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
secondary offense so it can't stop the
 
04:22:33.670 --> 04:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle for uh for smoking only but
 
04:22:36.429 --> 04:22:36.439 align:start position:0%
rather uh if if they're being stopped
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
for something else and the police
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
officer observes that there are children
 
04:22:44.109 --> 04:22:44.119 align:start position:0%
present and smoking going on then as a
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
secondary offense he can uh he can site
 
04:22:52.750 --> 04:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:55.229 --> 04:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
instance not seeing any other questions
 
04:22:56.950 --> 04:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much

child or and smoker are in a confined
 
04:24:06.510 --> 04:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
space such as a vehicle the closed
 
04:24:08.269 --> 04:24:08.279 align:start position:0%

notably more harmful
 
04:24:18.429 --> 04:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
way so as we said earlier one of our
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
biggest concerns is the health concerns
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
of secondhand smoke which is also known
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
as environmental tobacco smoke
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
secondhand smoke can affect natural
 
04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
development of kids lungs and can cause
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
long-term if not permanent damage
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
tobacco smoke contains over 4,000
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
chemicals at least 96 of which can cause
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
different kinds of cancer including lung
 
04:24:45.000 --> 04:24:46.510 align:start position:0%

04:24:54.990 --> 04:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
Leukemia secondhand smoke is also linked
 
04:24:57.109 --> 04:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
to various diseases and illnesses such
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
as asthma and lower respiratory tract
 
04:25:03.389 --> 04:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
infections almost 1 million asmatic kids
 
04:25:05.550 --> 04:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
in the US suffer from increased problems
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
due to secondhand smoke exposure the EPA
 
04:25:10.750 --> 04:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
states that secondhand smoke increases
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
the number of asthma attacks and
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
severity of asthma related
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
issues we would additionally like to
 
04:25:18.030 --> 04:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
address the belief that rolling down the
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
window will prevent harm to people in
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
the vehicle opening a window reduces the
 
04:25:24.670 --> 04:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
harm but does not eliminate it
 
04:25:26.670 --> 04:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
sufficiently according to the American
 
04:25:28.910 --> 04:25:28.920 align:start position:0%

04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
higher than what the EPA considers
 
04:25:40.349 --> 04:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
hazardous even when a window is
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
down in 2006 a study was conducted by
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
the Harvard School of Public Health
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
meant to measure the toxicity of
 
04:25:51.109 --> 04:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
secondhand smoking cars researchers
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
found that even with the driver's

04:25:58.229 --> 04:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
open the amount of secondhand smoke in
 
04:26:01.389 --> 04:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
the car is approximately seven times
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
higher than the epa's Hazardous level
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
according to the EP air is considered
 
04:26:09.870 --> 04:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
unhealthy with sensitive groups such as
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
children and elderly when secondhand
 
04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
smoke concentrations are about 40
 
04:26:17.870 --> 04:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
microgram per cubic meter in the study
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the air reached a level of 272
 
04:26:25.630 --> 04:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
micrograms and a peak of 5505 micrograms
 
04:26:28.590 --> 04:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
per cubic meter these results show that
 
04:26:30.149 --> 04:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
smoking in the car can result in
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
extremely harmful levels of secondhand
 
04:26:35.109 --> 04:26:35.119 align:start position:0%

04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:40.349 --> 04:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
now we also have concerns surrounding
 
04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
the Lesser known issue of thirdhand
 
04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:45.399 align:start position:0%

materials such as curtains these
 
04:26:57.429 --> 04:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
chemicals can then be picked up by kids
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
as they touch surfaces and put their

extending beyond the issue of just
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
traditional cigarettes we also want to
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%

research done on Vapes and ecigarettes
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%

specifically targeting parents we don't

defenseless and strapped into a car seat
 
04:28:55.630 --> 04:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
take a moment to imagine a 2-year-old

strapped into their car seat in the back
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
of their brother's car the brother pulls

out a cigarette and starts smoking the

life you can make a statement by passing
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
this bill we believe that the Youth of
 
04:29:27.750 --> 04:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our age and especially
 
04:29:29.590 --> 04:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
younger should have the freedom to live
 
04:29:32.830 --> 04:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
a healthy life with all this being said
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
we strongly encourage you to vote in
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
favor of house bill till
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
12:44 thank you for your time and we
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
04:29:48.990 --> 04:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:29:55.389 --> 04:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
dumes how was this bill
 
04:29:58.189 --> 04:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
enforcable so uh thank you so much for
 
04:30:01.510 --> 04:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
your question uh so in New Hampshire we
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
actually have a lot about um cell phone
 
04:30:06.630 --> 04:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
usage and texting driving uh you're not
 
04:30:08.590 --> 04:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that in New Hampshire and
 
04:30:10.750 --> 04:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
I think it would be very uh along
 
04:30:15.109 --> 04:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
similar lines as to that um I you see
 
04:30:16.630 --> 04:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
people on their phones that would be a
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
thing where police officers would be
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
able to pull them over uh I think it was
 
04:30:22.510 --> 04:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier where they talked
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
about you can clearly visibly tell when
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
a child is a child um and I think it
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be similar guidelines under that
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
agree representative St Clair did you
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
still have your hand up I do thank you
 
04:30:42.109 --> 04:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
um I be I just would like to know do you
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
have hear from a lot of your friends uh
 
04:30:49.750 --> 04:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
ever complaining about their parents
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
doing this or uh you know smoking while
 
04:30:54.510 --> 04:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
you're in the car your friends are in
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
the car or uh even other adults and then
 
04:30:59.309 --> 04:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
I have a
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
followup uh yes I I know people whose
 
04:31:05.229 --> 04:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
parents smoke in the car and I think
 
04:31:09.149 --> 04:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
many people our age um the school that
 
04:31:11.630 --> 04:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
we attend they've taken out a lot of the
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
presentations on drug misuse because
 
04:31:15.189 --> 04:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
they're like oh we cover it in health
 
04:31:18.349 --> 04:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
class but they really don't so I think
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
that the youth in New Hampshire are
 
04:31:23.309 --> 04:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
relatively uneducated on this topic and
 
04:31:26.469 --> 04:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
therefore are unaware of all the co
 
04:31:28.109 --> 04:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
conditions and diseases that could be
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
caused by this exposure and I think it's
 
04:31:33.550 --> 04:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
important to one educate them and two
 
04:31:35.790 --> 04:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
help protect them from these potential
 
04:31:35.800 --> 04:31:37.189 align:start position:0%
help protect them from these potential
dangerous

04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
choices follow up yep follow up thank
 
04:31:39.920 --> 04:31:41.149 align:start position:0%
choices follow up yep follow up thank

um the student on the on on my left
 
04:31:49.030 --> 04:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
there uh she read you read a number of
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
states that have a similar law and you I
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
was trying to count and I couldn't but
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
could you just give me the total number
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
on that I believe it's
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
eight eight eight okay thank you oh you
 
04:32:05.830 --> 04:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
have the testim and then I would also
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
like to address rep sell's comment um
 
04:32:11.229 --> 04:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm incorrect earlier
 
04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
you said that uh you grew up and with
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
secondhand smoke and you aren't
 
04:32:19.349 --> 04:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily saying that smoking is not
 
04:32:21.469 --> 04:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
bad that was not your statement but more
 
04:32:23.950 --> 04:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
so that people aren't dying due to
 
04:32:26.910 --> 04:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
secondhand smoke is that
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
correct uh yeah that's that's not how
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
this works you don't I just wanted to
 
04:32:34.109 --> 04:32:34.119 align:start position:0%
you're not he's not your witness I just
 
04:32:35.790 --> 04:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to I didn't want to miss I didn't
 
04:32:37.630 --> 04:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
want to misspeak on what he was saying
 
04:32:39.870 --> 04:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
because I did want to make an additional
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
comment that I didn't make earlier again
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
we try not to get back and force of
 
04:32:46.870 --> 04:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
course no I would never do that um but I
 
04:32:49.349 --> 04:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
I did want to point out that this is a
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
big issue that we have um I know Eleanor
 
04:32:56.349 --> 04:32:56.359 align:start position:0%
and Megan are members of the do you
 
04:32:58.349 --> 04:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
youth as well as I am but they are they
 
04:32:59.950 --> 04:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
are currently attending over middle
 
04:33:03.229 --> 04:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
school and I attend over High School uh
 
04:33:05.109 --> 04:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
and I remember so many of my friends
 
04:33:07.949 --> 04:33:07.959 align:start position:0%
parents and struggling uh with smoking
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
and I remember so many many of my
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
friends were made fun of for having
 
04:33:14.670 --> 04:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
clothes with that smelled like smoke and
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
things like that and being ridiculed
 
04:33:18.189 --> 04:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
because of that uh which is truly just
 
04:33:20.670 --> 04:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking it's hard enough being in
 
04:33:22.990 --> 04:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
high school and being in Middle School
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
figuring out who you are and then having
 
04:33:26.910 --> 04:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
another thing to be made fun of um but I
 
04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
would like to acknowledge that since
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
1964 2 and a half million people have
 
04:33:34.830 --> 04:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
died due to health related issues with
 
04:33:37.629 --> 04:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
secondhand smoke uh and many of those
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
people are people's parents siblings
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
brothers sisters and I think that's
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
important to
 
04:33:44.709 --> 04:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
know any further questions from the
 
04:33:47.629 --> 04:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
committee representative Gorski thank
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman first of all I want to
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
acknowledge you all you three for for
 
04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
doing this I think it's fantastic having
 
04:33:56.109 --> 04:33:56.119 align:start position:0%
the youth coming in and and talking at a
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill so I want to congratulate you all
 
04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
for doing this my question
 
04:34:03.310 --> 04:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
is I have friends who are
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
smokers what would you say to them
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
when they say here I have a
 
04:34:12.429 --> 04:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
car and if we pass this bill what would
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
you say to them in which they say you're
 
04:34:17.109 --> 04:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
infringing on my right to be able to
 
04:34:20.670 --> 04:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
drive my car and smoke my cigarette what
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
would you say to those people well first
 
04:34:26.230 --> 04:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
we I just like to address that we don't
 
04:34:28.189 --> 04:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
we're not attacking people who smoke
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
here we are attacking the industry and
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
their deliberate deception that is done
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
just to make money because tobacco
 
04:34:37.230 --> 04:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
nicotine in any form is not good for
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
anybody but we would probably say to
 
04:34:42.910 --> 04:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
them that we're not infringing on their
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
right to smoke in a vehicle at all times
 
04:34:47.070 --> 04:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
we want to protect the Youth of New
 
04:34:49.590 --> 04:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and protect them from all the
 
04:34:52.109 --> 04:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
dangers that can be caused by by these
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:03.990 --> 04:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%

04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%

04:35:34.199 --> 04:35:50.029 align:start position:0%
 
1467

04:35:50.029 --> 04:35:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.119 --> 04:36:34.510 align:start position:0%

04:36:34.520 --> 04:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
course

04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.000 --> 04:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
different

04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:34.000 --> 04:37:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
Wonder

04:37:40.629 --> 04:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
up

04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back I'm G to open up the
 
04:38:35.390 --> 04:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 1467
 
04:38:38.750 --> 04:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
relative to child passenger protection I
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
did get an email from the prime sponsor
 
04:38:41.869 --> 04:38:41.879 align:start position:0%
who cannot make it today but
 
04:38:44.109 --> 04:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan has been kind
 
04:38:47.070 --> 04:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
enough to fill in for her welcome
 
04:38:47.080 --> 04:38:56.029 align:start position:0%
enough to fill in for her welcome
representative

04:38:56.029 --> 04:38:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
Oregon I won't be able to I mean nobody
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
can replace representative Gibbons he
 
04:39:03.551 --> 04:39:03.561 align:start position:0%
would have been a what stronger
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
spokesman than I'll be but I'll I'll do
 
04:39:06.750 --> 04:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
my best to introduce the bill so my name
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
is represent Timothy Horan from straford
 
04:39:11.470 --> 04:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
County District 10 which is the town
 
04:39:15.310 --> 04:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
town of Durham and I'm uh here B to very
 
04:39:19.150 --> 04:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh quickly introduce hb1 1467 relative
 
04:39:21.629 --> 04:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
to child passenger protection so it
 
04:39:25.590 --> 04:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
upgrades the basically the uh the seat
 
04:39:28.029 --> 04:39:28.039 align:start position:0%
belt laws as a regard to persons under
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
18 so persons over 18 are still uh free
 
04:39:34.510 --> 04:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
to drive without their seat belts on um
 
04:39:37.550 --> 04:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's a topic for for
 
04:39:38.910 --> 04:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
another bill it
 
04:39:41.110 --> 04:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
would if we had a hearing on that it
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
would probably be in rep's hall or at
 
04:39:44.070 --> 04:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
least down the hall at the big Finance
 
04:39:46.030 --> 04:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
room rather than in this little half
 
04:39:47.670 --> 04:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
room so
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
um and um even if she had been and most
 
04:39:55.390 --> 04:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
is a most was fairly self-explanatory
 
04:39:56.550 --> 04:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh one thing was a topic that's been in
 
04:40:02.310 --> 04:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
my my mind was this addresses that isn't
 
04:40:03.948 --> 04:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
listed at all in the existing laws the
 
04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
issue of older vehicles which so are so
 
04:40:10.270 --> 04:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
old they weren't um equipped with seat
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
belts and I happen to have a friend who
 
04:40:14.030 --> 04:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
died this summer actually I didn't
 
04:40:15.910 --> 04:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
really know him that well his sister
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
mostly the brother of a friend of mine
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
who died uh tragically because he was
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
driving down I think route 106 in Wolf
 
04:40:26.110 --> 04:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
Barrow a minor routine traffic acent
 
04:40:27.628 --> 04:40:27.638 align:start position:0%
turned into tragedy because he was not
 
04:40:29.628 --> 04:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
wearing a seat belt because after lar
 
04:40:31.590 --> 04:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have one and
 
04:40:34.510 --> 04:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
um there could be legislation to clarify
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
that of the law but that this that that
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
this only applies uh to people who are
 
04:40:42.750 --> 04:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
under 18 who are riding in vehicles
 
04:40:44.670 --> 04:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
including those with seat belts and
 
04:40:47.628 --> 04:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
those without and it makes
 
04:40:50.150 --> 04:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
um it I guess it's less Sweeping in the
 
04:40:52.110 --> 04:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
past bill we had a past build that be
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
three years ago became very very
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
controversial it's about rear-facing
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
child seats so it does keep it does
 
04:40:59.910 --> 04:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
mandate rear facing child seats
 
04:41:01.948 --> 04:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
basically for children less than 2 years
 
04:41:04.868 --> 04:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
old and uh weighing less than 30 PBS and
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
he can also use a rear facing child seat
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
for an older child uh who's under four
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
and weighing less than than 40 lb and
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
then there's other restrictions uh N I
 
04:41:17.788 --> 04:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
suppose some adults are shorter than 4
 
04:41:21.628 --> 04:41:21.638 align:start position:0%
foot n but um then they uh they can
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
still be in a uh child restraint system
 
04:41:26.230 --> 04:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
unless they're big enough and then they
 
04:41:29.390 --> 04:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
can unless they can um then then if they
 
04:41:30.830 --> 04:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
need a booster seat they have to wear
 
04:41:32.750 --> 04:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
that or at least at a minimum they have
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
to be belted in if they they meet
 
04:41:38.070 --> 04:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
certain requirements um so I'm not going
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
to do anything more about antiqu cars
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
this year we may be seeing that next
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
year if I'm reelected if I go through
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
the idea but you may need a change to
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
the section
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
1-c which is
 
04:41:52.990 --> 04:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
a which is about Vehicles equipped with
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
front seats and back seats that way this
 
04:41:57.708 --> 04:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
is written that completely replaces
 
04:42:01.390 --> 04:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
three sub chapters of let's see RSA 265
 
04:42:06.830 --> 04:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
107a so 1 C I noticed has some um has
 
04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
some exceptions in it which most you
 
04:42:12.030 --> 04:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
probably uh which you probably want to
 
04:42:15.510 --> 04:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
keep as is about uh there's some things
 
04:42:17.670 --> 04:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
in there about like if it's a school bus
 
04:42:20.830 --> 04:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
or if a child has an individual
 
04:42:23.310 --> 04:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
education program which says he can't
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
here she can't be restrained or an
 
04:42:28.270 --> 04:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
antique vehicles I mentioned here so we
 
04:42:29.470 --> 04:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:42:31.990 --> 04:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
keep so probably need to add some some
 
04:42:33.390 --> 04:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
of that at least some of that stuff back
 
04:42:35.310 --> 04:42:35.320 align:start position:0%
in the section one desk see especially
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral 2 I'm sure you've all
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
got the law books in front of me like I
 
04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
do no just kidding but when you have a
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
work session um you'll have to you may
 
04:42:45.670 --> 04:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
have to address that one well that's
 
04:42:48.030 --> 04:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
actually uh well that's actually a
 
04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
section two so anyway so you you may so
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
you actually maybe you don't need to
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't need to amend the law
 
04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
you can just pass it as is so that's um
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's basically uh that's basically the
 
04:43:02.430 --> 04:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
bill you would have had much better
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
explanation from representative Gibbons
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
but she can't be here because she has a
 
04:43:09.390 --> 04:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
actual job outside the legislature and
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
whereas I'm a little bit more flexible
 
04:43:13.350 --> 04:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm here so um I'd be happy to answer
 
04:43:14.590 --> 04:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
any questions if you think I could
 
04:43:14.600 --> 04:43:16.788 align:start position:0%

answer

04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.040 --> 05:02:33.350 align:start position:0%

bill for the record I'm representative
 
05:03:15.868 --> 05:03:15.878 align:start position:0%
Margaret dry I serve Sullivan district 7
 
05:03:18.150 --> 05:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
which includes the towns of Newport
 
05:03:21.948 --> 05:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
Unity Charlestown planfield and Cornish
 
05:03:24.390 --> 05:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
the home of the iconic Cornish Windsor

Covered Bridge across the Connecticut
 
05:03:30.510 --> 05:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
River also the largest and long oldest
 
05:03:35.628 --> 05:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.030 --> 05:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
the covered bridges of New Hampshire are
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
both historic and iconic and they're
 
05:03:43.990 --> 05:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
beautiful a couple years ago I watched
 
05:03:47.470 --> 05:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
the French console come up from Boston
 
05:03:49.270 --> 05:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
to watch the unveiling of a marker for
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
his countryman Lafayette who crossed the
 
05:03:53.948 --> 05:03:53.958 align:start position:0%
Cornish Windsor covered bridge on his
 
05:03:57.750 --> 05:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
reunion tour about 200 years ago uh the
 
05:03:59.430 --> 05:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
council paid no attention to the
 
05:04:02.030 --> 05:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
unveiling because he was so busy looking
 
05:04:04.270 --> 05:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
at the cover Bridge the Connecticut
 
05:04:07.628 --> 05:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
River and the backdrop of M es scotney I
 
05:04:10.110 --> 05:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
see tourists in front of this bridge uh
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
every season of the
 
05:04:15.230 --> 05:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
year unfortunately the things that make
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
these Bridges so appealing are also uh
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
the things that make them susceptible to
 
05:04:23.708 --> 05:04:23.718 align:start position:0%
damage they're not made of concrete and
 
05:04:26.510 --> 05:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
steel they are from a simpler time and
 
05:04:28.270 --> 05:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
they're really not made to accommodate
 
05:04:30.070 --> 05:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
the kind of traffic that goes on them
 
05:04:34.110 --> 05:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
today especially box trucks um um and uh
 
05:04:36.548 --> 05:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunate GPS
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
systems uh this bill is designed to
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
increase the penalties for damage to
 
05:04:44.430 --> 05:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
covered bridges stemming from violating
 
05:04:47.070 --> 05:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
height weight or dimensional
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
limits the sponsors of these bills uh
 
05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
all have covered bridges of this bill um
 
05:04:53.590 --> 05:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
all have covered bridges in their
 
05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
districts and I think each one of them
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
has a horror story about damage to the
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
bridge in their District I want to just
 
05:05:01.510 --> 05:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
go through the bill with you really
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
quickly and
 
05:05:05.788 --> 05:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
tell you what it what it
 
05:05:10.830 --> 05:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
entails in section one Roman numeral one
 
05:05:13.470 --> 05:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh this covers most of the stories that
 
05:05:16.110 --> 05:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
make the news this is the visible damage
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
like broken Rafters or damages to walls
 
05:05:21.788 --> 05:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
that you would see and what it does is
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
it raises the fine of the offense up to
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh $1,000 and if it the offense
 
05:05:30.910 --> 05:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
substantially impedes the flow of ta
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
traffic the fine can be up to
 
05:05:38.470 --> 05:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
$2,000 neurom mineral 2 talks about the
 
05:05:41.070 --> 05:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
damage that is not immediately visible
 
05:05:43.150 --> 05:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
and this came because of the request of
 
05:05:46.510 --> 05:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
the lime police chief uh he says
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
overweight Vehicles go through their
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
covered bridge on River Road uh all the
 
05:05:55.628 --> 05:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
time there's no debris left behind but
 
05:05:57.990 --> 05:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
the wear and tear on the planks is such
 
05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
that when he goes to the town meeting
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
this year he's going to ask for 600 or 7
 
05:06:05.510 --> 05:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to repair the
 
05:06:09.990 --> 05:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
bridge Roman numeral um these well this
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
is a little bit lower
 
05:06:15.548 --> 05:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
fine but it can be up to $2,000 if it
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
impedes traffic and we got these numbers
 
05:06:21.910 --> 05:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
um by a lot of research the original
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
story of why the bill came uh to pass I
 
05:06:26.590 --> 05:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
will leave to the police chief from
 
05:06:28.030 --> 05:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
Cornish and I don't want to steal his
 
05:06:30.030 --> 05:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
Thunder but the model for this
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
legislation came after a sum's worth of
 
05:06:34.590 --> 05:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
research last year from legislative
 
05:06:36.788 --> 05:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
Services we looked at all the states
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
that had covered bridges uh from
 
05:06:41.350 --> 05:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
Virginia Pennsylvania Ohio Maine Vermont
 
05:06:43.548 --> 05:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
to see if anybody had legislation like
 
05:06:45.670 --> 05:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
we would like to have and what we found
 
05:06:48.750 --> 05:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
was that Vermont though very recent had
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
something that we would like to model
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so I spoke to the um gentleman who
 
05:06:56.910 --> 05:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
sponsored that legislation in Vermont he
 
05:06:58.750 --> 05:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
told us how they arrived at their
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
decisions and what the effects have been
 
05:07:04.270 --> 05:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh in 201 22 they passed they raised the
 
05:07:05.590 --> 05:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
fine to
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
$1,000 um up to 2,000 if it impedes
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
traffic and double for uh a repeat
 
05:07:16.350 --> 05:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
offense um they also uh in the next year
 
05:07:19.868 --> 05:07:19.878 align:start position:0%
found that the only town that had had a
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
a problem since they went into effect
 
05:07:25.948 --> 05:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
was the town of lindenville and so they
 
05:07:27.910 --> 05:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
because they have Dylan's rule were able
 
05:07:31.350 --> 05:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
to allow the town of Lyndon to make its
 
05:07:31.360 --> 05:07:32.948 align:start position:0%
to allow the town of Lyndon to make its
own

05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
own
 
05:07:35.868 --> 05:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
uh fine and the town took them up on it
 
05:07:38.230 --> 05:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
and they made it $5,000 for a First
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
Defense and 10,000 for a
 
05:07:43.990 --> 05:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
second whoa yeah well they're not
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
messing around in Lyndon okay um and
 
05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
they've had a lot of accidents on their
 
05:07:49.120 --> 05:07:50.708 align:start position:0%
they've had a lot of accidents on their
Bridge

05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
Bridge
 
05:07:53.708 --> 05:07:53.718 align:start position:0%
uh the part three new Roman Newall 3
 
05:07:56.350 --> 05:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
here just kind of elaborates uh why it's
 
05:07:58.030 --> 05:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
important there's so many parts to a
 
05:08:00.990 --> 05:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
covered bridge that can be damaged and
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
and can cause it can impede traffic and
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
be and just cause regular repairs to
 
05:08:09.548 --> 05:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
that are maybe uh need to be done
 
05:08:13.830 --> 05:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
quickly uh number Roman numeral four uh
 
05:08:17.470 --> 05:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
the um the fine will be uh inured to the
 
05:08:19.868 --> 05:08:19.878 align:start position:0%
municipality that has is responsible for
 
05:08:21.788 --> 05:08:21.798 align:start position:0%
the bridge I didn't know this until I
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
started researching this but there are
 
05:08:24.548 --> 05:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
five bridges in the state of New
 
05:08:26.470 --> 05:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the state maintains and
 
05:08:28.030 --> 05:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
the Cornish Windsor bridge is one of
 
05:08:30.750 --> 05:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
those but Cornish has other Bridges
 
05:08:34.310 --> 05:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
covered bridges in in the town so um I
 
05:08:36.430 --> 05:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
think it it was really fair that the
 
05:08:37.708 --> 05:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
state would get the money from this
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
bridge and the town would get the money
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
from tickets for other
 
05:08:44.788 --> 05:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
Bridges and finally
 
05:08:49.270 --> 05:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
um number five is uh covers and makes
 
05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
clear uh the cost of repairs in addition
 
05:08:54.750 --> 05:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
to the cost of the ticket and clarifies
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
who is responsible in any event that
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
involves a rented
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
vehicle sections 2 three and four of the
 
05:09:01.798 --> 05:09:03.070 align:start position:0%
vehicle sections 2 three and four of the
bill

05:09:03.070 --> 05:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:09:05.230 --> 05:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
really just are our due diligence we
 
05:09:07.230 --> 05:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
went to other sections of the statutes
 
05:09:09.150 --> 05:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
that uh talk about height weight and
 
05:09:11.548 --> 05:09:11.558 align:start position:0%
fines and then included the fact that
 
05:09:16.350 --> 05:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
this is uh notwithstanding this bill the
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
other things stand so it doesn't change
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
any of those just reminds us that we
 
05:09:24.190 --> 05:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
also have this um that's kind of similar
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
and that's all that's really done in
 
05:09:26.718 --> 05:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
and that's all that's really done in
this

05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:09:30.910 --> 05:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
bill the point of the bill is not to be
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
punitive it's to be
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
preventative the best result from
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation would be to
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
make it more desirable for someone to go
 
05:09:44.270 --> 05:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
around a covered bridge rather than
 
05:09:46.830 --> 05:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
through a covered bridge when their
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle is too big or too heavy or will
 
05:09:53.708 --> 05:09:53.718 align:start position:0%
cause damage and I hope you will help
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
pass this first legislation about
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
covered bridges since
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
1963 uh and uh help me by passing and
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and I'm happy to
 
05:10:07.470 --> 05:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um any questions
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
05:10:18.868 --> 05:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
question can you give us an idea of what
 
05:10:20.910 --> 05:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
type of vehicles are causing uh the
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
damage on these Bridges thank you for
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
the question yes I can um and I think
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
that um uh Chief Hackett will goit more
 
05:10:31.548 --> 05:10:31.558 align:start position:0%
into that but um at this point it's a
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
lot of it is is just plain geometry box
 
05:10:37.430 --> 05:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
trucks don't fit in something that goes
 
05:10:40.910 --> 05:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
like this the Box part hits the rafters
 
05:10:43.350 --> 05:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
you can try to scoot your car down the
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
middle of a bridge but in a two-lane
 
05:10:47.788 --> 05:10:47.798 align:start position:0%
Bridge that's kind of frowned upon and
 
05:10:49.788 --> 05:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
uh that's one of the things people are
 
05:10:52.190 --> 05:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
not aware of the heights of some things
 
05:10:54.750 --> 05:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
that they rent they don't match uh
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
they're they just don't fit into the
 
05:11:00.670 --> 05:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
covered bridge so um it is not basically
 
05:11:05.910 --> 05:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative C I'll start at the end
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
table thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:11:12.990 --> 05:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I was a little
 
05:11:15.510 --> 05:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
curious uh do most of these Bridges have
 
05:11:18.750 --> 05:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
video surveillance of any kind thank you
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
for bringing that up uh there is a
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
companion bill kind of going through um
 
05:11:25.990 --> 05:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
criminal safety that would allow video
 
05:11:30.150 --> 05:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
cameras on um the to be placed on them
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
just because a lot of these accidents
 
05:11:37.270 --> 05:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
are hit and run it's hard to get um
 
05:11:38.788 --> 05:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
money to fix a bill when you don't know
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
who did it so these they're kind of
 
05:11:42.788 --> 05:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
companion bills but we were they were
 
05:11:42.798 --> 05:11:44.708 align:start position:0%
companion bills but we were they were
developed

05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
developed
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
separately RBS and
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:11:54.030 --> 05:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question is this bridge or the
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
bridge in general you talk about does
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
that go over the river to the Vermont
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
side and if so what happens that they're
 
05:12:04.110 --> 05:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
coming from the Vermont side over to New
 
05:12:06.110 --> 05:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they damage the bridge on
 
05:12:08.548 --> 05:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
the Vermont soil I
 
05:12:11.510 --> 05:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
guess so thank you for that question
 
05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:16.990 --> 05:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
ours represent
 
05:12:18.990 --> 05:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
pondon thank you some of my questions
 
05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
are already answered so thank you um my
 
05:12:24.430 --> 05:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh that leaves me with the Roman numeral
 
05:12:29.868 --> 05:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
3 uh line 15 the uh towing a trailer and
 
05:12:32.430 --> 05:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
where it's posted nothing in tow
 
05:12:34.628 --> 05:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
I don't see any fine associated with
 
05:12:36.708 --> 05:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
that specifically is there something I'm
 
05:12:39.830 --> 05:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
missing on this or would it does a fine
 
05:12:41.510 --> 05:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
fall under another one of the other
 
05:12:43.510 --> 05:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
paragraphs that that would thank you
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
that would be the other dimensional
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
limit that's up in Roman numerals one
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
and two
 
05:12:52.830 --> 05:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
05:12:55.390 --> 05:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
committee I just have one quick one line
 
05:12:58.910 --> 05:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
17 Roman four um all fines under the
 
05:13:00.990 --> 05:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
section shall Ure to the municipality or
 
05:13:03.070 --> 05:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
agency that's responsible are there any
 
05:13:06.510 --> 05:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
other examples U where the fine money
 
05:13:09.590 --> 05:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
would go to anybody other than the
 
05:13:12.150 --> 05:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
state because usually that's where the
 
05:13:14.230 --> 05:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
fines go is to the state I just I didn't
 
05:13:16.270 --> 05:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
know if there were other examples um
 
05:13:17.670 --> 05:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I do not
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that but I think you
 
05:13:20.910 --> 05:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
should ask that of the police chief when
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
he comes up fair enough seeing no other
 
05:13:28.910 --> 05:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.920 --> 05:13:30.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:13:30.760 --> 05:13:32.270 align:start position:0%
you
uh

05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:13:34.030 --> 05:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes representative
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
fauler in support of the bill looking
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
for three
 
05:13:41.110 --> 05:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
minutes welcome back sir thank you think
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
I can be quick uh question about
 
05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
surveillance kind of introduce the
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
subject I can attest to uh the value of
 
05:13:50.510 --> 05:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
these Bridges to the tourism in the
 
05:13:52.910 --> 05:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
state I see people I have four of these
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
bridges in my town Swansea I'm sorry I
 
05:13:57.310 --> 05:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
should have introduce myself I'm Barry
 
05:13:59.830 --> 05:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
fauler representing Swansea and
 
05:14:02.270 --> 05:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
Richmond uh we have forign Swansea and
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
two in the next town over in Winchester
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
see people all the time coming up taking
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
pictures people driving up from
 
05:14:11.470 --> 05:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
Connecticut New York whatever bus loads
 
05:14:13.948 --> 05:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
of people come up in in leap
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
season and I know the bridge near me
 
05:14:17.470 --> 05:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
that I drive through a couple times a
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
day has had uh damage from three
 
05:14:24.750 --> 05:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
different vehicle impacts and was like
 
05:14:27.270 --> 05:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
that through the uh Through The Fall
 
05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
season uh there's a hit and run the
 
05:14:33.628 --> 05:14:33.638 align:start position:0%
town's we got to budget the the funds to
 
05:14:35.110 --> 05:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
fix it and it's one of those things that
 
05:14:37.350 --> 05:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
they try to to do within their current
 
05:14:41.110 --> 05:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
budget with u some difficulty um want to
 
05:14:42.868 --> 05:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
explain the the the parallel bill has
 
05:14:45.510 --> 05:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
been through criminal justice uh it
 
05:14:47.910 --> 05:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
provides it it creates an exception to
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
allow video surveillance of bridges for
 
05:14:53.868 --> 05:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
the purpose of identifying the cause of
 
05:14:57.868 --> 05:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
damage to the rdge so it's I think
 
05:14:59.548 --> 05:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
parallel to this bridge it doesn't
 
05:15:02.190 --> 05:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
contradict anything in this bill uh I
 
05:15:04.788 --> 05:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
think the two go together um and that
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
bill I think has got a favorable ought
 
05:15:08.788 --> 05:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
to pass recommendation from from that
 
05:15:11.350 --> 05:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
committee so we're looking forward to at
 
05:15:14.750 --> 05:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
least that that level of U of help in
 
05:15:17.190 --> 05:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
identifying and getting some some
 
05:15:19.190 --> 05:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
compensation for the for the Damage Done
 
05:15:20.510 --> 05:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
to to
 
05:15:23.390 --> 05:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
Bridges uh that support this Bill thank
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you questions from
 
05:15:27.830 --> 05:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
the committee I have one for you if
 
05:15:29.350 --> 05:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
you've been involved in this sure is
 
05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
there any data out there um would
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
indicate how many of these damages were
 
05:15:40.548 --> 05:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:42.990 --> 05:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation I it all the time it's
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't my fault Google I I don't know
 
05:15:47.708 --> 05:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
that there's that's recorded I can tell
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
you that being on the street where you
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
know there's a bridge a quarter mile
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
down the street I on a daily basis see
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
trucks too big go down there realize
 
05:16:00.750 --> 05:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
that they uh well at least a couple
 
05:16:02.788 --> 05:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
times a week realize I can't make it
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
through and have to back up and come
 
05:16:07.830 --> 05:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
back out the other way uh so I know what
 
05:16:10.510 --> 05:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
happens I presume that they they got bad
 
05:16:11.830 --> 05:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
information or they looked at a map and
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the information they
 
05:16:15.990 --> 05:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
needed on it um if the truck is big
 
05:16:17.948 --> 05:16:17.958 align:start position:0%
enough then they give up the problem I
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
think that we're seeing is people try to
 
05:16:22.390 --> 05:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
sneak through even you
 
05:16:24.430 --> 05:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
know when they think they might be able
 
05:16:27.910 --> 05:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
to make it and they they realized they
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
didn't no I just wondering if there was
 
05:16:31.708 --> 05:16:31.718 align:start position:0%
anything out there anybody else from the
 
05:16:33.750 --> 05:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative foot thank you
 
05:16:37.390 --> 05:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I apologize for my not even
 
05:16:39.590 --> 05:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
say with this but are any these Bridges
 
05:16:41.948 --> 05:16:41.958 align:start position:0%
uh listed historically any these wooden
 
05:16:44.310 --> 05:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
bridges and if if so I have a followup
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
if they
 
05:16:48.350 --> 05:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
are right so um as might well speak
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
there is a a state Registry of historic
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
Bridges I think there are 50 something
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
58 bridges on
 
05:16:57.510 --> 05:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
that um some of them have been listed in
 
05:17:00.670 --> 05:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
the National register or state Register
 
05:17:02.510 --> 05:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh most of covered bridges were built in
 
05:17:03.708 --> 05:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
the 19th
 
05:17:05.910 --> 05:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
century here and there I know there's
 
05:17:07.470 --> 05:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
one in my town that was built in the
 
05:17:09.948 --> 05:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
19th century and burned down and then
 
05:17:11.868 --> 05:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
was replaced in
 
05:17:14.948 --> 05:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
the I don't know the last 50
 
05:17:18.350 --> 05:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
years um but an attempt to you know
 
05:17:20.670 --> 05:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
replicate the original one so say most
 
05:17:23.830 --> 05:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
of these are historic follow please
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair and um so
 
05:17:30.030 --> 05:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
are there any current legislation rsas
 
05:17:32.788 --> 05:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
that a specific specific to
 
05:17:35.070 --> 05:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
historical uh buildings or Bridges or
 
05:17:36.910 --> 05:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
anything like that that would also cover
 
05:17:40.470 --> 05:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:42.350 --> 05:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
know well I mean I think we're looking
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
at Motor Vehicle Laws and um and
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
liability laws
 
05:17:49.670 --> 05:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
that my experience with historic
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
preservation legislation hasn't
 
05:17:55.750 --> 05:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
really considered that to be within the
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
purview of that particular so this um
 
05:18:01.030 --> 05:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know these These are F similar to
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
other find for motor vehicle
 
05:18:03.360 --> 05:18:05.070 align:start position:0%
other find for motor vehicle
violations

05:18:05.070 --> 05:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
violations
 
05:18:09.910 --> 05:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:12.590 --> 05:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
laws all right seeing no other questions
 
05:18:21.310 --> 05:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:24.350 --> 05:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
much I guess we'll go for information
 
05:18:29.110 --> 05:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
sake looks like uh e Douglas hacket in
 
05:18:30.548 --> 05:18:30.558 align:start position:0%
support of the bill looking for three
 
05:18:30.558 --> 05:18:41.430 align:start position:0%
support of the bill looking for three
minutes

05:18:41.430 --> 05:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.548 --> 05:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
welcome there you go okay sorry about
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
that good afternoon um my name is uh
 
05:18:50.190 --> 05:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
Chief Doug Hackett from Cornish Police
 
05:18:51.708 --> 05:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
Department I'm here to speak in support
 
05:18:53.910 --> 05:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
05:18:57.030 --> 05:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
1457 I've been employed at Cornish PD
 
05:19:00.430 --> 05:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
since 1988 or 36 years as some of you
 
05:19:02.150 --> 05:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
may know Cornish is is home to four
 
05:19:04.590 --> 05:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
historic covered bridges with the grand
 
05:19:07.070 --> 05:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
Cornish Windsor Covered Bridge being the
 
05:19:10.150 --> 05:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
most favorite the most visited and the
 
05:19:13.948 --> 05:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
most traveled bridge is over 157 years
 
05:19:16.548 --> 05:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
old and hundreds of vehicles pass across
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
it every day sadly some of those
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles are over height overweight and
 
05:19:22.750 --> 05:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
they should not be on our
 
05:19:25.868 --> 05:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
Bridge however some oversized Vehicles
 
05:19:27.548 --> 05:19:27.558 align:start position:0%
arrive and realize that they're going to
 
05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
have to turn around and go back 10 miles
 
05:19:33.390 --> 05:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
out of their way to get to winds of
 
05:19:36.190 --> 05:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
Vermont they look at that and they make
 
05:19:39.470 --> 05:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
a decision to try to squeeze across the
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
bridge the sides of the bridge are only
 
05:19:45.430 --> 05:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
have a clearance of 9' 2
 
05:19:48.548 --> 05:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
in and the bridge is posted for that the
 
05:19:50.910 --> 05:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
center of the
 
05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
bridge has a lot more clearance and
 
05:19:57.548 --> 05:19:57.558 align:start position:0%
some larger Vehicles can sneak down the
 
05:19:59.590 --> 05:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
middle as long as they can stay in the
 
05:20:01.548 --> 05:20:01.558 align:start position:0%
middle without any damage if the
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
oversized vehicle meets another vehicle
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
in the bridge and pulls to the right
 
05:20:06.548 --> 05:20:06.558 align:start position:0%
they start snapping off
 
05:20:08.708 --> 05:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
crossmembers an example of that is
 
05:20:11.070 --> 05:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
attached to my hand
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
out an oversized truck broke off 12
 
05:20:17.430 --> 05:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
crossmembers crossing the bridge we were
 
05:20:19.230 --> 05:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
lucky the operator stopped on the other
 
05:20:21.948 --> 05:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
side and an investigation
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
ensued our only option was to give him a
 
05:20:28.070 --> 05:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
$62 summons for failing to obey a
 
05:20:28.080 --> 05:20:29.430 align:start position:0%
$62 summons for failing to obey a
traffic

05:20:29.430 --> 05:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
05:20:32.590 --> 05:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
sign we need this legislation to make it
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
a greater deterrent to crossing the
 
05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
bridge than
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
$62 Cornish Police Department responds
 
05:20:41.830 --> 05:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
to between four and eight accidents
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
annually involving the Cornish Windsor
 
05:20:43.440 --> 05:20:45.270 align:start position:0%
annually involving the Cornish Windsor
Covered

05:20:45.270 --> 05:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
Covered
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
Bridge I've also attached an example of
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
Damage Done to our Roo Hill Covered
 
05:20:51.750 --> 05:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
Bridge we respond to two to three
 
05:20:54.628 --> 05:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
accidents annually on that bridge the
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
example I'm presenting today happened in
 
05:21:00.510 --> 05:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
2016 a fully loaded 72 passenger School
 
05:21:03.510 --> 05:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
Bus from another state crossed that
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
bridge it was way over weight it was way
 
05:21:10.270 --> 05:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
over height and they didn't stop an
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
investigation happened and again we
 
05:21:13.830 --> 05:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
identified the
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
operator if he had stopped we could have
 
05:21:18.990 --> 05:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
only find him for
 
05:21:21.788 --> 05:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
$62 because he didn't we charged him
 
05:21:23.868 --> 05:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
with leaving the scene of the accident
 
05:21:25.750 --> 05:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
our bridges are historic and they need
 
05:21:28.030 --> 05:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
to be protected please join me in
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
sending a message that if you ignore the
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
height and weight
 
05:21:34.750 --> 05:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions you will have to pay and
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
that we won't tolerate the damage any
 
05:21:40.590 --> 05:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
longer thank you thank you thank you sir

Crawford thank you Mr chairman I'm just
 
05:21:49.470 --> 05:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
curious um does your insurance company
 
05:21:51.990 --> 05:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
cover the damage from the bridge when
 
05:21:55.390 --> 05:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
someone does that um I I believe this my
 
05:21:56.750 --> 05:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
experience from the state level being
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
the larger Bridge which is the
 
05:21:59.590 --> 05:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state there is no
 
05:22:01.708 --> 05:22:01.718 align:start position:0%
insurance on it and which sell fed I
 
05:22:04.230 --> 05:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
believe the town's Municipal policy I do
 
05:22:05.948 --> 05:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
know they're I do know they're insured
 
05:22:07.548 --> 05:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
and they're on our insurance but I don't
 
05:22:11.150 --> 05:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
know the facts about the LI um the
 
05:22:13.510 --> 05:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
deductibles or anything to that nature
 
05:22:16.310 --> 05:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
just a follow up U so when the when
 
05:22:18.548 --> 05:22:18.558 align:start position:0%
these Bridges were damaged I don't know
 
05:22:20.548 --> 05:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
when they were damaged the dates on them
 
05:22:23.110 --> 05:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
how did you fix them um the state fixed
 
05:22:25.150 --> 05:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
the big one we closed it for a few hours
 
05:22:26.510 --> 05:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
while we were trying to assess the
 
05:22:28.628 --> 05:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
damage and they just came down they had
 
05:22:30.990 --> 05:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
to close the bridge again for one lane
 
05:22:34.350 --> 05:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
traffic and spend a day fixing the 12 or
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
more broken cross members the town
 
05:22:39.628 --> 05:22:39.638 align:start position:0%
Bridge was done out of town funds funds
 
05:22:42.350 --> 05:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions
 
05:22:42.360 --> 05:22:43.310 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions
representative

05:22:43.310 --> 05:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
London yes one question um you state
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
that the the 10 mile distance between
 
05:22:52.470 --> 05:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
windmont and Cornish on that roadway is
 
05:22:55.548 --> 05:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
it posted uh before any Vehicles turn on
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
that road that it's it's a li it's a
 
05:23:01.750 --> 05:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
restricted road so what I'm trying to
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
get at is limiting them to turn around
 
05:23:06.150 --> 05:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
10 miles prior to the bridge instead of
 
05:23:07.830 --> 05:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
getting to the bridge I I don't believe
 
05:23:10.670 --> 05:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
it is posted I mean again there's like
 
05:23:14.430 --> 05:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
five different onlet to Route 12a um the
 
05:23:16.430 --> 05:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
biggest obviously being the 103
 
05:23:19.150 --> 05:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
intersection down in Claremont um but
 
05:23:20.670 --> 05:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
again they all come up they all see the
 
05:23:22.868 --> 05:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
sign and it's just that I think I can
 
05:23:25.628 --> 05:23:25.638 align:start position:0%
squeak across and interestingly enough
 
05:23:28.350 --> 05:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
the bridge on the Vermont side is
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
shorter than our Covered Bridge so once
 
05:23:32.430 --> 05:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
they get across Frost most of the time
 
05:23:34.030 --> 05:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
they have to turn around and come back
 
05:23:35.670 --> 05:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
because they can't get under the Vermont
 
05:23:38.110 --> 05:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
side so most of the damage that never
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
happens to the Windsor side because they
 
05:23:42.628 --> 05:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
can't get to it they have to come from
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you represent
 
05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
sers thank you Mr chair uh question
 
05:23:51.390 --> 05:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
about video it's do you have any video
 
05:23:54.190 --> 05:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
there now and how would you ticket or
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
can you ticket by just getting a video
 
05:23:59.670 --> 05:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
um there is no video now that's why we
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
introduced the legislation to allow for
 
05:24:03.390 --> 05:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
the video surveillance of the bridge um
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the companion bill um I my
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
understanding of that bill is is it's
 
05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
only to identify the damage it's not
 
05:24:13.070 --> 05:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
meant to watch the video back and just
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
issue citations for crossing the bridge
 
05:24:19.350 --> 05:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
um it's meant that video bill was
 
05:24:22.590 --> 05:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
intended to identify who damaged the
 
05:24:24.510 --> 05:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
bridge I would venture to say and I
 
05:24:26.910 --> 05:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a hard and fast number um
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
probably nine out of 10 times we go for
 
05:24:31.310 --> 05:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
chunks of the bridge in the middle of
 
05:24:33.548 --> 05:24:33.558 align:start position:0%
the the travel Lane and there's nobody
 
05:24:35.548 --> 05:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
there it's very rare that we identify
 
05:24:38.510 --> 05:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
who causes the damage to
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
these any other questions representative
 
05:24:45.788 --> 05:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chairman um as I've
 
05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
been investigating this um at what other
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
states do uh some have before you get to
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
the bridge they have a crossbar at the
 
05:24:57.070 --> 05:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
same height or less height uh so you hit
 
05:25:00.270 --> 05:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
that first instead of come but I if if
 
05:25:02.868 --> 05:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
I'm correct that I cross the Cornish
 
05:25:05.070 --> 05:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
Bridge there' be no room for a cross bar
 
05:25:06.510 --> 05:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
there because it's it's a turn right off
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
the highway correct it's literally from
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
Route 12a onto the bridge the ramp is
 
05:25:14.350 --> 05:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
maybe a two lengths of this desk before
 
05:25:16.430 --> 05:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
you're into the bridge and additionally
 
05:25:18.390 --> 05:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
with it I you hear everybody say it
 
05:25:19.750 --> 05:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
makes them ugly because you're putting
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
this big monstrosity in front of our
 
05:25:24.070 --> 05:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
historic covered bridges um if I could
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
just also add somebody had a question
 
05:25:27.548 --> 05:25:27.558 align:start position:0%
earlier that wasn't answered
 
05:25:30.150 --> 05:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
historically it's box truckses box
 
05:25:30.160 --> 05:25:31.830 align:start position:0%
historically it's box truckses box
trucks

05:25:31.830 --> 05:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
trucks
 
05:25:34.948 --> 05:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
motor homes and school buses that are
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
causing the damage from my experience um
 
05:25:40.110 --> 05:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
a significant number of motor homes as
 
05:25:42.230 --> 05:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
well usually they're shearing off their
 
05:25:43.948 --> 05:25:43.958 align:start position:0%
AC units that are up on top of the
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
camper on the cross members going in or
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
out I did have a uh a flatbed tow truck
 
05:25:54.670 --> 05:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
with a cabota tractor on it fit going up
 
05:25:58.708 --> 05:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:02.310 --> 05:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
Bridge representative s clear
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:26:06.190 --> 05:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
chair would you in your capacity of
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
chief chief uh from this point forward
 
05:26:11.750 --> 05:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
try to get the state to invest in more
 
05:26:14.590 --> 05:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
signage like was brought up by a couple
 
05:26:16.270 --> 05:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
other reps further down the roads
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
because I I understand you don't want it
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
right in front of the bridge for you
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
know the viewing but definitely further
 
05:26:25.150 --> 05:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
back would could you would you be in
 
05:26:26.548 --> 05:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
favor of doing that I I would be in
 
05:26:28.070 --> 05:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
favor of putting a sign further back
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
down the road as well my fear sir is in
 
05:26:31.150 --> 05:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
05:26:33.510 --> 05:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
36 years I've become a little bit
 
05:26:35.628 --> 05:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
pessimistic and they don't follow the 9
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
foot two sign they're not going to
 
05:26:39.470 --> 05:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
follow the sign 10 miles down the road
 
05:26:42.990 --> 05:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
just quick s my I guess uh I want to be
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
clearer not not a
 
05:26:50.910 --> 05:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
9.2 but no trucks no school buses no box
 
05:26:53.230 --> 05:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
trucks it would have to be a really big
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
sign that's okay because you have a big
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
problem I do have a big problem exactly
 
05:26:59.190 --> 05:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
and and the issue is is putting it
 
05:27:01.990 --> 05:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
further back like it would proba it's
 
05:27:03.750 --> 05:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
really tough to if you know the
 
05:27:05.948 --> 05:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
geography specifically speaking of the
 
05:27:08.190 --> 05:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
Windsor Cornish Covered Bridge um
 
05:27:09.868 --> 05:27:09.878 align:start position:0%
there's a sharp corner before it and
 
05:27:11.708 --> 05:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
there's no real place to put it I've
 
05:27:13.750 --> 05:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
thought in my head before technology has
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
to say you know 200 fet before you get
 
05:27:19.548 --> 05:27:19.558 align:start position:0%
to the intersection with the bridge
 
05:27:21.430 --> 05:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
measure what's going by and if it's over
 
05:27:23.910 --> 05:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
9 feet flash a sign saying no left turn
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know I'm trying to come up with
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
anything to to do I'm not against Des
 
05:27:31.990 --> 05:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
sign further down um but there's so many
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
turns and stuff off that road where
 
05:27:35.948 --> 05:27:35.958 align:start position:0%
would be the correct place to put it
 
05:27:37.230 --> 05:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
that would get their
 
05:27:39.390 --> 05:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
attention and if they're only a mile
 
05:27:41.070 --> 05:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
away and they still have to turn around
 
05:27:42.350 --> 05:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
and go back nine
 
05:27:47.390 --> 05:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
miles maybe 10 miles back thank thank
 
05:27:50.070 --> 05:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
05:27:51.948 --> 05:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
05:27:55.270 --> 05:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
much uh next up chair recognizes match
 
05:27:59.868 --> 05:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
gra from the Hampshire Municipal
 
05:27:59.878 --> 05:28:00.948 align:start position:0%
gra from the Hampshire Municipal
Association

05:28:00.948 --> 05:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
Association
 
05:28:04.510 --> 05:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:07.230 --> 05:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair n g for the
 
05:28:09.150 --> 05:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
municipal Association I'm glad to join
 
05:28:11.470 --> 05:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
you all again today uh we are in support
 
05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh over the last couple
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
years uh covered bridges have been
 
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
damaged in Campton Cornish Jackson
 
05:28:20.628 --> 05:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
Lancaster and Swansea to the extent that
 
05:28:22.628 --> 05:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
they've actually made the news as you've
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
heard from the police chief of course
 
05:28:27.310 --> 05:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
many many bridges throughout the state
 
05:28:29.430 --> 05:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
get damaged much more frequently that
 
05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't make the news many of those are
 
05:28:33.750 --> 05:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
owned by municipalities and therefore
 
05:28:35.470 --> 05:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
the municipal taxpayers are the ones
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
footing the bill to repair those um our
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
hope is that by um increasing the
 
05:28:43.990 --> 05:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
penalties for striking the bridge for
 
05:28:45.628 --> 05:28:45.638 align:start position:0%
causing this type of damage that it will
 
05:28:48.030 --> 05:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
discourage people from engaging in that
 
05:28:50.830 --> 05:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
type of activity as well as uh recover
 
05:28:53.190 --> 05:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
some of the costs for the damages
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
obviously it won't recover the full
 
05:28:57.110 --> 05:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
costs um but the hope is that if we can
 
05:28:59.628 --> 05:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
at least decrease some of the damage um
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
we can put uh a better foot uh to to
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
this problem I'm happy to answer any
 
05:29:07.670 --> 05:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions the commane may have thank you
 
05:29:09.910 --> 05:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee seeing
 
05:29:12.910 --> 05:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
none thank you again thank you and our
 
05:29:16.110 --> 05:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
final speaker signed up for this bill is
 
05:29:18.750 --> 05:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
Bill Caswell uh representing the
 
05:29:20.628 --> 05:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
National Society for the preservation of
 
05:29:20.638 --> 05:29:21.628 align:start position:0%
National Society for the preservation of
covered

05:29:21.628 --> 05:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
covered
 
05:29:24.030 --> 05:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
bridges um welcome in support of the
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill yeah in full disclosure I grew up
 
05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
underneath the Swiftwater covered bridge
 
05:29:31.548 --> 05:29:31.558 align:start position:0%
in the big Eddie
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
excellent so yes I'm Bill Caswell
 
05:29:35.670 --> 05:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
president of the National Society for
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
the preservation of cover Bridges and
 
05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking in favor of the bill uh our
 
05:29:42.788 --> 05:29:42.798 align:start position:0%
organization if you're not familiar with
 
05:29:44.788 --> 05:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
it is an all volunteer nonprofit
 
05:29:46.590 --> 05:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
organization founded in
 
05:29:50.830 --> 05:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
1954 to advocate for um the needs of our
 
05:29:52.708 --> 05:29:52.718 align:start position:0%
nation's historic cover
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
Bridges we receive damage reports either
 
05:29:59.750 --> 05:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
through um news or from our members
 
05:30:02.190 --> 05:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
sending information about incidents
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the country I mean this is
 
05:30:05.070 --> 05:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
definitely not a New Hampshire problem
 
05:30:07.868 --> 05:30:07.878 align:start position:0%
or uh anywhere that has cover Bridges
 
05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
open to traffic are experiencing similar
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
things and to answer the uh well not so
 
05:30:16.948 --> 05:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
much answer but to provide some more
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
information about earlier questions um
 
05:30:23.548 --> 05:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
what we hear is a lot of rental trucks
 
05:30:25.990 --> 05:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
the U-Haul trucks the rider trucks where
 
05:30:27.910 --> 05:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the driver is inexperienced not
 
05:30:30.548 --> 05:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
familiar with the height of the vehicle
 
05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
so even if they saw the 9 foot2
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
clearance they don't necessarily realize
 
05:30:35.708 --> 05:30:35.718 align:start position:0%
even though it's printed right on the
 
05:30:37.830 --> 05:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
back of the truck um that their vehicle
 
05:30:40.270 --> 05:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
is 12 feet high and it's going to get
 
05:30:44.628 --> 05:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
stuck so um it's there's a lot to you
 
05:30:46.628 --> 05:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
know yes we need to better inform people
 
05:30:48.390 --> 05:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
how do you get that information out to
 
05:30:51.150 --> 05:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
those people um who are not even aware
 
05:30:52.510 --> 05:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
of the size of their vehicle when they
 
05:30:53.910 --> 05:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
try to
 
05:30:56.070 --> 05:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
cross we realize that there are many
 
05:30:58.190 --> 05:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
instance that we never even hear about
 
05:31:00.910 --> 05:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
um my wife and I let a tour of cover
 
05:31:03.190 --> 05:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
Bridges a three-day tour in Northern
 
05:31:05.948 --> 05:31:05.958 align:start position:0%
Vermont last September and nearly every
 
05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
bridge we stopped to visit of the 33 on
 
05:31:11.070 --> 05:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
that trip um had some kind of scarring
 
05:31:13.868 --> 05:31:13.878 align:start position:0%
from vehicle damage so I mean it might
 
05:31:15.030 --> 05:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
not have been recent it could have
 
05:31:17.510 --> 05:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
happened over a period of time but also
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
one of the stops we watched a fully
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
loaded school bus drive over a cover
 
05:31:24.270 --> 05:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
bridge with a uh three-ton weight limit
 
05:31:27.150 --> 05:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
and that's and I contacted the town
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
selectman to inquire about that and the
 
05:31:32.150 --> 05:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
bus had been running that route twice a
 
05:31:34.708 --> 05:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
day for the last two years exceeding
 
05:31:36.628 --> 05:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
greatly exceeding that speed that um
 
05:31:39.030 --> 05:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
weight limit so of course you know we
 
05:31:40.470 --> 05:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
contacted the Vermont agency of
 
05:31:42.830 --> 05:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation who wanted to go out and
 
05:31:44.430 --> 05:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
and do an inspection on the bridge to
 
05:31:46.390 --> 05:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
see what kind of long-term damage might
 
05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
have been caused by that vehicle
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
crossing a bridge all the time I don't
 
05:31:52.270 --> 05:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
know the results of that inspection but
 
05:31:54.830 --> 05:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know it it definitely got people
 
05:31:58.868 --> 05:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
aware when when we contacted
 
05:32:01.190 --> 05:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
them the
 
05:32:03.548 --> 05:32:03.558 align:start position:0%
uh again most of these incidents are
 
05:32:06.670 --> 05:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
fairly minor um scrapes and you know
 
05:32:09.310 --> 05:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
broken boards on the portals uh the roof
 
05:32:12.110 --> 05:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
braces yeah they're they get hit a lot
 
05:32:13.948 --> 05:32:13.958 align:start position:0%
and that's you know then you're in a
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
point where you need to repair the
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
bridge uh there have been a couple
 
05:32:19.070 --> 05:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
extreme examples which I wrote in my
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
written testimony so I won't bother
 
05:32:23.910 --> 05:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
taking time to explain through that and
 
05:32:26.830 --> 05:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
the $62 fine is certainly not much of a
 
05:32:29.390 --> 05:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
deterrent really um you know there's
 
05:32:32.230 --> 05:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
some areas where I've been told um like
 
05:32:35.030 --> 05:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
a a company vehicle that's clearly over
 
05:32:36.708 --> 05:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
the weight limit will regularly run
 
05:32:38.430 --> 05:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
through a bridge because it's the
 
05:32:40.350 --> 05:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
shortest route to wherever the going I
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
mean we've seen you know UPS trucks
 
05:32:45.310 --> 05:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
FedEx trucks um go across these Bridges
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they shouldn't um but
 
05:32:51.030 --> 05:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's their shortest route I don't know
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
or nor do I have any expectations that
 
05:32:55.750 --> 05:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know increasing the fine from $62 to
 
05:32:58.270 --> 05:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
$1,000 is going to alleviate the problem
 
05:33:00.190 --> 05:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
but it is definitely a step in the right
 
05:33:03.470 --> 05:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
direction to uh discourage people from
 
05:33:05.230 --> 05:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
from doing this along with some of the
 
05:33:07.750 --> 05:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
other methods that were mentioned uh
 
05:33:10.830 --> 05:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the steel bars I'm totally in
 
05:33:12.830 --> 05:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
favor for them although I realize that
 
05:33:16.830 --> 05:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
they are an isore uh but from standpoint
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
of putting that on a public Highway the
 
05:33:20.110 --> 05:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway Administration does
 
05:33:22.390 --> 05:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
frown on doing introducing any
 
05:33:24.548 --> 05:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
additional low clearance structures to
 
05:33:27.590 --> 05:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
the roadway so that's that's something
 
05:33:29.390 --> 05:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
from the federal standpoint that if your
 
05:33:31.070 --> 05:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
road is receiving federal funds for
 
05:33:33.150 --> 05:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
anything you'd have to consider
 
05:33:35.548 --> 05:33:35.558 align:start position:0%
that um there are other methods that
 
05:33:38.350 --> 05:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
have been attempted and sometimes
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
successful uh there have been a couple
 
05:33:42.590 --> 05:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh cover Bridges especially and it might
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
even be suitable in in the Cornish
 
05:33:46.470 --> 05:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
Windsor case where it is close to an
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
intersection where they physically
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
narrowed the width of the intersection
 
05:33:52.430 --> 05:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
to the point where a large truck can't
 
05:33:56.190 --> 05:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
make the turn so it's you know only a a
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
you know a truck a pickup truck or or a
 
05:34:00.070 --> 05:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
car would be able to get around the
 
05:34:02.110 --> 05:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
corner in the first place so that kind
 
05:34:04.470 --> 05:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
of restricts the size of the vehicle
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
that could get onto the bridge at all so
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
there are some other Alternatives that
 
05:34:11.390 --> 05:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know in addition but um we do feel
 
05:34:13.350 --> 05:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
that increase in the fines is a place to
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
start uh you know people they'll get
 
05:34:17.470 --> 05:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
people's attention when they have to
 
05:34:20.270 --> 05:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
Shell out $1,000 instead of
 
05:34:23.548 --> 05:34:23.558 align:start position:0%
62 so that's all I had thank you very
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
much question from the
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee seeing done thank you very
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
05:34:33.030 --> 05:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay that is the last person I have
 
05:34:36.788 --> 05:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on House Bill 1457 so
 
05:34:38.910 --> 05:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
I'll close the public
 
05:34:43.150 --> 05:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
hearing and that my friends is the last
 
05:34:46.590 --> 05:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
house bill of this term
 
05:34:49.470 --> 05:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
so uh I was hoping to originally exec a
 
05:34:51.628 --> 05:34:51.638 align:start position:0%
few of them today but however with a
 
05:34:53.230 --> 05:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
ranking member having to leave early
 
05:34:56.110 --> 05:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
that's out so next week I'm going to
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
schedule Tuesday all of the bills that
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
we have left to that will be the nine
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
that we had today plus there are six I
 
05:35:05.390 --> 05:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
believe six
 
05:35:07.430 --> 05:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
outstanding so we will have a busy day
 
05:35:10.590 --> 05:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
of exact session next week um there's a
 
05:35:12.030 --> 05:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
couple of the bills I know that are
 
05:35:14.310 --> 05:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
already uh have some amendments being in
 
05:35:16.628 --> 05:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
the works so I just ask everybody to
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
look at the bills read through them if
 
05:35:20.830 --> 05:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
you have ideas for amendments or issues
 
05:35:22.110 --> 05:35:22.120 align:start position:0%
just make sure you get them here by
 
05:35:24.510 --> 05:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we're going to bring them all up
 
05:35:27.470 --> 05:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
Tuesday um obviously we reserve the
 
05:35:30.350 --> 05:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
right to delay if we find something we
 
05:35:32.750 --> 05:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
can hammer out that the amendments may
 
05:35:35.390 --> 05:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
not have accomplished but it I really
 
05:35:37.310 --> 05:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
would like to get our work done if we
 
05:35:39.390 --> 05:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
don't get it done this coming Tuesday
 
05:35:40.750 --> 05:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
then we'll have to come back for another
 
05:35:42.470 --> 05:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
one that's
 
05:35:46.030 --> 05:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
so uh I will probably start at 10: to
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
give us both both sides an opportunity
 
05:35:51.150 --> 05:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
to clock us from 9: to 10: uh I'll
 
05:35:55.708 --> 05:35:55.718 align:start position:0%
schedule them all for morning session if
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
we run long although we don't usually
 
05:35:59.788 --> 05:35:59.798 align:start position:0%
run long in exec sessions we do have the
 
05:36:03.270 --> 05:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon if we need it um so but again
 
05:36:06.030 --> 05:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
