you

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Clark
 
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
Corson uh I am a co-founder with Carol
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
Foss who sits to my immediate right of a
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nonprofit called
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
collaborative Solid Waste
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
strategies and we are focused
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
on education advocacy and Innovation
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
meaning looking outside the box to find
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
altern ways to landfills and
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
incineration Plastics is a vital
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
component of
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
trash people who speak behind me today
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
will are much more qualified to address
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
the particulars and the percentages of
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
trash and so forth Carol can I see just
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
that thanks I forgot
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
this I've provided written testimony I'm
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
not going to take up a lot of your time
 
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.590 align:start position:0%
not going to take up a lot of your time
because

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
others will more specifically address
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
but extended producer
 
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the big scheme of
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
things is a relatively New Concept it
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
shifts the
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
burden from the consumer to the
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
manufacturer which is what Europe has
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
done for five years and Canada just
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
passed about three weeks
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
ago there are 23 bills presently pending
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
in our five contiguous not contiguous
 
00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
in our five contiguous not contiguous
our

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
five New England states that comprise
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
New England 23 bills presently being
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
considered eight of those bills are
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
seriously being considered and will'll
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
probably get past this year two in
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
Connecticut three in Massachusetts one
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
in Vermont and I think one in
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
main I don't I hope from the bottom of
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
my heart
 
00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
that this committee at least allows the
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
full lower chamber to have a look at the
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
nuances and the goodness and the
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
demerits of what the proposed Bill may
 
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
offer I think the Full House deserves to
 
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
hear and I think you as a
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee eyeball to eyeball have an
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
obligation to let them debate it I
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
understand that if the four-person
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
committee it is split down the middle in
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
terms of whether you want to pass it
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
over there it bothers me quite frankly
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
that of a 400 person house it comes down
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
to four people making that decision
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
irrespective of how you come down on
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
it this is a matter of serious it can't
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
be any more
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
serious I have testified numerous times
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
on setbacks from standing bodies of
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
water of landfill and so
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
forth I will just share this with you
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
briefly when I started lobbying here in
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
1971 I was the executive director and
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for the beer industry in New
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I fought my living tail off to
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
defeat bottle
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
bills but lots of things happen in a
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
century and I'm here today to tell you
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is way behind the
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
eightball in terms of seriously
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue of solid waste the
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
climate leachates
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
soil carbon Footprints these are all new
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
terms that weren't around 50 years ago
 
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
50 years ago it was about
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
litter Elma Johnson was a representative
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
in charge of the this the inar
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee and he was a farmer and said
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
that his milk was tasting tiny because
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
the cows were eating so many aluminum
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
cans in those days actually there were
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
steel cans but then it became solid
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
waste not l so much but solid waste
 
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.269 align:start position:0%
waste not l so much but solid waste
recycling

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
Redemption today you have be you you
 
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
have this plastic Council in New
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who cares enough about
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
sustainable Solid Waste Management to to
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
have invested their time effort and
 
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759 align:start position:0%
research and I ask you to at least let
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
the Full House consider the merits of
 
00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:33.710 align:start position:0%
the Full House consider the merits of
their

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
arguments there are two points there are
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
two points I've been asked to make I'm
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
rambling so my my mother is telling me
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
what I should do here I'm going to read
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
these uh a can and this is my testimony
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
a Canadian study compared prices of
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
common consumer produ products at
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
retailers in paired cities with and
 
00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.629 align:start position:0%
retailers in paired cities with and
without

00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
e in eastern central and western Canada
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
and found no correlation between product
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
prices and the presence or absence of
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
epr that is cited as a reference in my
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
testimony a Columbia University study
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
Bose 2022 estimated the impact of Epi
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
regulation on prices of packaged
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
consumer goods based on food price
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
elasticities and USD
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
estimates of packaging
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
costs this study conclude concluded that
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
packaging costs constituted
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 2.3% of food expenditures
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
and estimated that food prices would
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
increase less than 1% of the
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
EP regulations were implemented now I
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
just want to say one thing about that
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
that statement in and by
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.870 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
1% so
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
what what does it cost to handle solid
 
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
waste our state is so far behind our
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
sister States particularly Vermont
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
Maine as it applies to things such as
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
this G jahen tried to get a solid waste
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
master plan
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
2002 just this past October Mike nor is
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
here I think he'll testify to this did
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
the state finally through the
 
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
legislature enact a solid waste master
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
plan maybe that's why 50 plus perent of
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
the trash going into New Hampshire
 
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont insists that it be
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
sanitized it doesn't allow it Maine
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow it New Hampshire allows it
 
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
because we did not be proactive we sat
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
back and let we didn't take I guess we
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
didn't just take it seriously
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
enough I hope that you take Plastics
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
more seriously because this is a time to
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
do it on this bright October morning you
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
can make a difference second
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
Point Epi programs cost to producers are
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
extremely low the Natural Resources
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
Council of Maine used the fee schedule
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
for for
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
Quebec Quebec's uh Epi program it
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
measured weights of 14 different
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
packaging materials to calculate
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
stewardship fees per package got right
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
down in the
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
0. 6 to
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
0032 for paper and
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
cardboard and
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
001 to 013 for various
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
Plastics so you can you can argue about
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
the dimensions of cost until the cows
 
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.630 align:start position:0%
the dimensions of cost until the cows
come

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
home I don't know how relevant that is
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
in the big scheme of things when New
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has has become the trash dump
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
states so I'll simply leave you with the
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
with the the thought
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.669 align:start position:0%
with the the thought
that

00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
the ball is in your
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
hands as a courtesy to the balance of
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
the members in the house I hope you will
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
allow them to debate the
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
issue before New Hampshire falls even
 
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.669 align:start position:0%
issue before New Hampshire falls even
further

00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
behind whether it be the solid waste
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
master plan whether it be the fact that
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
our landfills are now accepting
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts trash main trash Vermont
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
trash and if the Bethlehem project goes
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
through Northern New York trash as well
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's not the issue here today the
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
issue is what component of solid waste
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
can this committee address
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you and I'd ask committee if
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
questions okay I would like to ask a
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
couple questions if I may try to answer
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
them I'm not sure I know we all try but
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh this is education very much for us so
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
you said there's 23 bills uh considered
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
um in in our New England region uh many
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh quite a few uh will may see the light
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
of day this coming within the air do you
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
see other states passing these type of
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
legislation um does that have a
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
detrimental effect on um what we're
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
receiving in New Hampshire
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
potentially I mean uh as far as our
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
waste flow is concerned I'm not sure I
 
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
understand the question with other
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
states passing epr legislation can I
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
have I'm by all means by all means yes a
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
little bit hard of hearing too so oh no
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
no yes by all means and please uh
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
then Carol fos um executive director of
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
collaborative Solid Waste strategies yes
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you again for both
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
appearing um my concern is if we're the
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
last state to pass epr legislation that
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
will make us more vulnerable to uh what
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
waste flow they're shipping in from
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
other states where if we get ahead of
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
the game by passing EPA epr sooner we
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
will have some protection in managing
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
eprs then I would think that the that
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
those States people in those States
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
transfer stations in those States would
 
00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:13.390 align:start position:0%
transfer stations in those States would
be

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
recycling the materials that have
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
eprs so if it's mattresses if it's
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
batteries if
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's used paint
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
whatever people are going to I mean
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
individuals from other states are not
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
personally bringing their trash to New
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's going to a transfer
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
station and it's those transfer stations
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
that are Contracting with somebody to
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
move that waste from the transfer
 
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
station to wherever to a landfill to an
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
incinerator to New Hampshire to to
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
whatever so if those land if those
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
transfers if those states have an epr
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
law then those transfer stations are
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
going to be the ones kind of
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
managing where those materials go so
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you one further
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
question I'll try to be a little more
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
succinct you were talking about the 1%
 
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
cost which I consider to be quite light
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh but could that 1% cost even be offset
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
by reduction in potential reduction in
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
Municipal Taxes I'll answer that
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
one I can assure you and I don't think
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
there would be much argument from either
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
side that manufacturers have already
 
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
built into their cost of doing business
 
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.070 align:start position:0%
built into their cost of doing business
the

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
anticipation of Epi regulation in our
 
00:24:58.269 --> 00:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
state and I can tell you that when the
 
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
bottle bills were passed in Maine
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts and
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut the cost of relabeling
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
containers was built in New Hampshire of
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
course with no sense of broad-based
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
Taxation fully jumped on that to take
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of out of state sales so to
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
Carol's point would more be coming to
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if New Hampshire did not
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
adopt that I don't know the answer to
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
that I would think that manufacturers
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
would have to have I can't believe that
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
they would have 13 states here four
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
states there in the midwest doing one
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
thing and other states not doing another
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
that's how I would have answered your
 
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
first question but they build into the
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
cost of doing business and that's why I
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
I tend to minimize the fact that a one
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
tenth of 1% if that's the cost to a
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
regardless thank you any further
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
next I would like to hear like to hear
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
Walter just have to set
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
up and we have done this before our last
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
on one of our prior committees where we
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
have one screen to share would anybody
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
be opposed if I invited those who would
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
sit and observe the screen to come
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
forward that's fine with that well if
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
you'd like to come and so I can see the
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
screen as we did last time if you were
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
here it give us a quum yeah we have a
 
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:56.590 align:start position:0%
here it give us a quum yeah we have a
quorum

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
actually

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
is it showing up yet think I need to
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
up well we may not have a show oh here
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
it comes there you
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.430 align:start position:0%
it comes there you
go

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
it's working it's working yeah finally
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
John this takes a minute to open these
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
things up sometimes and have them
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
respond to you take all the time you eat
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:28:02.110 align:start position:0%
 
on

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.509 align:start position:0%
 
huh

00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
slideshow ah from beginning it's just
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
option

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
huh um here let me just let me just open
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
up another another version of this my
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
computer's just mocking out on me sorry
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
about that I had it all all set up
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
here it just screen yeah it's uh um it
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't give me full screen my I think
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
I just need to pull it up in a different
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
tech window or something I'll just I'll
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint and this should sorry about
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
the wait so I'm Cynthia Walter I'm the

uh co-director of the uh um no Dover New
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do plastic reduction group in
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
Dover New Hampshire and my screen is
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
just really knocked out here
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
Healy yeah I don't know where I can try
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
yeah can you give me your hand here um
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
right so I do have I will be able to
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
email my um testim testimony to you and
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
I do have the uh PowerPoint slides that
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
I have packets for you folks to take
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
home and maybe one to send to the to the
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
one member of the four person committee
 
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
who's not here today so we'll have those
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
ready for you in just a second we'll
 
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
have the just close these out yeah thank
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
you CH oh you're welcome see if it's
 
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.750 align:start position:0%
you CH oh you're welcome see if it's
getting

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:48.519 align:start position:0%
working so I again I thank you for your
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
effort in working on this difficult
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
problem um I'm a scientist um retired
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
after a 35 year career in teaching and
 
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
research with a focus on pollution
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
problems and solutions excuse
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility laws excuse me I'm going
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
to ask you to turn that microphone more
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
towards yourself if you mind I'm sorry
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
yes so I'm sorry so I'm a scientist
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
retired after a 35y year career in
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
teaching and research with a focus on
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
pollution problems and solutions
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility laws
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
provide important opportunities to
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
develop solutions to our expanding
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
problems of waste and exposures to
 
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
toxins um if you have any questions I'm
 
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
available the exposure to toxins is the
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
today so that's the one yes exactly so
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
um I me I'll just stay standing um so we
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
have savings that we will have from
 
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.590 align:start position:0%
have savings that we will have from
safer

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
safer
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
packaging and I want to show you how we
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
can limit toxics in New Hampshire laws
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
there'll be more market share um savings
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the packaging lifetime more
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
confident consumers and improved company
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
health because they things will be safer
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
for the products themselves and
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
improvements in personal health because
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
they'll be safer for your
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
family so let's start at the beginning
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
what do we have here well let's go
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
through a few problems and then some
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
lose some solutions so problem number
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
one some packaging contains toxins
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
banned in 19 States and all of Europe so
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
we already have in New Hampshire
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
Plastics liner in coffee cups that
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
contains pasas that you can see this
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
plastic uh melt melted liner has then um
 
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
um is something that we're drinking
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
liquid out of form liquid um not a good
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
idea so also containers now we know can
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
leech harmful chemicals exceeding the
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
safe limits for baby foods so we have
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
those in our stores our parents are
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
buying these things for the little tiny
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
babies we have toxic Metals in packaging
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
spread spreading into pars made from
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
recycling now I'm aware that we have a
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
1996 law in New Hampshire we were very
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
forward thinking in
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
'96 to have a law that bans some metals
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
in some kinds of sum packaging so we
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
have a start at that already and no one
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
probably noticed too much about the
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
problems in 1996 associated with the
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
cost issues they simply said having
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
metals are toxic we have to take them
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
out of our packaging we have to take
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
them out of our exposures that's the
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
more important thing to focus on and we
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
did it in 1996 but we stopped with just
 
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
a few of those things for a few
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
situations associated with products and
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
packaging epr now can make that be
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
stronger so the second problem um EP
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
each business is now
 
00:32:59.230 --> 00:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
paying um to to spend money on handling
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
problem chemicals at every step in the
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
supply chain so they're already paying
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
for this and with
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
epr across New Hampshire and across
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
other states as well this actually
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
streamlines business operations and
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
reduces much of their paperwork and
 
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.430 align:start position:0%
reduces much of their paperwork and
worker

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
worker
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
exposures problem three toxics
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
contaminate products people in the
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
environment and recycling to begin the
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
products the products contain right now
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
if you look around you over 10,000
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
different additives 4,000 of which have
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
not been studied but for those that have
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
been studied over a thousand showed up
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
to be of High Health concern they're in
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
the things we have around us now um the
 
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
known impacts from these and again this
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
is just a I didn't cherry pick the data
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
and the impacts I'm citing these are
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
cited again and again
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
infertility sperm count in the United
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
States and other developed countries has
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
declined by over half these things are
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
called the diseases of the developed
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
world and infertility is a major problem
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
impaired nervous systems we're seeing
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
more and more people with learning
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities coming along and it's a
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's a you know tragedy um and maybe an
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
unnecessary tragedy to happen cancer
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
many cancers are triggered by chemical
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
additives and now cancer is among the
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
top cause of death in children for among
 
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.389 align:start position:0%
top cause of death in children for among
for

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
disease so that's problem 3A problem 3B
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
the toxins keep going again they
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
contaminate the food in our Plastics
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
especially recycled Plastics um and even
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
the baby food like I cited before toxics
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
contaminate the food chain so that when
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
people come to New Hampshire for our
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful fishing and our wonderful
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
wildlife and so forth and they eat those
 
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
fish they eat the wildlife we want to
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that those things are sa those
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
animals and are safe for them for people
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
to eat toxics contaminate our leech fill
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
land our landfill leech Ates so we hope
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
that our landfills don't leak but we all
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
know first of all the leech a that we do
 
00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:27.079 align:start position:0%
collect from landfills has to be the
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
treated for these accelerated very
 
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to handle toxics when we put
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
more toxics into the landfill the leech
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
at toxics go up the landfill right near
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
my house TurnKey landfill seven of the
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
10 test Wells had pfass in them I mean
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
there just all the time and now all that
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
has to be treated in advanced ways so
 
00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:50.839 align:start position:0%
these are expenses that we are paying
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm paying for my City's tip
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
tipping fees because the landfill has to
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
treat its Lee to this advanced level I
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
mean it's the cost keep going um if the
 
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
landfills leak then Heaven only help us
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know now um uh problem number three
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
three 3C chemical recycling spreads the
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
toxics and forms new toxics so here's
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
how it works the advanced recycling or
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
chemical recycling facility begins with
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
a mixture these eye popping containers
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
that probably are using some metals and
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
other interesting U maybe toxic
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
chemicals to make this such a bright
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
color fabric uh like this carpet that's
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
all plastic this material that came in a
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
in a in a um balance so that my husband
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
bought at Target um all these things are
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to get put into the hopper in a
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
chemical recycling facility and out
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
comes well during that during that re
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
reaction a lot of these chemicals get
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
collected but also new chemicals are
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
formed some of which we know as serious
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
toxins and 140 different ones by the way
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
um and some of which we don't even know
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
the names of yet because we haven't had
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
time to study all this then the products
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
from that are condensed into either of
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
two products into actually two products
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
Plastics and fuel in New Hampshire that
 
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
fuel can and be allowed to burned within
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
the facility that's our law for new for
 
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling allows that fuel from
 
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
this process to be burned within the
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
facility if you want to burn it
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and sell it and burn it
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
elsewhere then that's not called
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
Advanced recycling that's just called
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
paralysis and waste incineration both of
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
those processes are now allowed in New
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you want to sell the
 
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
Plastics out of this then those Plastics
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
go on and become a desirable product and
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
here's a bottle that I found as waste as
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
a road trash in front of my house it
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
advertises 100% recycled
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
plastic that's a lovely concept however
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
if this recycled plastic is that
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
recycled plastic I don't think I want to
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
drink this
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
water because I don't know what will be
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
it has come from all this other stuff I
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is furthermore that
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
plastic is turned into recycled plastic
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
toys so do I want my one-year-old
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
grandson do I want him to be chewing on
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
this I don't think so so we have we have
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
to stop and say these problems
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
associated with under
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
regulated weight
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
B cannot continue I know you can say
 
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
well this is expensive it's complicated
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
but this is too important to um just
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
wait for further decisions we can take
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
charge of this and that's where I want
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
to get to my
 
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.230 align:start position:0%
to get to my
Solutions

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
so the solution the New Hampshire nhpr
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
can begin to limit the toxics there are
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
less toxic Solutions available for
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
example the um BPA was removed as soon
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
as we found out that it it impaired your
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
reproductive abilities and had some
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
cancer effects and so forth they came
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
out of the bottles and no bottle cost
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
anymore the manufacturers didn't have to
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
pay much for this because the chemists
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
could easily figure out a pathway to
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
produce these bottles without the BPA
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
that was just one problem so safer
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
packaging will create jobs here's an
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
fantastic opportunity from from for our
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
state we have so many waste wood feature
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh resources here because of our our
 
00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
active um um Timber industry there's a
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
lot of waste wood we also have act
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
active agriculture that will have waste
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
agricultural natural materials all those
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
natural materials are
 
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.190 align:start position:0%
natural materials are
nontoxic

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
nontoxic
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
packaging this could be packaging
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
production Central for non-toxic
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
packaging and we just have to you know
 
00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:28.839 align:start position:0%
continue to develop that industry it's
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
starting but we can develop it more here
 
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
our um nhbr is our next is our is the
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
next step you can open up to take um
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
we've already started with the the band
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
toxics in metals of 96 we can keep going
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
we can look at Main's epr they're smart
 
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
and granite Staters I think are just as
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
smart as the
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
Mayers so we can ban major persistent
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
toxics the be the past and heavy metals
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
we we can restrict health hazard
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
chemicals such as the phalates and the
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
BPA and so forth they have a very
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
concise way of phrasing it in the in the
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
law there we can they allow in the law a
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
very clever option here to either add or
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
remove substances from the banned or
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
regulated list so it stays updated and
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
this allows industry and scientists to
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
work together to solve the problems of
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
um um hazards in our in our life and
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
then it will can also limit the toxics
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
in recycling feed stocks so that this
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
material that has questionable
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
chemistry will not go into the recycling
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
pathway um and therefore what comes out
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
of the recycling pathway will then be
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
safer safe in safe
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
out so moving
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
on um the benefits um we let's just look
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
at in the past we took lead out of our
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
fuel we took lead out of our paint and
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
now the gas over that transition the
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
gasoline didn't cost more our cars still
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
and trucks still ran very well and our
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
now our paint and our homes is so much
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
safer and we don't have to pay in our
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
lives in our children's health um from
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
lead paint we can move on and um be safe
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
in our in our homes um another benefit
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
is this uh map here of the United States
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
showing you the wide spread you heard it
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the previous testimony the wide
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
spread of epr laws across the United
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
States many states have different kinds
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
of epr legislation and if we don't begin
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
on this then we will be behind in being
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
able to have our products sold in those
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
other states because we will have a
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
reputation that says don't buy from New
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you won't meet meet the other
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
State's regulations so all those
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
businesses are going to say sorry you're
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know we we'd rather do
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
business with a com with a state uh a
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
company in a state that has better laws
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
already on the books and we know what
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
they're doing we we can we can trust
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
what those other states are doing so the
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
industry benefits from no toxics and
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
packaging Forbes Magazine is a great
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
article about green certification boost
 
00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
sales over competive s a huge amount so
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
when an industry says it's green it's
 
00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:33.559 align:start position:0%
non-toxic it's sustainable um in its
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
practices they get more business not
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
less um hypertherm is a great example of
 
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
that um their policy to cut toxics at
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
all stages simplify their operations and
 
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
increase their sales um municipal waste
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
budgets we've heard a bit about this but
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
I can't underestimate how important this
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
is um less toxic Packaging means more
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
sales to recycling markets so that when
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
we have our transfer stations take the
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
carefully and um labeled and properly
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
arranged recycled materials aluminum
 
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
glass especially you know those easy to
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
easy identify ones perhaps some of the
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
Plastics when they identify those and
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
they know that they're non-toxic then
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
they can sell those to markets at higher
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
prices and those sales differences are
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
substantial so now that helps my town
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
budget and helps my taxes stay as low as
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
possible um we can save with the ReUse
 
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
of non-toxic and food service so when we
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
have a business that would otherwise
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
have waste materials in in takeout
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
materials instead if they shift to reuse
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
they would get a benefit from that that
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
would be part of not paying any
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
stewardship fees for having waste
 
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
materials but the bonuses that Simply
 
00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
Having the reusable materials actually
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
saves them 2 to
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
$22,000 per year depending on how big
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
the restaurant is so the restaurant is
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
saving money twice once by not having to
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
buy the stuff in the first place second
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
not having to buy a potential
 
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
stewardship fee and then now they're
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
really in in good States so the
 
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants should like this um process
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
um now now we can move on to another
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
benefit confident companies every one of
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
the companies that I've shown you on
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
this picture are small companies it's
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of the laws and the
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
regulations and the limits for for um
 
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
Commerce for and budgets in each one of
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
these these companies but they do way
 
00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
way under a million dollars of business
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
under a 100,000 for some of them so
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
they're probably not going to be
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
impacted by the a number of bills
 
00:45:56.829 --> 00:45:56.839 align:start position:0%
depending on how the the bill is
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
structured but here's the advantage that
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
they gain from having epr in New
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
reputation in a business reputation
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
means so much more and it really counts
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
for for their personal value but it also
 
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
counts on their their bottom line and so
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
having New Hampshire as an epr State
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
improves the reputation of all of these
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
companies because they sell online Way
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
Beyond New Hampshire
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
and also within New Hampshire these
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
other um other things is having an epr
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
Bill signals the packaging vendors that
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
each of these people has to call up and
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
say I need so much to put in my my bone
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
meal broth from I love Vernon Family
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
It's a Wonderful Farm um but when they
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
want to buy a bunch of packages they
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
can't negotiate with this company about
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
what's in your package what's in your
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
container they want to buy from somebody
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
that they know they can trust and when
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
they say oh I'm you're selling to New
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oh yeah we we got it covered
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
we sell to New Hampshire we sell to all
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
the epr states because we know what you
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
guys expect and we're going to give you
 
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
a good price so that's how they can make
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
their businesses more efficient um for
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's personal care products
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
t-shirts you name it you know they're
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to get a good deal um moving on um
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
confident consumers when we shop in New
 
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.430 align:start position:0%
confident consumers when we shop in New
Hampshire

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
and we're buying New Hampshire made
 
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
things New Hampshire packaged things we
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
will be confident whether we have a
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
little baby in the bin or whether we
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
have you know we're we're out there you
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
know shopping for ourselves um and also
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
when we're shopping online and remember
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses do a lot of
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
online um um market and we want to be
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
able to advertise that market of safety
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
and reliability
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
online um so some special features in a
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
smart EP are these are almost near the
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
end here um it will have special
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
considerations for those small
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
businesses that I I just described a few
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
minutes ago they don't have a lot of
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
resources to verify the packaging
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
chemistry and sources to track the
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
packaging fate so I'm pretty sure that
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation will have considerations
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
for very small businesses so that they
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
don't have to um um you know bear a huge
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
burden of this but they can actually
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
generate from the advantages um of um
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
having this reputation as being a state
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
that's protective um they would reward
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
businesses by already using green
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
packaging that are least toxic reusable
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
natural materials easy to compost and
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
safe to recycle there are businesses um
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
such as some of those personal care
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
products I cited earlier and some of
 
00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
those other Farms that I've cited those
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
people have already done their homework
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
they have already gone as sustainable as
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
you possibly can so they should get
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
reward rewarded for that they took it on
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
the chin to do it just because it's the
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
right thing to do now they can get a
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
financial reward for that or you know
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
generally benefit from it
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
overall so in conclusion um yeah in
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
conclusion I say first of all we are
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
paying extra for packaging we're paying
 
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:18.799 align:start position:0%
for too much packaging I now have to buy
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
one of my do green bags to put all this
 
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.069 align:start position:0%
one of my do green bags to put all this
stuff

00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
in another bag another $10 you know each
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
week to put this stuff in something um
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
so already I'm paying too much for too
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
much packaging and in terms of my body
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
and my grandchildren's bodies we're
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
paying too much in toxics all right I
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
showed you that the statistics are
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
frightening um so epr is a way that we
 
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
can begin to solve these problems won't
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
do it all but we can begin it's a key
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
part of the healthy economies because it
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
will cut waste it will significantly cut
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
down roadside waste 70% roadside waste
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
reduction in in epr um States it will
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
cut the toxics in our lives and it will
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
save us then many costs for ourselves
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
and our
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.589 --> 00:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
listening and thank you for your very
 
00:50:16.599 --> 00:50:17.789 align:start position:0%
listening and thank you for your very
informative

00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:17.799 align:start position:0%
informative
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
testimony are there questions yes please
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you Mr chair thank you so
 
00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
much for that really
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um slideshow um my
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
question is I know that you have a deep
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
background in this um
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
realm knowing that there are six other
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
states who have
 
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um epr laws some of them
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
about to kick in of those states have
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
you taking a look at at any of
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
them they are there any that you know
 
00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:58.839 align:start position:0%
because the states are wildly different
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
you know the E the economy of um and the
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
constituencies of California are you
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
know wildly different from New Hampshire
 
00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:11.799 align:start position:0%
um but Maine our neighbor we have
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
roughly the same
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
population uh same climate same um
 
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.109 align:start position:0%
population uh same climate same um
consumer

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:22.839 align:start position:0%
base there's also New Jersey who who do
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
you think is a good model for where New
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could look for guidance on
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
developing our
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
own EBR thank you so much for the
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
question um Senator I have only had time
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
to look at Mains so I will I have not
 
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
had a chance to do a cross check on the
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
others and I
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
would think that there is time in a um
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
if we were to develop legislation
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh there is time and there's more
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
expertise for fine-tuning the
 
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
legislation but if you look at the
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
Main's law I can actually I would I can
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
include I will update my slide to give
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
you the
 
00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:13.789 align:start position:0%
you the
exact

00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
exact
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislative number with too little you
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
know the exact legislative item in Maine
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
and you can read you can read it's 21:45
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
so got it up here I was wondering your
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
analysis of it yeah right and it seems
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
it seems very straightforward and it
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
seems like it has has been successful I
 
00:52:31.789 --> 00:52:31.799 align:start position:0%
would have to you know I can't speak for
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
the Mayers but um that one is easy to
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
understand easy to read uh
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
practical I would start there um but I
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
would just start there but I again I
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
would say we have enough to
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
write practical legislation that's
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate for New
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have enough now to to write
 
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.829 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have enough now to to write
that

00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.359 --> 00:53:08.349 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
um I have
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
no we don't typically take questions
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:53:14.359 --> 00:53:16.309 align:start position:0%
from the
floor

00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:18.630 align:start position:0%
floor
um

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
sorry yes if you'd like to
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay um but I do have a question
 
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.589 align:start position:0%
okay um but I do have a question
MH

00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
MH
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
um I'm more concerned about the
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
toxic components of some of these waste
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
that may may have previously been
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about Could you
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
um do you think an epr legislation would
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
effectively cause us both manufacturers
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
and consumers to take a harder look at
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
what we are putting on our landfills
 
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
knowing our past uh history of sometimes
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
overlooking these type of
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
things I think we have to be um I think
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
epr legislation and the charge of this
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
committee is focused on taking the
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
toxics out at the
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
start of the
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
process um and so you're dealing with
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
the water going into the bathtub your
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
keeping toxics out of water going into
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
the waste bathtub per se um in
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
epr and that will keep the drain of the
 
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
bathtub of waste you know from having
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
fewer toxics in it unfortunately the
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
landfills have Legacy toxics in them so
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you
 
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
to work on other legislation associated
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
with land fill toxics and so on
 
00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.950 align:start position:0%
with land fill toxics and so on
however

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
controlling what goes into recycling
 
00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:05.630 align:start position:0%
controlling what goes into recycling
feed

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
feed
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
stocks is critical and limiting how you
 
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.430 align:start position:0%
stocks is critical and limiting how you
define

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
define
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
recycling is critical in an
 
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:17.720 align:start position:0%
epr because if it's not carefully
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
designed and carefully limited and I
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
believe I don't know if I'm sure but I
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
think Maine has something about safe
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
recycling least toxic recycling
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
something about that because if you
 
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.109 align:start position:0%
something about that because if you
don't

00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
Define the nature of what you mean by
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
the word Recycling and recycled content
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
then we end up with this bottle coming
 
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.870 align:start position:0%
then we end up with this bottle coming
out

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
mess if you don't Define it this is what
 
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
get because this is the easiest path
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
who want who wouldn't want to just dump
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
this into a bin and have something that
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
looks like plastic smells like plastic
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
but is much more than just plastic um go
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
into this recycled
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
content and then we say we've done our
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
job we did not do our job because we
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
didn't take the toxics
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
out as feed stock for plastic
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
recycling does that help that does help
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
very much thank you so much thank you
 
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.510 align:start position:0%
very much thank you so much thank you
further

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you for this
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
very uh I I got to say that I there are
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
points that I have not considered before
 
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
such as um alternative packaging being a
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
growth industry for New Hampshire these
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
These are exciting and potential ideas
 
00:56:43.599 --> 00:56:53.870 align:start position:0%
These are exciting and potential ideas
thank

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:57:13.470 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:17.559 align:start position:0%

good morning good morning thank you
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partiall and uh
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
name is Cindy Heath and I live in
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
Cornish New Hampshire um I am the
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
convenor about three years ago of the
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Network Plastics working
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
group and um the working group is a non
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
partisan all volunteer organization
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
founded in 2021 to help reduce plastic
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
waste and pollution in New
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I also volunteer at the
 
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
Cornish recycling center during the
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
winter months so I get to see firsthand
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
the waste management practices in my
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
town which is very
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
informative and my professional
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
background includes Community planning
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
and most recently providing technical
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
support to municipalities in the Upper
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
Valley who want to implement food scrap
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
diversion programs and I before I begin
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just build on something that
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
Cynthia um mentioned in her excellent
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
testimony and I have looked at the main
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
law epr law and and some of the other
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
companion laws not very recently but one
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
of the things that really impressed me
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
about Main's work in this area is that
 
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
they have a very extensive list of what
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
they call chemicals of
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
concern and given what was mentioning
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
about turning off the flow at the tap um
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
that is their entry into how to define
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
what types of chemicals can go into
 
00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:10.039 align:start position:0%
packaging that is sold in Maine I don't
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
know if it's part of the epr law but I
 
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
know if you were to look um for
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
reference at chemicals of concern in
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
Maine you would see a very long list um
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
and that is a uh comprehensive way for
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
the state to Define what goes into the
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
packaging that's sold in
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
Maine so the Plastics working group

01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
posos in carpeting clothing Upholstery
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
and food packaging so this is well
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
documented in our Solid Waste plan uh as
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
a recommendation and finally goal number
 
01:06:58.589 --> 01:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
three is to maximize the diversion of
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
residential commercial and Industrial
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
solid waste from
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
disposal and so evaluating mandatory
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
recycling laws and epr programs is one
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations for legislation
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
in that goal so there's plenty of
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
support for the committee to move ahead
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
with um advancing this towards a
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
legislative review um in our existing
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
approved current Solid Waste Management
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.589 align:start position:0%
approved current Solid Waste Management
plan

01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and finally um there's a
 
01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation to explore product
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
stewardship and epr programs for a
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
number of other items including Plastics
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
and some of the other items that I
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned which are further described uh
 
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the written
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
testimony according to the product
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
stewardship Institute there are
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
approximately 100 epr policies across 33
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
States as of 2022 so we know that the
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
epr legislation is
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
Broad there's more than enough data for
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
policy makers to draw from to develop
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
legislation that works for us in New
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these policies focus on 15
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
different types of products including
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
products that are difficult to recycle
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
like Electronics paint carpet mattresses
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
fluorescent lighting product packaging
 
01:08:12.559 --> 01:08:14.109 align:start position:0%
fluorescent lighting product packaging
and

01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals we know New Hampshire
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
can do better um we know that epr means
 
01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
less waste and less toxins in our waste
 
01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.430 align:start position:0%
less waste and less toxins in our waste
stream

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
stream
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
that reduces potential harm to Citizens
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
and the environment especially children
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
we know that epr can help save dollars
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
for our communities and I would just ask
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
you before I close to think about your
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
own recycling center or transfer station
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
in your town and how it might benefit
 
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
from extra funding to do things that it
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to do now and I know in
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
Cornish that is a significant challenge
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
for us we want to do better but
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
financially it's very difficult
 
01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
in closing I urge the committee to use
 
01:08:59.070 --> 01:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
the information that's readily available
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
from existing Global and state epr
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
experiences to recommend the submission
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
of epr legislation in this session We
 
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
Believe New Hampshire businesses
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
organizations government and individuals
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
are ready for this important step in our
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
state and can effectively work together
 
01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
to protect the health of our citizens
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
and the environment we call home the New
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Plastics working group stands
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
ready to assist in any way the committee
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
believes would be beneficial
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
to advance your knowledge throughout the
 
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
legislative process thank
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to see if anybody else
 
01:09:47.789 --> 01:09:47.799 align:start position:0%
would like to come forward at this time
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
please fill little pink card at your
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
conven I don't need it right away but
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
make sure before we're conclude here
 
01:09:53.759 --> 01:09:56.750 align:start position:0%
make sure before we're conclude here
thank

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you so
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you I will be brief uh for the
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
record my name is jod grimus I'm a
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
lobbyist here in conquered and I work
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
with the American chemistry Council in
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
which there's a Plastics division um I
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of kind of the focus
 
01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
turning uh as it did today with a lot of
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
the testimony on the Plastics community
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would ask um I just
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
received a copy of a potential draft
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that I think is
 
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
based on New York and Maine which there
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
have been concerns about from the
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
industry um I know I had spoken to the
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
chairman about potentially coming
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
forward and bringing someone in to talk
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
from an industry perspective um but we
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
had kind of thought it would be more
 
01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
about advanced recy cing and then that
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be part of it but I
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
would offer that I would like to have
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
that opportunity I don't know if you
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
have any more meetings in the future or
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
if it may be waiting till next
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
legislative session but I do think
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
um as as the prior speaker said there's
 
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for people to work
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
together here and industry has to be
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
part and at that table and I don't know
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
if that's the case and I think it should
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
be so I would make that offer I'm
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
certainly not the expert in those matter
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
matters but I would at least bring them
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh to this committee or to Future
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
committees because I think at some point
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
from what I understand in in Maine in
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
New York that hasn't been the case and
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
it hasn't necessarily worked well so I
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
will leave it at that and
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
I let let me know what you
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
think yes thank you for your brief
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
testimony um just a point of information
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps I think that all of us see that
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
this has to be a cooperative effort from
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
both industry the producers and the
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
consumers and this is our opportunity to
 
01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
reset the unspoken rules that have
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much governed Us in the past when
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
it comes to our waste flow um however I
 
01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
cannot see uh this being effective
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
without industry having a voice in it um
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
so I would expect that if and when our
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee decides that we would like to
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
continue this discussion I know there
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
are very many organizations
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh the N uh the
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
NR the municipal Organization for New
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire number of organizations that
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
we have because of our limited time we
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
have not been able to call I would hope
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
that if legislation goes before the
 
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
committee we'll have the opportunity to
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
further dig into all of these issues
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
including the issues that you have great
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
seeing on perhaps I can uh once again
 
01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee I'd like to thank everybody
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
who testified today I I think we got
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
some really good
 
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.350 align:start position:0%
some really good
information

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.910 align:start position:0%
information
uh

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
Mr Corson kind of convinced me in a in a
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
sense that um with his
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm my committee is
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
environment and Agriculture and I feel
 
01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
that that maybe my committee should be
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
you know hear some of this
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
testimony but uh
 
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
overall I
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
think I I would like to see more time to
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
to see what happens in main I I would
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
like to I don't see the urgency I'd like
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
to see them let's see so that we know
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
know what happens with all parties I'm
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about that I I uh the advanced
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
recycling law Senate Bill
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
367 I believe has eased up the municipal
 
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
burden somewhat uh I'd like to see more
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
emphasis on on an awareness campaign for
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
both producers and
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
consumers and and I think with with that
 
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
information uh the market approach
 
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
rather than having this forced on on
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
companies uh let the free market
 
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
determine once they've been educated
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
people people may start use you know
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
using cardboard containers instead of
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
plastic or or bringing uh like the
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
chairman has a a container today rather
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
than than have buying a plastic bottle
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know that type of approach using
 
01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.110 align:start position:0%
uh you know that type of approach using
buying

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
buying
 
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
biodegradable uh packaging you know
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
products that use that so so that's
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
this and may I um ask our um respected
 
01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.750 align:start position:0%
this and may I um ask our um respected
uh

01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative do you feel that the
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
discussion and testimony will become
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
before Ena which is most likely where
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
any legislation would go I think that's
 
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
safe bet do you think that will happen
 
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
without us recommending further
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't know I've I've it's
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
come before us already
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
so I I think it will come back yes I
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
think it would come back I think it may
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
take some time to come back because I
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
know of no current legislation in the
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
hopper and the soonest would come back
 
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
2024 however if we do recommend further
 
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and submit it to the OS
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
before November 7th we have the
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to keep to uh ask for
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
further testimony in front of the uh
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee and at the end the ENA
 
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
committee may decide to not pursue this
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
they can always take um uh retain it uh
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
or whatever but I think that just having
 
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
that possibility opens up this issue to
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
keep it uh to keep all of our resources
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
table yes please go
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair so
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect my colleague I
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that history has shown us
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
that the free market approach to
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
handling Public Health has
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
been um wildly unsuccessful and I use in
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
this particular inset in um instance
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
BPA so
 
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.110 align:start position:0%
BPA so
BPA

01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
BPA
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
developed 12 years ago um was used in
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
baby bottles it was used to line uh cans
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
that have our vegetables in them and um
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
other products that we eat and um and it
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
is it is a very very dangerous toxin
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
that leeches out of those products and
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
into human bodies and
 
01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.430 align:start position:0%
into human bodies and
without

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
direction from
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
government we would still be feeding our
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
children BPA Laden bottles now you can't
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
buy a bottle in pretty much any store
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
without finding a a a a sticker or a
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
sign on it that says BPA free which lets
 
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
the consumer know that this particular
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
producer has taken the information that
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
BPA the the Plastics chemical BPA has
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
been removed from this particular
 
01:17:52.639 --> 01:17:53.830 align:start position:0%
been removed from this particular
product

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
and it is um safe for human use so you
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
know this was the this was tighter
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
standards that was you know the
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
government had to put on producers
 
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
because it was much more um profitable
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
nothing so um and once their product
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
goes out the
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
door no they they did not care whether
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
children were you know being exposed to
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
BPA whether we were being exposed to BPA
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
that was of no concern because once they
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
made the product went out the door got
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
sold to a you know to a supermarket and
 
01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
there it's out of my hands out of my
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
hands I'm making money off of it so
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
um this is why this is why it's
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
important for us to with
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
seriousness understand the public Public
 
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.550 align:start position:0%
seriousness understand the public Public
Health

01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
dangers in doing nothing so in not being
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
proactive we ended up here in New
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with um a massive massive
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
amount of P contamination my community
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
in particular because we um have a
 
01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
landfill in our community that was
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
unlined and no one thought like well you
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
know we're not required to do it no
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
body's making us do it it would probably
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
be a good idea but why it costs more
 
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
money now we have leech
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
everywhere subsequently you can't put in
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
a um landfill without lining it because
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
we made a government rule um so it has
 
01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
long long been an
 
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate um
 
01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
byproduct of a free market is to
 
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
concentrate only on profit which great
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's what they do but uncontrolled
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
unregulated free markets um are not free
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's not free because who pays for it we
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
do so we're going to pay the medical
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
bills of the people who are exposed to
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
um bpas and all of the issues that come
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
along with that who's going to pay for
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
all of these massive Plastic Products
 
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
and the Mercury that went into
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
thermometers which the government had to
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
re in who's going to pay for the
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
electronics piling up who's going to pay
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
for all of these products that we are
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
consuming and
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
using we do we pay for them Coca-Cola is
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
not going to pay for
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
them PNG is not going to pay for them
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay for for them um so
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
all this extended product producer
 
01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility concept does is
 
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
bring everybody into the same space
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
of shared responsibility so yes we have
 
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
a responsibility to purchase products
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
that do less
 
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
harm however if there aren't enough of
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
them out there
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of choice how free
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
is that not very so we have
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
already Canada has um has been operating
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
their extended producer
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility um laws since the
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
1990s they have a population of
 
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
38.25 million people so that's the
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
equivalent of 29 New
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so since the 199 90s
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're way ahead of us on this
 
01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
California New Jersey Washington
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
Colorado Maine all of these states have
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
also enacted extended producer
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities because they understand
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
that it is a shared responsibility
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
between the consumers the consumers
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
communities our municipalities and the
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
producers who are bringing products into
 
01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.350 align:start position:0%
producers who are bringing products into
our

01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities um that are not 100%
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
usable there there is packaging and we
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
have to deal with that the total of all
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
those States is 63.3 4 million Consumers
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
Plus the
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
38.25 million consumers so just in the
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
United States we have the um a consumer
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
population the equivalent of 45 New
 
01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.870 align:start position:0%
population the equivalent of 45 New
Hampshire

01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
so um and then most of these most of
 
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
these laws also also take into account
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
the European article numbers which EUR
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
Europe is also far ahead of us on this
 
01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
so product uh producers understand this
 
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
is coming and they would
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
love to not have to do it now because it
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
costs a little more it costs more money
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know it just it costs more money I
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
would love to not have to pay the
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
$250 then it's going to cost to clean
 
01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
out my chimney um because you know it's
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's expensive and I have a car payment
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
and my car is actually doing some funky
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
things so it has to be dropped off this
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
week so $250 is like I really don't want
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
to have to spend that money but I know
 
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
that if I don't spend that money then I
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
am going to have a potential hazard in
 
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:49.790 align:start position:0%
am going to have a potential hazard in
my

01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
house and I haven't taken care of of it
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
so by not participating in extended
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
producer responsibilities we're
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
just postponing the hazard and we all
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
know when you work with a municipal
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
project and you put off doing the
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
municipal project it never gets less
 
01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
expensive absolutely not never gets less
 
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
expensive so we have an opportunity
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
right now to participate with the
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
producers to find a space that works the
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
best for us here in New Hampshire and we
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
we are not making it up other there's so
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
many other states countries that have
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
already done this and have data for us
 
01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.550 align:start position:0%
already done this and have data for us
already

01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
so I think we can we can all agree that
 
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
we have some very toxic chemicals
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
already floating around in our
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
watersheds um and we have you know shut
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
down some things that had been putting
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
air pollution into our communities and
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
before this gets more out of hand we
 
01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
need to make a good faith effort at
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
joining with producers to figure out how
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
they can be responsible for what they're
 
01:25:07.629 --> 01:25:07.639 align:start position:0%
coming in and how we can join them in
 
01:25:07.639 --> 01:25:08.550 align:start position:0%
coming in and how we can join them in
that

01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility so um I would propose
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
that we particularly take a look at um
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
the New
 
01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.430 align:start position:0%
the New
Jersey

01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
Jersey
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
proposal um I think there's a lot of
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of the New Jersey epr that would
 
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
um that we could we could actually pluck
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
out that would be appr appropriate for
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and also look at so main
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things they did was put
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
together um what are they calling it a
 
01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:42.119 align:start position:0%
um sustainability office and the
 
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
sustainability office um from from the
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
the read I have of it from the
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
legislation operates very similarly to
 
01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.910 align:start position:0%
legislation operates very similarly to
our

01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
EFA office so it's a contract so the um
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
sustainability office um gets is a a
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
contracted vendor if you will from um
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
and the money to sustain that comes from
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
um responsibility money from the
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
producers that coming in and that helps
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
to manage the
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
program so that's just a tiny overview I
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
know there are a lot more details than
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
that but I do think that there are some
 
01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
models that we we would be it would be a
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
great great benefit to New Hampshire to
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
look at these before um it costs us even
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
more money with pollution
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
mitigation because that I promise you is
 
01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.189 align:start position:0%
mitigation because that I promise you is
more

01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:55.629 align:start position:0%
more
expensive

01:26:55.629 --> 01:26:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.639 --> 01:26:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
you my thoughts on this are that I would
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
like to see this issue stay alive I did
 
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
I did share with you a
 
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
draft piece of epr
 
01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.430 align:start position:0%
draft piece of epr
legislation

01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
and I do not see that as a final answer
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
but I do see is something that would
 
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
come before the ENA committee to keep
 
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
the conversation alive to keep us
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
I feel like I've had a tremendous
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
education over the last three weeks here
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
and I would like that opportunity to go
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
before the ENA committee as well so
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
I um I would really hate to think that
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
the report that I've been uh
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
commissioned to draft would be the final
 
01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
word for a couple years I would much
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
prefer it seeing it as one step forward
 
01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.950 align:start position:0%
prefer it seeing it as one step forward
that

01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
includes uh recommended
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
legislation uh that I can't imagine
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
would would I I I have to image would be
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
seriously uh amended but at the end
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
all be able to equally like or dislike
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
something for everybody um that's not
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
going to happen if we bury this right
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
now in a report so I strongly Advocate
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
moving forward submitting legislation to
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
OSS and getting this before the ENA
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee so that we do not have to wait
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
another year to attack our waste flow
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
problem um I will also add I don't know
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
if you've noticed in the uh legislation
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
that I uh drafted that um there's no
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
mention of advanced recycling there's no
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
mention of bottle bills there's a
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
mention of toxic substances all of these
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
would have to be negotiated and all
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
these would have to
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
be uh considered with more mins than
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
just my own if we're going to going to
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
have something that works for everybody
 
01:28:58.030 --> 01:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh I strongly recommend uh um and we do
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
have a a quorum here today and I think
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
we need to be appropriate to take a vote
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
on whether or not we do want to submit
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
legislation to ol in this matter
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
um so as I am serving as clerk as oh
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
please go
 
01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
ahead ask a question yes thank you Mr
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
chair so um are you are you making a
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
motion to to adopt this language with
 
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for rewrite or as is like is
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
there an once it's
 
01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
submitted are you submitting as is or
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
with opening that 10day space
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
for for editing if there's other
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
information can I just say
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
yes I'm I I am open to either um I
 
01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
really think that either way is not
 
01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
really significant because this is more
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
of a door stop or a bookmark than it is
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
an actual finished product um so I would
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
be more than open to either frontloading
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
it before it goes to L us if comments
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
are to be made or submitting it and
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
letting uh it come before Ena and then
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
the Senate and having it decided there I
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
I could go either
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
direction um and I would welcome your
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
that um I I was told earlier in this
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
committee that that this was
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
formed this committee was to look at uh
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
saving the burden to in and saving money
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
to the towns by reducing uh the amount
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
of of waste that goes into the
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
landfills uh and I I've heard so much
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
more than that today about what toxicity
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
at I mean that I really honestly wasn't
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
aware of some of the stuff I heard today
 
01:30:59.950 --> 01:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
but uh I think we're getting off a
 
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
little bit from what the topic was
 
01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.550 align:start position:0%
little bit from what the topic was
originally

01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.470 align:start position:0%
originally
and

01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's where I'm at with
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
that should I add that my original input
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
on what this bill was to um because my
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
own landfill or transfer station was was
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
self- sustaining and being able to
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
recycle the plastic was coming into it
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
until the plastic Market collapsed and
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
now they're talking about significant
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
increases in my own Hometown so reducing
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
Municipal costs is very dear to me and I
 
01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
think that is addressed somewhat in the
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
draft legislation as well um the
 
01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.629 align:start position:0%
 
today

01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
is only increases
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
my ear urgency to see something passed
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
not just for the uh Financial aspects of
 
01:31:58.270 --> 01:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
it but for the environmental aspects of
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
it um does that answer
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair um and I'm
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
happy to provide a little clarification
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
um because our in our um in our charge
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
our study extended producer
 
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a mechanism for
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
meeting the waste reduction goals
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 149 m so um when we
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
look at the waste reduction goals of 149
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
M um one of those original goals was to
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
divert at least 40% of solid waste from
 
01:32:37.629 --> 01:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
disposal by the year 2000 and
 
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um we don't have we have
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
not met that um one of the other goals
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
in RSA 149 m is number one source
 
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
reduction reduced a generation of waste
 
01:32:51.159 --> 01:32:52.310 align:start position:0%
reduction reduced a generation of waste
diversion

01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
diversion
 
01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
recover discarded resources and avoid
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
disposal and then disposal landfill or
 
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
incinerate items that can't be reduced
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
or diverted
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
so the you know
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
um in fact there is a chart of on 149 M
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
which is an
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
inverted pyramid that shows this is the
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
most preferred method and the most
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
preferred method here is source
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
reduction so which is what we're talking
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
about here and the least preferred
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
methods to meet the goals of 149 M are
 
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.590 align:start position:0%
methods to meet the goals of 149 M are
landfills

01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
incineration uh and waste to energy
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
those are you know in that order um with
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
the least of course being landfills
 
01:33:44.109 --> 01:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
because now we have heard today that
 
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
unchecked landfills and overburdened
 
01:33:48.669 --> 01:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
landfills particularly when we don't
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
even know what's coming in from out
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
other states um gives us a lot of toxics
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
that we end up having to deal with again
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
that costs us a lot of money so um
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
Source reduction Recycling and reuse and
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
composting is right in the center but
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
the most preferred for RSA 149 M was
 
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
Source reduction which what is our
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
charge um with this committee is to
 
01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do some Source
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
so um you know this this program that
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
highlights and breaks down RSA 149
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
M um you know underlines that's that's
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
what we're that's what we're here to do
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
and we have other bills that are still I
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
know one of them stuck in finance right
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
now but we do have some other groups
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
within the legislature who are working
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
on a addressing the prospects of
 
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
chemical recycling um which is its own
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
we got a little taste of it today of
 
01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.709 align:start position:0%
we got a little taste of it today of
um

01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
from uh Cynthia who you know just gave
 
01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
us a little insight into it but that's
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's well beyond the scope of this
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee and there's actually other
 
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
committees who are working on that right
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
now like this not this moment but in
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
this session um so you
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
know if we stick to our
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
charge and go straight from the statute
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
and T possible targets for epr include
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
packaging single-use Plastics beverage
 
01:35:38.189 --> 01:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
containers electronic waste batteries
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
automotive waste and hazardous waste and
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
use those if or a couple of those to
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
input into possibly this proposed
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
legislation from representative parcel
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
that um we have a we we have a
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
solid F to stand on and bringing
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
something forward and we have met the
 
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
objectives I think um given the very
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
limited scope of House Bill
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
253 um because we have you know met all
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
of the other criteria
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
so we're we're down to number five of
 
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:27.310 align:start position:0%
so we're we're down to number five of
hb250

01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
three I could return this one moment
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that more eyes you asked me a
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
question earlier what I want to see
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
further drafts before it's SP to ol or
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
after I almost think that at this point
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
maybe further eyes on it and further
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
testimony May well hopefully will make
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
um I would like to that's try to get a
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
straw poll here I think I know how you
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
feel do you feel like may be appropriate
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
at this time to submit further
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
legislation to keep it in front of the
 
01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:15.629 align:start position:0%
legislation to keep it in front of the
committee

01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.229 --> 01:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
process okay and how may I ask be very
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
Frank how do you think it will come up
 
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
you said something in
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
finance I think that was Advanced
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
recycling though that was in finance no
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if there was some confusion in
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
my um explanation this is the only space
 
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
where we're really dealing with the um
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
Extended producer responsibility some of
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
the other topics that have come up that
 
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
are out of the scope but that have come
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
up here um are being addressed in other
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
committees so my my statement was that
 
01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
some of those things that are out of our
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
scope are being addressed but within our
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
scope there is nothing right now which
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
is why we're here um
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
to s in fact we are charged with
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting possible legislation and or
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
rules for implementing approaches that
 
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
would be readily adaptable to New
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and may propose topics for
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
even further study so we are charged in
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
our statute to suggest possible
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that is that's just what
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's what was signed by the governor
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
so um to meet the go to to meet Our
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
obligation uh we have we have
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
done Parts
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
one we have almost finished part two we
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
have done
 
01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
Parts three four and we are not done
 
01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:49.830 align:start position:0%
Parts three four and we are not done
with

01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:38:52.030 --> 01:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
five so
 
01:38:54.990 --> 01:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
so um it I don't know that it's an
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
option not to bring something forward
 
01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
because it was not put as an
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
option so we have to suggest
 
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
something which is why I asked if
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
representative parcel would be open to
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
any changes to what he has proposed
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't I didn't bring a
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
proposal for today um but I would like
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
to participate in
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
any of the redraft because you know what
 
01:39:26.109 --> 01:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
comes forward out of this committee is
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
so would you support it with a
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
redraft I I guess I would like to see
 
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
education to the consumer things like
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
that I at least put you know I'd like to
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:40:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
concerns

01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think the draft was was kind of
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
one-sided I I know uh representative
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
bruad had called me and he has the same
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that I do I I can't speak for
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
him but
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
um oh
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
yeah like the Senate has said I I don't
 
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
know maybe we have to put something
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
forward here but I just want my concerns
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
noted in your report I guess I certainly
 
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate to have all the
 
01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
concerns noted in the report and I would
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
not think other I mean I hope you know
 
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
that I would not consider otherwise
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
however I going back to uh five
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm also really feeling
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
have a a bill
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
that passed the house and consent passed
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
the Senate and consent and I see both
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
these as a real hunger to learn more
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
when it comes to education to learn more
 
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
on the behalf of both of on of on the
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of the
 
01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:08.679 align:start position:0%
legislature um I think consumers have
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
had quite a bit of time to educate
 
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
themselves and I think if you look right
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
now there's even an effort well I've
 
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
seen Delta Airlines a lot lately and how
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to be carbon n by 2050 um
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
I think there's real effort in education
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
consumers from the standpoint of
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
Industry um I think it's the legislators
 
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
that might benefit from further
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
education which is why I would love to
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
see something go forward and maybe could
 
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
I ask could we work together because I
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
did not see this as one-sided of course
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
but it is my perspective I don't deny
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
that could we work together in order to
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
come up something to uh satisfy our
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
I believe so
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so while we're you know while
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're digging into this where um because
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
we can do some of this work right now
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
where are the spaces uh within the
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
propos within the proposal that are that
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
are giving you our bur so that we can
 
01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:15.639 align:start position:0%
like you know maybe maybe we can talk
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
through some of these right now um to be
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest representative partial
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm I am not able to see an
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
education like a consumer education
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
component is that we're talking about
 
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
is I have not um I controlled off my way
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
through this and can't find it so is
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
that something you would be open to
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
um packaging reduction organization
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
which sounds very similar to the way
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
Maine came forward that um I know in
 
01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
Maine an education piece for consumers
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
is part of their
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
process um that is some of the charge of
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:30.270 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
okay Vermont calls theirs the
 
01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:33.350 align:start position:0%
okay Vermont calls theirs the
Stewardship

01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
Stewardship
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
Council but very much the same it's just
 
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
you know whoever the separate entity
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
is so yeah are there's what are the
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
specific spots that maybe we can um dig
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:52.229 align:start position:0%
specific spots that maybe we can um dig
into

01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
I just I'm I know in this room there's
 
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
an urgency for this I'd like to see how
 
01:43:59.709 --> 01:43:59.719 align:start position:0%
it plays out in Maine for all parties I
 
01:44:03.149 --> 01:44:03.159 align:start position:0%
I don't see the urgency in it um I think
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
with with education we live in a a free
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
market Society I think that I I really
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
believe that if if people were educated
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
instead of uh getting a plastic bottle
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
of water you'd bring a container from
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
home I think you'd buy the cardboard
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
package container instead of the plastic
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
I I think you might buy something that's
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
packaged biodegradable let the let the
 
01:44:28.109 --> 01:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
market determine that I I believe
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
that'll if people were educated I
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
believe that would would help I I just
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be forced on
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
producers and let's let's find out what
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
Maine's doing Maine would be the closest
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
one to us I I I don't think New
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and New Jersey are would would
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
be a Fair Fit I don't think California
 
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't be I think Maine
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
would uh I think Maine is a close to New
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I that's what I'd like to
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
see is is let it play out a little bit
 
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
and see how it affects all
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
parties um okay I I'm sorry Mr chair may
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
I respond thank you um thank you thank
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
um I do want to bring back into this uh
 
01:45:12.589 --> 01:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
this discussion that
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
we that our free market economy is not
 
01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
entirely free in fact we have a
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
significant number of regulations about
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
how certain products um can be made and
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
sold we for instance you know measure um
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
how how much um non-flammable material
 
01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
goes into products that go on our
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
children and when we had you know
 
01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
recognized that these
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
non-flammable components of children's
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
pajamas were actually poisoning them um
 
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
we as the government stepped in and said
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to do that anymore
 
01:45:55.470 --> 01:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to take that out
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
same thing with BPA you're going to have
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
to take that out when um you know when
 
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
cigarettes even used to be unfiltered
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
and before we really wrapped our brains
 
01:46:08.910 --> 01:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
around the fact that you know smoking is
 
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
something that actually kills you we you
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
know put filters on you know we have
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
done incremental things to make our
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
communities our citizens and our
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and our environment safer we have
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations about how much
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
toxin you can spew in the air that's why
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
we have a Environmental Services
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
protection commission you know we it's
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
not a free-for-all it's a it it is a you
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
know monitored space um and so you know
 
01:46:43.589 --> 01:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
which is why we have health regulations
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
for restaurants um we don't let the free
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
market rule our public health and when
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
we do it we end up suffering which is
 
01:46:58.109 --> 01:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
how um you know which is how we came
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
across the fact that pasas has been
 
01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
poisoning people all across my community
 
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
the maram community I know you have a
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
colleague in the house who has um pasas
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
related cancer uh so it it's there it's
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
happening we have to deal with it
 
01:47:22.510 --> 01:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
and so it's not a free-for-all we we get
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
to make some we get to put the bumpers
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
on this Lane and the question is what
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
are the bumpers look like there can't be
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
no bumpers because without any bumpers
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
then we're just paying for it in our
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal tax bills we're paying for it
 
01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
at the state level so we're going to pay
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
for it all of it so we want to share the
 
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
cost that's it seems you know the longer
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
we wait the more we pay and I quite
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't I don't want to keep
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
paying for somebody else's you know
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
laziness or you know profit
 
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
margins because we're not asking them to
 
01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
do what they are asked to do in other
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
states and in Canada like they're
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
already making these products for other
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
people but we don't get them because
 
01:48:13.229 --> 01:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for them so this is
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
this is where I want to just make sure
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
that we're all on the same page about
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
there being bumpers on the free market
 
01:48:21.790 --> 01:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
you know I I understand that totally and
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
in the things you're talking about are
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
the products themselves and the safety
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
of the products this and and we're
 
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioned I believe for the packaging
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
to make less of it go into the landfills
 
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
not not to make the products themselves
 
01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
safer am I am I wrong in saying that the
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
pro the packaging is the
 
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
product that is all part of the product
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
about flammable uh clothing for children
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
and that's not the packaging that's the
 
01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:51.639 align:start position:0%
product that's
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
s okay
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
um my apologies for not having a more
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
specific um my my intention on using
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
that as an example is to demonstrate
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
that we have government spaces where we
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
can we can in say to producers of
 
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
products and packaging is a product um
 
01:49:17.709 --> 01:49:17.719 align:start position:0%
that you can't put this kind of
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
chemicals into these products so a
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
better example if we want to be if we
 
01:49:25.709 --> 01:49:25.719 align:start position:0%
want to stay uh with Fidelity to the
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
pack to the issue at hand is BPA inside
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
of cans where you get your corn beans
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
green beans garbanzo beans soup where we
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
were buying baby bottles and baby
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
bottles you don't you know it's a rare
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
occasion to buy one they come in big
 
01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
packs and those were Laden with BPA
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
until we stepped in and said nope so now
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is all of the
 
01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
plastic and all of the packaging that
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
goes on those improved products you know
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
about big jugs
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
of uh laundry detergent we're talking
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
about um metals that come in our
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
Electronics we're talking about paint
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about all kinds of things
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
so recognizing that the
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
product so we uh are speaking if we do
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
submit and I'm just going to go ahead
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
with this you know assumption for the
 
01:50:45.149 --> 01:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
moment here we need to have something
 
01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
more about education within this
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
situation yeah okay um how do we get
 
01:50:58.830 --> 01:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
that in there do we work together you
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
and I the three of us or would you like
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
me to just take that on I think Maine
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
has something like this we could model
 
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:07.719 align:start position:0%
it somewhat after Maine yeah I I think
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
that you have some strong feelings about
 
01:51:13.069 --> 01:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
how what it would look like for the
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
education component um and who pays for
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
that like you know is it is it something
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
manufacturers you know pay into a state
 
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
fund is it something that is part of
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
their own marketing campaigns there's
 
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
all ways of figuring does the state take
 
01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
this on like who does the education what
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
does it look like um and you know would
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
you be open to you know figuring that
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
piece of this out while during the
 
01:51:44.109 --> 01:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
redraft I'd rather leave it in your
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
hands I'm happy to either and I would
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
like to submit it to if your approval
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
though and we should at least have some
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
discussion on it I want to make sure
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
that it meets your you know uh like to
 
01:51:57.149 --> 01:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
try to be fair of course we're all have
 
01:51:58.990 --> 01:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
our own perspective you know can I point
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
out one other thing I think is might be
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
somewhat relevant I don't have the
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
feeling right now that we really are
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
dictating to the industry to the
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
producers in so far as many of The
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
Producers just about all the producers
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
we have heard from have endorsed the
 
01:52:18.069 --> 01:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
idea of at least beginning the process
 
01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
of EPA legislation
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
I think they're doing that because they
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
see it as a it's on the horizon for them
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
already with so many other places
 
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:31.719 align:start position:0%
and they realize that it's just a matter
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
of time here and they would love to have
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
a seat at the table so they are
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
endorsing this and I think that's a very
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
positive thing to have them on board
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
with it and I would sincerely like to
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that and the other
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
thing which really strikes me off very
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
heavily is that when it comes to paper
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
and what color and we know what color AO
 
01:52:52.589 --> 01:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
dead they increase their recycling rates
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
to for 23 to
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
70% I think that's an amazing uh and I'm
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
sure they did that with some
 
01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
education um but it
 
01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.149 align:start position:0%
education um but it
also

01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:53:08.069 --> 01:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
gave the consumers something to work
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
with just like this legislation here I
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
know it's been difficult for the people
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
that come and testified because we don't
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
have any legislation in front of them
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
and they're used to having legislation
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
in front of them this is study committee
 
01:53:22.589 --> 01:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
but if we get legislation in front of
 
01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
them we can have these different groups
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
come in and say we like this we don't
 
01:53:29.709 --> 01:53:29.719 align:start position:0%
like that and it'll be it will encourage
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
a deeper discussion than I think what we
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
W able to have here and also more
 
01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
relevant to a broader number of people
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
who already support the concept of vpa
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
VPR um so that's my thoughts right there
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
um may I go ahead and uh start drafting
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
education and what else are there other
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
areas or areas we might want to remove I
 
01:53:58.750 --> 01:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
I'm also open to that I think that
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
anything we do may be further amended
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
down the line so I'm very open to the
 
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
whatever we need to this to get this on
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
to the next
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
step Mr chair please thank you um with
 
01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
regards to what we heard from Miss
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
grimas um there is actually
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
documentation from the American
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
chemistry Council um on their working
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
with California and they have outlined
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
the objections that they had in the
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
process so we have you know we we have a
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
document here that says this is where
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're struggling you know so I mean that
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
information is not unknown so we we are
 
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
we do have that so that's you know one
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
thing we can factor
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
into our document because we know where
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
some of the producers are coming from um
 
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
and where they're struggling with so we
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
want to be able to be
 
01:54:59.159 --> 01:55:02.350 align:start position:0%
want to be able to be
cooperative

01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
partners and I also know you've been
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
taking very copious notes today and if
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
you'd like again to draft them into
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh very often these reports also have a
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
Minority Report element to them and I
 
01:55:26.669 --> 01:55:26.679 align:start position:0%
would certainly welcome that or if you
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
want to incorporate it in the regular uh
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
report I'm happy either way on that
 
01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:33.719 align:start position:0%
whatever you would like to go
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
that but I but I really do think it's
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
important we hear all these voices and
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
we continue to hear them so what I'm
 
01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
gathering right now and correct me
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
please if I'm wrong um and I hope I'm
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
not uh if we are able to redraft this
 
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
legislation this proposed legislation
 
01:55:56.109 --> 01:55:56.119 align:start position:0%
that OLS has not even seen yet um but if
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
we're able to redraft that to something
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
that does include something about
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
education and perhaps some other issues
 
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
then we can go ahead and submit this and
 
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
knowing that it will probably be even
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
further amended by Ena or whatever
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee it's assigned to are we pretty
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
much in consensus on that do you feel
 
01:56:19.149 --> 01:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
yeah and would you mind if I if I could
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
email you just a like a small Report
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
with my concerns
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
and add that into it more than mine I'd
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:35.960 align:start position:0%

01:56:40.510 --> 01:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
um did you put a number on it okay
 
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
accept the proposed legislation that
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
came out of this summer committee um an
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
act to require companies selling
 
01:56:55.069 --> 01:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
offering for sale or Distributing
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
products contained in packaging to
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
minimize consumer packaging by
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
prescribed goals set by the New
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%

today but for not the foreseeable future
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%

01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
