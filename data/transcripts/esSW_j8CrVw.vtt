00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
question Senator uh gray is Rec for a
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
question um since uh we have in hb2
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
clarification there was some controversy
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
between the department and the senate
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
about uh what was going to be done
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to get to an update since we
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
25,000 um Scott Mason executive director
 
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fishing game um yes
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
Senator uh this what we're asking for is
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
$25,000 which will be the contractual
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
amount for the supplier for the software
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
um we have had a couple of minor
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
setbacks um we have been working with a
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
company called S3 and they have been
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
purchased by a company called pay it and
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
that did slow down the the process in
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
between the the renewal contract and the
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
new contract um the I think the good I
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
think this is actually a good thing for
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
us um S3 was a company that only dealt
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
with fishing game issues licensing
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
um hunting lottery stuff like that um
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
pay is a bigger company that does other
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
types of work including automobile
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
registration so I think that they
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
actually bring some new skills to the
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
table for us and I think it'll actually
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
be very helpful on this particular item
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
um the other issue that has taken place
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
um the uh employee that was in charge of
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
our licensing and registration
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
um um section uh has has retired and we
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
have have just recently replaced her
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
with a new employee and um we believe
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
things will be moving a little quicker
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
now that we have uh that change over in
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
place um I think the big issue that
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
still lays ahead of us is when we get
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
into uh fulfillment uh we will probably
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
need to hire an additional employee um
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
one of the issues with online
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
registration versus our um our historic
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
registration system that relied upon
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
agents the agents supplied the labor to
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
fulfill you know to hand over the
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
registration um here fishing game will
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
be be in that process obviously on
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
online these folks won't be standing in
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
the office we'll be having to mail that
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
out so we are anticipating the need for
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
um an additional employee when we get
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
there at this time we do believe that we
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
will be on target for September 1st 19
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 2025
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
deadline further question uh and that
 
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
will include both uh renewals and new
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
registrations yes
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
sir thank you further questions from
 
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.829 align:start position:0%
sir thank you further questions from
committee

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
members want attain a motion to dispose
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
and did he say September
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
25 yes
 
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
I believe that's that's the deadline in
 
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:34.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:36.590 align:start position:0%

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
right okay if we can't move any faster
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
than that we're in
 
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
trouble we've been talking about this

like forever and and now we we we find
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
out person who was there is gone we have
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
to replace that person we may need
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
sense to me is is what I'm saying here
 
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
we we we've talked about this and now
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
we're talking about two years and uh our
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
our goal was to expedite
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
this I thought anyway that's that seemed
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
to be the the conversation that was
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
around this table the last time we met
 
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
let's get it done right now uh now it's
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
off until 25 um as I remember the
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
conversation at the finance committee
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
meeting um that uh uh by September of
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
2025 uh the old commitment was from the
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
Department was to only have one and I
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
don't remember whe it was renewals
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
online by by then uh and that date was
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
in their opinion
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
not firm okay so right now it is an
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
improvement if we have a firm date for
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
both the new registrations and renewals
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly Senator I would encourage
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
all of us uh to encourage them to uh to
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
improve on that date uh because the
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
Snowmobile Association and a few others
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh are very very very vocal on this and
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh so but if if they can come back with
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
something you know a request that
 
00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
enables them to cut a year off of this
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
or whatever I'm sure that uh both you
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
and I will entertain and do what we can
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
right well I enthusiastically support
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
Expediting the situation I think just it
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
just makes a lot of
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
sense and if I may I didn't know if U Mr
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
Mason wanted to add anything to what I
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
said um no I would just remind the
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee um part of the issues facing
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
the department um we had other
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
requirements that predated the online
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
registration requirement and we have
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
been working diligently on those and
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
what we have done basically is put them
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
in line
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
um we are this is the first year that
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
we're offering online deer registration
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
that has been going very well
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
um we shut down online deer registration
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh twice during the season so that we
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
can collect biological samples of deer
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
coming into registration stations today
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
happens to be one of those days but in
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
the early part of the Season we were
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
running about a 61% online registration
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
participation of our Hunters um so I
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
would dare say that that that has been a
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
fairly successful program um the next in
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
line is to uh change our online
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
licensing program so that if you have a
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
suspended license anywhere in the United
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
States you will not be able to buy a
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire um which
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
Believe It or Not uh for most folks the
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
inability to buy a license is a bigger
 
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.669 align:start position:0%
inability to buy a license is a bigger
um

00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
um penalty than actually a cash penalty
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
that they also receive when they when
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
they do a violation so those are the
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
things that we've been working on the
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
other the third issue that we're
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
currently working on and will continue
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
to work on is we're having to update our
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of our database systems that are
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
no longer supported by the software
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
company so we are in the process of
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
updating 12 of those so that's why we
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
needed some extra time all the different
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
projects that we're doing on on the
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
computer front in the
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%

I I have to say I have some concerns um
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
so so we authorized 21
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
million um in um the house bill for the
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
building of the um Youth Development
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
Center in Hamstead um now we need it
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
looks like we're you're going to need an
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
additional is it 9,000 six or uh million
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
six and a half million six million
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
roughly yes okay um for what
 
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
purpose sure thank you than for the
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
question Lori Weaver commissioner HHS
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
for the record um so I let me this a
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
great question why are we here so back
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
with HB 49 um 21 million and with that
 
00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
legislation came specific elements that
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
needed to be involved in that design for
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
a safe environment and a therapeutic
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
environment so at the time that we did
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
the 21 million as we do with a lot of
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
our projects with DPW we don't have uh
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
an architect on board we do our best
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
guesstimate at projection of cost at
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
that time so given all that we had that
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
was the uh estimate that we're at was at
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
21 million since then we hired an
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
architect when we sat down with our
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
teams of DPW HHS and the architect we
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
realized that what was in scope and spec
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
was going to cost more than 21 million
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
so what the team did um
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
for at least three or four weeks was to
 
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
try to make it work can we make these
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
numbers work can we look at uh we have
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
budgeted and those specs and it just
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't working so then we began to cut
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
um and when you cut you cut space so we
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
did our Cuts as much as we could without
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
sacrificing safety and those components
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day I think the
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
original with the architect we were
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
almost looking at Double the square
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
footage we got that down to 32,000
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
Square ft um as opposed to the I think
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
it was the 25,000 um grow square feet so
 
00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:58.039 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of cuts a lot of but at
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
the same time not sacrificing the safety
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
um component of it so um we don't come
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
to ask with this lightly this is
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
obviously a serious ask we know what was
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
budgeted for it but at the same time I
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
can't tell you in good conscious that I
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
can build a facility that's safe and
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
meets those requirements with the 21
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
million so we looked within our budget
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
of where did we have that we wouldn't be
 
00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
spending general fund dollars to be able
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
to reallocate and working with gopher um
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
and d and and Nathan's team um and
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's where that money is so our goal
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
is to be able to stay within that um
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
there's contingencies built into that as
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
well because we know by the time we
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
start construction we'll be a little bit
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
of time out from now and if you've ever
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
done any construction right now at your
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
house or anything you know that there
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's hard and prices and supply chain
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
and all of that um are challenges so
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we're
 
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.350 align:start position:0%
that's why we're
at

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for that commissioner
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
the other concern I have is seeing that
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
the issues that we've had at Hamad
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
Hospital currently and I know the Youth
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
Development Center is going to be much
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
more is probably going to be much more
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
secure but um based on what I'm reading
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
here the population has
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
changed at the youth detention center
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
now a third are wav to adult status and
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be at the facility until their age
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
of their 18th birthday um a third have
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
been committed to serve their sentences
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
at the facility but then a fourth have
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
gang affiliations all of whom be
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
separated by Sight and Sound how can you
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
guarantee the town of
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
Hamstead that we're not going to have
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
juveniles absconding I'm nervous as it
 
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
is and now we have gang affiliations
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
coming into Hamstead I'm nervous about
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen and the security
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
aspect of the Youth Development Center
 
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.669 align:start position:0%
aspect of the Youth Development Center
in

00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hamstead sure I so we have gang
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
affiliated youth now more than we've had
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
in the past but we don't always have
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
gang affiliated youth but there is a
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
rise in gain activity in our bigger
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
cities for sure um one of the things
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at is how do we um as
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
a state work to make sure we provide
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
resources and try to keep kids out of
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
the system and that's when we think
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
about our Juvenile Justice
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
transformation efforts we've reduced
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's 50% of kids that used to be going
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
into the system we've now reduced that
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
by 50% so what we're looking at for an
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
eye towards the future is we have 18
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
beds can't go above 18 beds we're going
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
to stick with those 18 beds and then
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that kids that don't need to
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
enter that system aren't but they're
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
still getting the care that they need
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise so that's what we're going to
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
be and have been focusing on and will
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
continue to focus on so that the youth
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
that are there or the youth that are
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely required to be there but also
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't languish there I think that's
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
another piece of this when we have youth
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
that are committed it's hard if that's
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
going to be their home for the next
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
three years that's that's a really hard
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
place to be so we're working to make
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
sure that um we don't have kids
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
languishing there that they have
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get Services otherwise
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I would tell you the facility at in
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester is very secure and I my
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
expectation is with the money that we
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
have to do this build that this facility
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
has to be just as secure as
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Edwards for a
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
question uh uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner for taking my
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
questions I I I think I have like three
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
little ones um the because we're in a
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
design phase of the physical facility
 
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
we've I I understand that uh we have to
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
plan on 18 but it's still the case that
 
00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start position:0%
operationally we're anticipating about
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
12 is that is that does that still hold
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
up I think it's really hard to to
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
project out what we're going to have in
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
in three years I know that we had a an
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
average of 12 when we the time the
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
legislation passed that's what we were
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
looking at our census has been higher
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
than that since the spring it's averaged
 
00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:08.350 align:start position:0%
than that since the spring it's averaged
around

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
19 huh okay um followup follow up
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
um when I when I think we started
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
21.6 million for the facility U all of
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
the estimates that we use that you
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
pointed out came internally from the
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
department and and as opposed to
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
Architects um the the initial plan uh
 
00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
was uh to to build a standalone facility
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
and since uh then I think a lot more
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
time has been spent on trying to figure
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
out how to really integrate the services
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
and um and and um and the shared
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
services between the two facilities
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
it's some amount of this additional
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
dollar cost it seems to me needs to be
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
associated with making sure that we've
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
integrated the security systems we've
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
integrated the physical facility uh and
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
those I don't believe were included in
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
21.6 estimate am I mistaken when you say
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
integrate the the security can you be
 
00:29:20.519 --> 00:29:21.389 align:start position:0%
integrate the the security can you be
more

00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
specific it it Okay so we've we've been
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
taking a look at the security at
 
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
Hamstead now we're bringing in a new
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
building uh with with additional kids it
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
seems to me like we have to make sure
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
that there is a
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh security system uh to
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
ensure uh the public safety around the
 
00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:48.519 align:start position:0%
building uh and that um and that we have
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
the hamstad security we have the YDC
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
security but we really need a
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
campus-wide security program and that
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's that to me seems bigger
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
than what what we had anticipated
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
mistaken well I think it would be fair
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
to say that we may not have anticipated
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
how big the need would have been at that
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
time so I think there's an opportunity
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
here to look at the campus as a whole to
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
your point Senator bdel about the the
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
security and the component of it how do
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
we maximize that resource for that
 
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.870 align:start position:0%
we maximize that resource for that
particular

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
campus okay
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
so so in addition to the inflation and
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
the additional square footage um there
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
there are other aspects to this request
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
that are going to make sure that these
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
two buildings are represent sort of an
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
integrated campus environment I is is
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
hear yeah I I in terms of the specifics
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
I think of this money I think it's bound
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
to if correct me if I'm wrong I the
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
bounds of what this money for is for the
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
YDC bill that doesn't mean that we can't
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
have an impact on the campus but I can't
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
take this money here and spend it on
 
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
something for the hospital but if I'm
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
talking about U safety on a campus and
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a piece of that that I'll
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
probably have to consider a financial
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
end from the Hamstead side as well not
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
just the YDC side okay that that that's
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
a good answer um thank
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:28.590 align:start position:0%
a good answer um thank
you

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much so in the budget
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
um somehow an amendment did not get
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
included in the final version of the
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
budget that dealt with hamad's payment
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
in Le of taxes I'm assuming that the um
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
payment has been made yes okay and will
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
be on an ongoing basis yes I believe we
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
have legislation to be make sure that it
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
does get included for this session Y and
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's if I can follow follow up um can
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
you address some of the ongoing security
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
issues um how maybe it's changed at the
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
hospital before we get to YDC I mean I
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
hear some people think it's approving
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
other people say no it isn't but I'd
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
like to hear what you have to say sure
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
so I think this the hospital that the
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
state purchased had a history of having
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
uh clientele that were probably a little
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
bit different than what we have now that
 
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
said since Co we know that mental health
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
has been a significant issue for many of
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
our youth many of our citizens in the
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
state and we've seen an increase in
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
Acuity part of the goal in purchasing
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
the hospital is that we would be able to
 
00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
serve all of those folks that we
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be saying you know you but not
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
you it would be that we'd be able to
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
provide that and at the same time we we
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
took over the hospital we had a
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
transition vendor come in at the time we
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
we had said we were always going to RFP
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
that service but for the startup we
 
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
would do that and I think we've had a
 
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
rocky startup I mean I I don't think you
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
know I'm not going to sugarco quote that
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
we've been clear we've been clear with
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
the town we've met with the town um I
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
think when you look at the data from uh
 
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
we had a rough summer but you look after
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
the summer September October we started
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
to level out a little bit part of that
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
leveling out is our intentional we have
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
leadership there that's uh constantly
 
00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
working with the vendor to say adjust
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
here adjust there this isn't working
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
push and pull all of that and I and I
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
think it's had an impact it's going to
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
be um a constant effort to make sure
 
00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
that the the children are safe and that
 
00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
the facility is um not dis in the town
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
and not an over Demand on the services
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
in the town and we're trying to strike
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
that balance constantly I'm I'm
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
confident we can get there it's going to
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
take us a minute though um so I would
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
like to you know we have an RFP that's
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
going out we're in November Yep this
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
month uh for uh the service for the
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
clinical Psychiatry at the at the Hamad
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
hospital and we're hoping to award a new
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
Vendor by the end of this fiscal year um
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
and and hope to see continued in Pro
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
progress so that by the time we get to a
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
YDC build we're not we're not in this
 
00:33:59.629 --> 00:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
spot right now but we're in it and I I I
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that okay thank you senator
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
blazedale for a question Senator bird

you
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
Regina okay
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
um I I had talked to Dr hanen prior um
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
one one thing I forgot to ask you was um
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
based on the footprint we requested as
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
the commission we had requested to take
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
a look at the footprint uh the design
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
footprint that was going to be on the
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
campus um I'd like to see if we can get
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
uh for our next commission meeting on
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
the 20th if we can get a copy of a
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
portrayal of what the what the initial
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
footprint would have been and a
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
footprint of the additional space to see
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
what what difference the commission can
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
take a look at what difference it it
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
would make sure we can do that thank
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
you um if I may uh procedurally and you
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
know preaching to the choir uh there's
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
two things that Mr Kane knows that I I
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
dislike and that's uh the word
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
retroactive uh but also late okay and
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
certainly I didn't get a copy of this
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
late item until yesterday at the meeting
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
with Mr Kaine it is such an important
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
issue um that you know bringing it to us
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh within 24 hours of you know when
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to to hear it uh certainly
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
is generating a lot of these questions
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
which could have been taken care of
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
ahead of time uh not that you have to
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
comment but just for future uh you know
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge that uh you know taking a late
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
item on a
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
very a topic that is very near and dear
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
to a lot of us uh is not a good idea may
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
I may I comment absolutely I don't like
 
00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
the word late either um I agree with you
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
I think I if we had the choice to bring
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
this and wait till December we would
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
have but we're running out of time given
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
that the money we're using is upper
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
money for this project as you all know
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's timelines and constrictions and
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to work with the
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
architect so the longer we wait the
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
longer we put off the design and the
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
more we put the project at risk so we
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
did not take the request to ask lightly
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
um and we knew that it was a significant
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
topic it would generate project uh
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
questions which is why I'm sitting here
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
right now thank
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
you represent of Earth for a question no
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
my question that took care of it no
 
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.470 align:start position:0%
my question that took care of it no
any

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
yes wner for a question thank
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
you when we were working on the Hamstead
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
budget during the February and March
 
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.390 align:start position:0%
budget during the February and March
last

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
year um something that came up a lot was
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
is that the Staffing there was an issue
 
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
and um they had a lot of vacancies has
 
00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.150 align:start position:0%
and um they had a lot of vacancies has
that

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
improved at Hamstead Hospital yes um
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say that it's in a better
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
spot than it was before but it there's
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
attrition is um steady at many of our
 
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
247 facilities it's hard to um attract
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
and keep staff in those
 
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
positions further question further
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
question so what sort of vacancy rate do
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
you think Hamstead hospital has at this
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
point I don't have that off the top of
 
00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:32.910 align:start position:0%
point I don't have that off the top of
my

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
head it well yeah it varies by position
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
but do we have an aggregate we can get
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
that to you I don't have it okay at my
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
fingertips and one further question F
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
the question so the increase of um
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
square footage that um this item
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
addresses will hopefully address um
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
there is no anticipation here that you
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
will go over 18 children at that site is
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
you um Senor birel further just Dr Han
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong because I just
 
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
did the interm report so the numbers are
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
kind of in my head but when we started
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
the commission and like I said Dr hen
 
00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong um the at least
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
at Hamstead hospital I think the
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
management was at 100%
 
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.670 align:start position:0%
management was at 100%
the

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
um and I think the youth counselors is
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
that what they're YC's are were at for
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
50 to
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
60% are we talking Hamstead or or
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
YDC I think we're talking Hamstead okay
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
because they're at y the YC's are at YDC
 
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
I I think um okay the state has uh we
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
have our leadership positions which are
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
um full except for our CEO which are in
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
the process of of getting a new CEO for
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
the State Side uh they have nurses and
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
clinicians and Direct Care staff so
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
there's different numbers for each of
 
00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.109 align:start position:0%
there's different numbers for each of
those

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
categories I think the the
 
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.270 align:start position:0%
categories I think the the
[Music]

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
um the management I know was 100% And I
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
think the lower Echelon they were
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
looking at um anywhere from 50 to 60%
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate we can get it to you I I I
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to best guest but we can get
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Edwards uh thank you
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it it took me a while to think
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
about it um um but uh I I I think I'm a
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
little concerned that um our census is
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
has has been holding in around the 19
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
level when all the all the trends
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
indicated that 12 would be a good uh
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
estimate for uh future operational
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
capacity and so I I would appreciate it
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
if uh offline or back to the fiscal
 
00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
committee or over to oversight if we
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
could get an update on the numbers uh
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at for the census
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
because uh we we I think we were
 
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
anticipating that in the future budgets
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
when the YDC came in it would be built
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
around uh a census of 12 and so I'm
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
starting to hear that maybe uh that was
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
not a good um planning estimate on our
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
part so so if we could just if I could
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
get some more data if we could get some
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
more data on what's going on with the
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
census I'd appreciate it m Mr ribson
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
used to have some really great census
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
charts and data and so I assume the the
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
new guy has continued to collect that
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
kind of data if I could get an update
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
sure the new gu is here that's soing Mr
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
roacha yeah Mr FL yes all right uh thank
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair I do have a res I
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
do have Marissa was able it looks like
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
at this point we're 7 7% full for the uh
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
for the Direct Care positions at
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
Hamstead and that was a question I think
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
we were going to have a presentation of
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
that at the commission as well it's on
 
00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:10.710 align:start position:0%
that at the commission as well it's on
the

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
agenda may I add
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
something I don't
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
know go
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
ahead um I just in terms of State builds
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to remind folks we're
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
facing some of the similar stuff with
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
the friends at hospital in terms of when
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
did the design and then we had to come
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
back to you and ask for a little bit
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
more money so it's not too off of the
 
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
process that we have to do that but I
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
guess with that I just want to say we we
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
take it very seriously with how much
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
money we have and what are what is the
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
requirement that we have to do that so
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're not building more than what
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
we need to or than more than what we had
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
to and we're and we're taking that um
 
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.750 align:start position:0%
to and we're and we're taking that um
very

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
seriously it's an impressive sized
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
building for 18 people so there's
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
obviously going to be a lot of
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
classrooms and office space actually
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
there will be um minimal office space
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create more of an open
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
concept part of the reason for this
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
space being big is that when we have
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
Sight and Sound separations for youth um
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to have the ability
 
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
to swing and Flex for that so they would
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
be day you know space where they are
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
where they sleep where they eat where
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
they go to school and then where they
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
recreate um and when you have
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions and then when you have
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
gender issues uh separations as well so
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
so that's some of the reason for the
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
larger footprint on that thank you
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
further from the committee I'll move the
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
item I have a comment oh sorry all right
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
well I'll accept the motion from
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%

representative ER I I don't have a
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
question um but I am going to be voting
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
no um because I have the same concern
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
that Senator grey had um this there's
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
really no reason that this shouldn't
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
have gotten to us sooner I didn't get it
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
until today I I realized it was emailed

out yesterday but I didn't catch it um
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why there's you explain
 
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
why there's a rush but why wasn't there
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
Rush a month ago um if was that
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
important you don't need to
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
respond okay have a motion in a second

we're all interested in about the
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
