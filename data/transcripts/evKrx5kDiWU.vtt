members of the committee
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
for those of you who i have not had the
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
fortune to meet yet my name is kevin
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
craig i represent coast county district
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
4 which is the towns of lancaster and
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
dalton and the
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
unincorporated place of kilkini
 
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
unincorporated place of kilkini
so

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
if you will give me one moment
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
my prepared remarks are safely in my new
 
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
notebook right next to the door where i
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
won't forget them but i do have a copy
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:52.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
running for office in new hampshire is
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
famously easy we have a volunteer
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
legislature essentially volunteer
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
as you all know and thank you all for
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
giving your time and service to the
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
people of our state
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
nominations and elections are governed
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
by rsa chapter 655 which i'm sure the
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
members of this committee know better
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
than i do
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
since you deal with it exclusively
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
each of us here today as members of the
 
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
each of us here today as members of the
two

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
currently recognized parties
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
fill out a simple form and pay two
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
dollars that's town hall or city hall
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
it's a trivial process for anyone who is
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
registered as a member of one of the two
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
major parties before the filing deadline
 
00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.070 align:start position:0%
major parties before the filing deadline
closes

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
closes
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
and for those who aren't members of one
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
of the two currently recognized parties
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
it is more complicated they must file
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
nomination papers which means a petition
 
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.070 align:start position:0%
nomination papers which means a petition
drive

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
drive
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
currently rsa 655 colon 42 requires that
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
150 qualified voters sign a nomination
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
paper nominating a candidate for state
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative or a county office
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
executing papers from throughout the
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
state each of those must be on a
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
separate sheet of paper and must be
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
verifiable and verified in order to be
 
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.949 align:start position:0%
verifiable and verified in order to be
counted

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
counted
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
to attain party ballot access and avoid
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
the nomination paper process rsa 655
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
colon 42 roman numeral 3
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
requires 3 percent of voters in the most
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
recent statewide election meaning the
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
total votes cast for
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
president u.s senator or governor
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
this limits access to the minority of
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
potential candidates who are registered
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
members of a major party
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's a disadvantage to those in rural
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
areas that are less densely populated
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i will note that with the coming
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
redistricting coast county loses a
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative we are the graphical
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
county and the least
 
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.110 align:start position:0%
county and the least
populous

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
populous
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
one of the proposed districts will be
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
almost half of the
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
geographical area of coast county
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
putting it
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
almost on a par with a couple of our
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
smaller counties yet we'll have only one
 
00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:09.990 align:start position:0%
smaller counties yet we'll have only one
representative

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire constitution in part
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
the first article 11 states every
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
inhabitant of the state having the
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
proper qualifications
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
has equal right to be elected into
 
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.990 align:start position:0%
has equal right to be elected into
office

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
part 2 article 3 states that we the
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
legislature have an obligation to
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
prevent monopolies by any persons or
 
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.670 align:start position:0%
prevent monopolies by any persons or
associations

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
limiting ballot access is a violation of
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
our fundamental sense of fairness
 
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.190 align:start position:0%
our fundamental sense of fairness
our

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
state motto of seeking
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
fair access and competition fair
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
competition in all things and avoiding
 
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.910 align:start position:0%
competition in all things and avoiding
monopoly

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
monopoly
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
and let me say just for the record i'm
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
not presenting this on behalf of any
 
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.670 align:start position:0%
not presenting this on behalf of any
party

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
i have no plans to run for any party
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
except the one of which i'm currently a
 
00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.750 align:start position:0%
except the one of which i'm currently a
member

00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
i have not coordinated with any other
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
party officials
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
on fully
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
that i ask that you give it favorable
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
consideration and i will take any
 
00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.670 align:start position:0%
consideration and i will take any
questions

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
i have a question oh thank you
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien thank
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question can you tell
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
me a little bit about why you chose
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
to reduce it by
 
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.990 align:start position:0%
to reduce it by
two-thirds

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.269 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
exactly

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
in all of the races so i did cut it uh
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
to one-third of the current numbers
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
because that is a level that they have
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
been at previously
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
every time that
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
an election that results in a
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
third party gaining status
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers get changed
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
and that has gone off and on throughout
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
the years the numbers have been higher
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
they've been lower
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
but i think this is a
 
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
but i think this is a
and

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
readily attainable goal for any
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
candidate who is not a member of the
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
major two parties
 
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.710 align:start position:0%
major two parties
and

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
and
gives

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
much better access and is more fair

could you tell me when this number
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
changed to the current number and what
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
the number was before it became what's

rsas is listed online uh the the dates
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
that it's changed right the dates that
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
which are sort of difficult to follow
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
right so you know so you don't know
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
whether your your decision to go to one
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
third has any actual relation to any
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
prior amount in this statute uh i have
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%

i'm not seeing any thank you thank you
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak to this bill is
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
welcome back representative branch
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
hello members of the election law
 
00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:31.590 align:start position:0%
hello members of the election law
committee

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
tony lebranch and i represent the town
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
of amherst
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
i come before you today to in support of
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
house bill 1149 which lowers ballot
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
access requirements for independent and
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
third party candidates
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
this bill simply gives granite staters
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
more choice when it comes to voting this
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense in new hampshire as nearly
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
one third of our voters identify as
 
00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.629 align:start position:0%
one third of our voters identify as
independents

00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
independents
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
what i often hear from constituents is
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
that people are tired
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the two-party system and they want
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
more options
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
people are tired of voting for the
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
this along with other electoral reforms
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
such as ranked choice voting would
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
increase participation in our democracy
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
and increase representation and with
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
that i ask that the committee passed
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
this bill with an odd pass
 
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.710 align:start position:0%
this bill with an odd pass
recommendation

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative you mentioned that you
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
thought that this would increase
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
participation do you have anything from
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
any other states or this state what
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative craig seemed to indicate
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
that these numbers have changed before
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
um that led to an increase in pop in
 
00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:43.269 align:start position:0%
um that led to an increase in pop in
participation

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh i would say uh a lot of the evidence
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
is mostly uh members of third parties in
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
the state who
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
when it comes to election season they're
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
not able to vote for a candidate that
 
00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:56.150 align:start position:0%
not able to vote for a candidate that
they

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
do support um oftentimes they do not
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
agree with both parties uh so they just
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
do not go out and vote because they are
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
not represented on the ballot and they
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
do not have an opportunity to speak on
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
the ballot as writing candidates
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
statistically have a very low chance of
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
winning thank you
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing none thank you for coming
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on 11 49 is
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
katie gargano from the secretary of
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%

welcome

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
is the red light on
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
there you go thank you
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and members of
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
the election law committee my name is
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
katie gargano and i'm representing the
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office on house
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill 1149
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office opposes
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is lowering the requirements
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
for nomination by nomination papers by
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
two-thirds to get your name on the
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
general election ballot
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
the imposed numbers are not fair to the
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
primary candidates who have gone through
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
the full primary process to get the full
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
support of the voters to be on the
 
00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:15.670 align:start position:0%
support of the voters to be on the
ballot

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
we foresee lowering these numbers
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
the requirements would add clutter to
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
the general ballot and the existing
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
requirements in the law for nominations
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
by nominating papers is a reasonable
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
amount and has been in place for a
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
number of years dating back to 1979
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
i i did some research in those big law
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tarosian
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you ma'am
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
so when it was on the number required
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
was last changed do you know what the
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
numbers were back then prior to the
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
the current uh number for each office
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
we did not find a date when the numbers
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
were ever changed
 
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.710 align:start position:0%
were ever changed
the

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
the books go back to 1979 when the
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
codification occurred and those numbers
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
quick quick follow-up follow-up so so as
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
far as you can tell then the numbers
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
have not changed from 1979 to present
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
follow up to that if you know there was
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
a reference made in earlier testimony
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
that this number changes depending on
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
whether a third party
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
is successful on getting on the ballot i
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
thought i had heard that
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
as being a trigger mechanism for this
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
number are you aware of that and if so
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
what is that because there was recently
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
a third party candidate on the ballot
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
right i think that that person was
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
thinking of the requirement
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
in a general election ballot if they get
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
a certain number of votes then the party
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
gets to stay
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
on the ballot and i it's
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
currently four percent
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
i believe it's four percent currently
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
um and i believe there's another bill
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
later on today that's asking to lower
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
that right okay thank you for that
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
clarification further questions from
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any and that is the last
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
speaker i have signed up if
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%

the blue sheet
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh there was remote testimony
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%

uh this bill of
i

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
the idea came uh as a result of a real
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
contentious special election uh that we
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
had uh just recently in derry for a
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
state rep candidate uh state rep seat
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
and uh you know the
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
the uh the deception that was uh was
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
used in that uh that election
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's what our founders
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
intended when uh when we put put
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
together our election laws
 
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.390 align:start position:0%
together our election laws
um

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
currently in statute uh
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the parties are allowed to uh
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
dictate if they want to close the
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
election but there's uh
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's no uh
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in statute as far as uh
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
when somebody has to declare and this
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%

representative mcdonald
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
good morning representative love morning
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
um i'm familiar with what you're
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
referring to in the recent special
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
election in derry as you know i was i
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
was involved with that with you and
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
and i was delighted with the outcome all
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
the way through
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
and recognized the problem you're
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
neither the republican party nor the
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
democratic party currently has a
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
majority of voters in new hampshire much
 
00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:26.789 align:start position:0%
majority of voters in new hampshire much
as

00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
both of us would like to have a majority
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
of voters we don't
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
undeclared voters are the lightest
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
voting bloc in the state of new
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they take both republican
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
and democratic ballots and primaries
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
there's been a traditional concern as to
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
how undeclared voters would react
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
if they were restricted in terms of
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
being able to do that is that something
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
you've taken into consideration at all
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
yes i have i've talked to talk to

alliance and what have you when uh you
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
get worse uh you know it's uh it's uh
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%

about let's do this and mess with it uh
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
you know it uh it just lends to to you
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
know deception in elections and i don't
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
think it's any anything that any of us
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
want and uh you know once once people
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
understand that they have to 120 days
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
out and that's a negotiable thing i
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
i just don't want to change that you
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
know three seconds before they grab a
 
00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:29.029 align:start position:0%
know three seconds before they grab a
ballot

00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:29.830 align:start position:0%
ballot

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know um i uh
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think we
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
we've got a guard against you know
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
deception and lies
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%

00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh representative love you said that
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
there was talk about messing with
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
elections on social media did they
 
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.029 align:start position:0%
elections on social media did they
indicate

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
that they were just going to mess with
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
republican elections or both parties
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:51.350 align:start position:0%
that they were
known

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
known
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
known progressives in derry they belong
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
to the the dairy progressive page okay
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're gonna stop this
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
all right okay
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
if there is something specific that you
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
want the committee to consider in
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
regards to social media postings
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
then i want you to
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
um produce it
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
and if we're saying it's a problem for
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
both parties i want examples of both
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
parties i appreciate that there was
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
concern in us in a specific election
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you i have i come from a
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
republican household in massachusetts
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
with a father who was chair of the
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
committee and went to a few inaugural
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
balls just as a side and stopped working
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
for the party when they opened up
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
primaries to undeclared in or i think in
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
massachusetts they might have called
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
them independent voters because he said
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
and this was decades ago
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
because of concerns that you had so
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
this is not a practice that just this
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
state has in regards to undeclared or
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
independent voters being able to pull
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
a primary
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
ticket of any party on the ballot
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
one two three however many there are are
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
you aware of any other states that have
 
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
undeclared ballots that allow
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
the choice of a primary ballot that
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
that have undeclared
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
voters that require registration in a
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
party to pull that party's
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
primary ballot there are 13 states i
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions is that a i
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry i'm not seeing very well
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
um and yeah it was the norm prior to the
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
19 mid 70s or even 1980s to have quote
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
what we call closed party primaries i'm
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
curious about the amendment um that that
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
sets aside federal offices is that
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
because the national parties regulate
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
the primaries for federal office or is
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
it because
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
federal election law
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
regulates that why why is that
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh exception for federal office uh i
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
believe the federal the federal you know
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
the national parties do
 
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.149 align:start position:0%
the national parties do
do

00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
have control over it and i was told that
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
it it just might put a little put the
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
first nation primary in jeopardy so um
 
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know i certainly took that out
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
further questions representative barry
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
a question comment just to clarify we
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
don't allow unaffiliated voters to vote
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
in primaries we actually do not allow
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
that when you when you go to pull if you
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
are unaffiliated voter and you go to
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
pull a party ballot you register as that
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
party you pull that ballot and then as
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
we've discussed in this committee before
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to switch back
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
to unaffiliated uh so it's this is more
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
actually directed to representative
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
meerhead because i do love our
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
philosophical conversations we do have
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
close primaries in new hampshire um we
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
just they operate as if they are
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
may i call my done it
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead okay uh you know that
 
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:09.909 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead okay uh you know that
that's

00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
that is the the premise uh but when you
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
when you can change your party
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
affiliation three literally three
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
seconds before you you take a ballot uh
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's not really closed it's not in any
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
way representative barry was actually
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
referring to the declaration that it's
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
made when you do such a change that is
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
codified enough listen okay i just want
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
to change the law to you know put a
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else with the question
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative ward
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair thanks for
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question you spoke about the
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
founding fathers and the primary do you
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
know how candidates were nominated in
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
the 18th century
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know i don't educate me by the
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
caucus system primaries came in the late
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
19th century and early 20th so i don't
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
registered as democrat which is around
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
twenty seven percent
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
six thousand seven hundred and fifty
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
seven are republicans which is thirty
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
five percent and then we have our
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
undeclared voters which make up over 37
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
percent of our voting population
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
many of our undeclared voters vote in
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
every election but would rather not have
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
their friends neighbors or family know
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
their affiliation so they utilize the
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
change back table and remain undeclared
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
on election day this bill would cause
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
confusion and anger to voters that are
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
turned away because they didn't make a
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
selection 120 days prior
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
i question how if this bill passes
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
voters will be educated in time to not
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise them
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
we should be looking at ways to increase
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
voter participation and not ways to
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
suppress it
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
i would recommend the committee to itl
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and leave our primaries the
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
way that they are
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm open to any questions
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
that is the last
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%

and
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
here i'm presenting 1174 which is a very
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
simple bill
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
it arose
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
after the discussion with some members
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
it's got to do with the purity of
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
elections and this
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
here clarifies where the
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
challengers the whole challengers can be
 
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.950 align:start position:0%
challengers the whole challengers can be
positioned

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
positioned
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh this bill brings the uniformity to
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
towns it says that the poll challengers
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
can be permitted to stand within six
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
feet of
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
ballot counting
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
areas the hand counted ballots
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
valves being uncounted and within the
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
line of sight of any electronic device
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:30.470 align:start position:0%
which is the
machines

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
that's all this bill is doing it's not
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
it's just spelling out the rights of the
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
challengers and specifying the distance
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
they can be
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
positioned at it's not changing anything
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
else in the
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
assignment of the challengers the
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
selection of the challengers
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
compensation of the challengers anything
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
else just their location
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
and this is all this bill is about
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
uniformity clarity
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
so every town knows what they are there
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
to do thank you
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%

current law specify um
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
a distance
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
presently or there's nothing stated you
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
know thank you for the question no
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
nothing stated so this will help thank
 
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:23.589 align:start position:0%
nothing stated so this will help thank
you

00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for further questions no
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
can you turn your mic on
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
on lines four and five and of your uh
 
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.750 align:start position:0%
on lines four and five and of your uh
bill

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
are you trying to set up a distinction
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
between towns that hand count in places
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
that use machines
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
that i see six feet for hand count and
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
all you need is a
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
straight view
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
of a ballot machine which could be 100
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
yards away
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's not the
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
distinction for towns because within the
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
same town
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
hand counting can be done on ballots
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
that don't fit into the machine that you
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
know don't look right the they'll be a
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
mistake in the machine so in the same
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
town both can be done
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
um so it's not a distinction for towns
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's just where the challengers need to
 
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.150 align:start position:0%
it's just where the challengers need to
be

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
so with the machine
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's good enough because you
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be reviewing every
 
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.150 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be reviewing every
ballot

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
but hand counting you want to be closer
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the because the humans decide
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
what the ballot says and the machine is
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
the machine it's just you know you just
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
want to make sure they go in thank you
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
so you are setting up a distinction
 
00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:44.069 align:start position:0%
so you are setting up a distinction
not

00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
i think uh not between talents but
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
between the ballots the way the bell is
 
00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:49.109 align:start position:0%
between the ballots the way the bell is
accounted

00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
accounted
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%

was there a specific
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
issue or incident that happened
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%

incident it it it arose over several
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
different discussions in the
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the last year
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative barry i i can help with
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
that um tangentially representative
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
willem um
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative asked me about this bill
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
it was actually one of the ideas i
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
propositioned to him um and it to answer
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
your question that was not directed to
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
me but was was it wasn't effective you
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
didn't know it um it actually came out
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
merrimack town election special
 
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.550 align:start position:0%
merrimack town election special
um

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
that they were counting the ballots
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
and because of where they set up the
 
00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.390 align:start position:0%
and because of where they set up the
rail

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
rail
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
it was so far away you couldn't see what
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
they were doing um i don't believe there
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
was anything nefarious let me very clear
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
about that um but if there was something
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
to be going on there was no way to know
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
which one was going into which which
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
pile um
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
so that was when
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
the representative contacted me about
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
asking me which which sort of um
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh bills i think the committee might
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
actually have some some tolerance to
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
passing i said this might be a
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable um this might be a reasonable
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
approach to add some transparency
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
election without actually interfering
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
with the operations
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
but to answer your question it was
 
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.390 align:start position:0%
but to answer your question it was
merrimack

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
merrimack
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%

seeing none
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%

good morning madam chair and committee
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
members uh i did not intend to speak
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
today i came to be in support of the
 
00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:09.030 align:start position:0%
today i came to be in support of the
bill

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
however arriving here i've been
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
motivated i guess as i have so much in
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
the past i'm from hampstead new
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire i've lived in new hampshire
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
for over 50 years i've always voted i've
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
always considered myself civic minded
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
and tried to become educated about the
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
situations and the votes that i would
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
cast it is only in the last few years
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
that i have become much more active
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
whether it be supporting candidates
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
running rallies etc i've always been
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
kind of out there
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 election it was the first
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
time and i'm a little bit sorry to say
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
that i volunteered as a poll watcher
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
why did i do that
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
there was such an undercurrent of
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
feeling i didn't quite have my finger on
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
the pulse of it but i was
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
nervous i wasn't confident i felt some
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
angst going on and some things happening
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
in my town of hampstead that i couldn't
 
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.670 align:start position:0%
in my town of hampstead that i couldn't
believe

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
and i thought you know i don't want to
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
worry about this i want to make sure i
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
want to assure that everybody's vote and
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
my vote as well are counted and how can
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
i sit back and complain about something
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
if i am not there if i do not
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know lend a hand more than handing
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
outside standing there with with the
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
signs as i usually did and everything
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
else i also was privileged to be allowed
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
to be in pembroke and i went there day
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
after day after day as as many others
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
did that were allowed to witness the
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
situation there and very impressed with
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
the people that were doing the hand
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
counting etc but also aware of the same
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
things that i was witnessing and seeing
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
in different areas that the visibility
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
is not always there
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that we were denied it
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know to that feeling but
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
we had to ask could you please move
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
could we please see could we please take
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
a camera shot at this that or the other
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
thing it doesn't seem plausible that you
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
should have to do that it should be very
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
obvious as to your question about where
 
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.950 align:start position:0%
obvious as to your question about where
did

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know did something arise that
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
brought forth the need for this that
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
have a shorter distance or be able to
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
see i don't even think it's important
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
that anything had to happen in merrimack
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate if it did but this is
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
about in my standard my feeling about
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
this is to prevent more division more
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
angst you know and the uniformity i like
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
that word uniformity across the state so
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
that everybody feels the same way you
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to feel that you have to move
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
or say excuse me or try to feel or
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
realize as i did at times that i could
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
not see i didn't have full access
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
it isn't about the change it isn't about
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
the party but i think anyone and i
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
respect so much you all you know that
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
you have done and dedicated your life to
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
being in a situation where you help this
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
state to be what it is we have elections
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
whether we are a democrat a republican
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
independent whatever our position we
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
want to be confident that we have felt
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
and exposed ourselves to the truth that
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
we align ourselves with a president or a
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
vice president or our secretary of state
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
or whoever it might be that was duly
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
elected and we are confident in that do
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
we not see and i believe it granted it's
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
just my opinion but i s i think truly in
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
my heart and soul that if you asked
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
every citizen of the united states who
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
may be voted in the 2020 collect
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
election or might be in the future do
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
you trust the elections do you trust the
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
process and whether they be a democrat a
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
republican an independent whatever
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
i really feel at this time in our nation
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
most everyone would say no
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
the democrats think the republicans are
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
sneaky the republicans don't trust this
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
independence who knows what it is but
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
this is something we can do it is one
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
small step that we can take it to me is
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
a no-brainer who would not want you to
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
be a little bit closer to the action to
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
see so you can go back to your
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
constituents your people or your
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
neighbors and say yep it was okay from
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
everything i saw
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
i have one more thing to say i am so
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
tired of a word that i am so guilty of
 
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.390 align:start position:0%
tired of a word that i am so guilty of
using

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
it just
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
it brings tears to my eyes that the word
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
that i have used the most and i'm trying
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
not to do it but here it is
 
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
not to do it but here it is
unbelievable

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
unbelievable
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
my husband passed away i'm a widow and i
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
often say if he came back and i spoke to
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
him and told him what was going on now
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
in this current world that we sit in he
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable i speak to my friends
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
length of time but i speak from my heart
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
the next person signed up to speak on
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i have to tell you
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
that is a tough act to follow
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
i agree with everything that she said
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
and i just want to add a couple things
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
i agree this is not
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
a partisan issue this is not republicans
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
or democrats i have talked
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
to many on both sides of the line and
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
everybody has echoed to me their
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
concerns for election integrity
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
and i've had conversations about
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
concerns about what happened in windham
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
not just in 2020 but
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
for many many many elections
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
our moderators
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
set up
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
the table where they count
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
the votes on ballots
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
that either can't go through the
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
machines or the military you acaba
 
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.910 align:start position:0%
machines or the military you acaba
ballots

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
and they do that 40 to 50 feet away from
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
any meaningful observation
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
and that's unacceptable
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
they will deny that they do this but it
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
happens every single election and it's
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
got to stop
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
now i'm not saying that they're doing
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
anything wrong i'm not saying that
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's any impropriety there
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
but i don't know and what happened after
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
november 3rd 2020
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
with the wyndham election and all the
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
all of the issues there were laws that
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
were violated there were procedures that
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
were violated
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
and we can't have questions about our
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
elections it's unacceptable
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
i've had former i've had many
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
conversations with former secretary of
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
state bill gardner
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
and he agrees
 
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.910 align:start position:0%
and he agrees
and

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's important
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
that both parties be represented
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
when those votes are being counted
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
that's the only way to ensure
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
transparency it's the only way
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
to alleviate any potential questions
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
after the fact
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
so that when they if it not if because
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
they will arise you want to be able to
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
have everybody represented
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
with people there who actually saw what
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
took place and they can and they can
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
quell down
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
and say you know everything was done on
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i just want to
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
point out is when i first read this bill
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh so within standing within six feet i
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
think is very very very important
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing that's in here is the
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
line of sight of the electronic ballot
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
counting devices
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
now i don't think that has been an issue
 
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.630 align:start position:0%
now i don't think that has been an issue
for

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
people across the state i don't know
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
that for a fact but i do know in other
 
00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:15.670 align:start position:0%
that for a fact but i do know in other
states

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
there was ballot there was counting of
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
ballots that were going on
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
where they
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
they were doing that in a separate room
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
they actually put up
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
and blocked windows where people could
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
see in the other rooms i don't think
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's happened in in this state but it
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
has happened in others and if it can
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
happen there we want to make sure that
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
it cannot happen here so i support that
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening to my
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
testimony this is a very important bill
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr eyring questions from
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not representative ward
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just thank thank
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i was just
 
00:49:55.839 --> 00:49:57.270 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i was just
curious

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
curious
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
in your case and maybe that of the
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
previous witness whether you've ever
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
considered working as an election
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
official in your town i've actually put
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
my name in this year to uh to hopefully
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
be one of the people selected to be
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
behind the rail
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i hope that this is passed so that
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
we can make sure that
 
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.750 align:start position:0%
we can make sure that
um

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
the elections are done properly
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
good for you thank you thank you too
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead thank you madam
 
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.390 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead thank you madam
chair

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
is there anything that prevents
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
election officials from
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
allowing people to be within six feet of
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
hand count right now yeah there there's
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's limitations as to who can be
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
but when i spoke with secretary gardner
 
00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:42.870 align:start position:0%
but when i spoke with secretary gardner
his

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
his feeling was that there's no reason
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
why those tables can't be moved up to
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
the rail so even though the law says you
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
can't be behind the rail
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
those tables are set up where they're
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
counting it's not just 40 or 50 feet
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
away they have the machine set up in
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
front of the table you can't see
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
and and when you take into consideration
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
with what happened on november 3rd 2020
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
the machines
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
miscounted the votes for
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
all four republicans and this again i'm
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
just using this as an example
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
i believe in other towns that that
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
democrats lost votes in windham
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
republicans lost votes on election day
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
about 300 votes give or take three votes
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
for each of the four
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
candidates but one of the candidates
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
gained 99 votes
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
that could be a machine issue
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
but you don't know it raises questions
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
we don't want those questions we're the

introductions i hope no one has
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
hb 1197 covers a slightly different area
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
from 1149 that we discussed earlier
 
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.549 align:start position:0%
from 1149 that we discussed earlier
and

00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
my arguments are the same
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
covering the same material this simply
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
changes the deficit definition of party
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
from four percent to one percent i would
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
like to clarify uh
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
that i do not believe and i hope i did
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
not imply that there is any kind of an
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
automatic trigger
 
00:53:22.559 --> 00:53:23.670 align:start position:0%
automatic trigger
uh

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
based on the performance of a of a third
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
party i just want to make it clear that
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
i could be incorrect the secretary of
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
thinks the law hasn't changed since 1979
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
i will
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
accept their
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
historical research on that
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
but i do remember
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
having heard in the past
 
00:53:47.359 --> 00:53:48.230 align:start position:0%
having heard in the past
that

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
changes to the percentages and number of
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
nomination required
 
00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.109 align:start position:0%
nomination required
has

00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
varied by legislation
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
depending on the performance of third
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
parties so i just want to make it clear
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
that i do not believe that there is any
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
automatic trigger thank you for that
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
clarification i probably missed all
 
00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:05.670 align:start position:0%
clarification i probably missed all
right

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
so with that i know that there's going
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%

i don't want to steal any of his thunder
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
on that but i do support his change it
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
is more inclusive than what
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
my original bill is
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative lebranch thank you
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
good morning again members of the house
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
election law committee for the record my
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
name is representative tony the branch
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
and i represent the town of amherst
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
i also want to be
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill and the previous one i
 
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
testified on is that
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
as the uh one of the two independents in
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
this house i want to be
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
very clear that i'm not running for
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
reelection this is not for me
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
this is truly what i believe is the
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
right thing to do
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm not running again so
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
this would not apply to me anyways so
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
with that i come before you today to in
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 1197 which lowers
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
the requirements to be considered an
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
official party
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
i also came with the amendment this
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment improves the bill it increases
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
the ways in which a party can be
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
qualified as an official party and enjoy
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
ballot access that comes with it
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation and the amendment i
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
brought forward is an amazing step to
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
giving the people more choice when it
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
comes to election season my constituents
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
as well as voters across the state and
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
country are tired of the new parties and
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
want change and the opportunity to
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
choose others currently in new
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire from my understanding is one
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
of the worst states when it comes to
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
and i will also share that this is one
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
first bills that the independent caucus
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
officially endorses
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
and with that i ask that you
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
pass this bill with an ought to pass
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh ought to pass with
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
amendment i guess i should say
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
and with that i can take any questions
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative ward thank you
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks for taking
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
my question i just wondered if you could
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
shed some light on how you define
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
the def uh thank you for the question do
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
you mean the definition of a party or
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
political organization like a pac
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
currently uh it says parties should also
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
include any political organization
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh i believe that's a term already used
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
under existing law and the amendment
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
would simply just expand that to include
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
the one difference in in my amendment is
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
it's adding president of the united
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
states to one of the elections that is
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
used to
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
reach that one percent threshold in the
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
bill and also adding that section that
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh if there is a member of the general
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
court that is uh
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
of another party from the other two that
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
it would be an official uh party under
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
question representative lane
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
branch um
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
so would independent then be a party
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
since there's i mean assuming that you
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
were running so that's a political
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
organization and would be a party under
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
this statute i'm just trying to
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
understand it uh
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
currently i'm registered thank you for
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
the question currently i'm registered as
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated i would remain unaffiliated
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
and that is not considered a party
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna work on this a little bit
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
so uh if this were to pass and you or i
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
were to
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
become members of a
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
party such as the rent is too dang high
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
party tomorrow um
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
then that would become a recognized
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
political party in this state
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
that is correct uh
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
the most recent example i can think of
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
is the libertarian party of new
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire when a few representatives a
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
few terms ago
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
switched to libertarian at the time it
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
was a recognized party they had the
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
option to uh become members of that
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
party um
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
but that would make it so that they
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
could continue their ballot access and
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
official party status uh and other
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
parties that could eventually come from
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
this such as the forward party or
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
progressive party of new hampshire
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
further questions representative barry
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
so this bill would
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
if somebody changed parties while they
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
were in office so a republican became a
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
libertarian then the libertarians would
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
automatically have ballots access
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
statewide that's correct may have a
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up madam chairman
 
00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:54.470 align:start position:0%
follow-up madam chairman
so

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
isn't it disingenuous for someone to run
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
as a party and they get elected and then
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
change parties
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
because this would encourage that this
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
would encourage somebody hypothetically
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
running as let's say a democrat
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then getting elected and then
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
becoming a forward progressive whatever
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
isn't that kind of dis are we
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to be kind of
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
disingenuous to the to the voters by
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
basically trojan horsing as a different
 
01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.589 align:start position:0%
basically trojan horsing as a different
party

01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i would say
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
that current statue actually encourages
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
it as
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
we saw you have to run as either a
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
democrat or a republican to get elected
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that party
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
affiliation is something that anybody
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
takes lightly it is
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
part of our fundamental identity as
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
human beings you know
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
people who are unaffiliated are
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated for a reason people who
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
identify as democrats identify as
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
democrats for a reason uh and i believe
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
that everybody should have an
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to affiliate with them
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
the party that they truly identify with
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that libertarians should
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
be forced to be part of the republican
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
party and run as republicans and
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
keep that affiliation i believe
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
everybody should be true to themselves
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
and identify with whatever party that
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
they truly believe in
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe it's disingenuous to
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
the voters
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
to switch parties i believe that's just
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
a reality of the political situation
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative muirhood
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.549 align:start position:0%
 
why

01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
if there were one member of the general
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
court who identified as unaffiliated why
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the label unaffiliated become a
 
01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:30.789 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the label unaffiliated become a
party

01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
that shows up on the ballot in the
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
general election thank you for the
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
question uh unaffiliated i believe by
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
definition means lacking of a party you
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
are not identifying with any party uh
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
when you register to vote if you leave
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
that section of the voter registration
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
form blank you will just automatically
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
be considered unaffiliated
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further question
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
could i have a follow-up question
 
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.470 align:start position:0%
could i have a follow-up question
um

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
madam sheriff yes thank you
 
01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.270 align:start position:0%
madam sheriff yes thank you
um

01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
if if someone were to identify
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
affirmatively as an independent and not
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
and then the word independent would
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
appear on our general election ballots
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
as a separate party what would prevent
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
30 or 40 different candidates for from
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm not sure
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
i understand that distinction you're
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
making but i will speak a little bit to
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
the uh fact of being an independent and
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
would that be considered a party uh
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
as many of you probably do not know
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
other countries do have independent
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
coalitions where
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
to meet ballot access requirements
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
independents form a coalition
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
they probably have nothing in common
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to political ideology or
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
platform but
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
for the ease of access of to the ballot
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
these independents foreign parties i
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
know germany the czech republic is also
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
another one where these independent
 
01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.589 align:start position:0%
another one where these independent
parties

01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
parties
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
they're only parties in the formal sense
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
that they would get ballot access and it
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
would make it easier for independents
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
such as one of my constituents who does
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
want to run as an independent next year
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
to be on the ballot
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
one more i'm sorry to drag this out
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you very kindly
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand what the
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
screening function would be
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
that would prevent numerous candidates
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
from identifying us independents and all
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question as the
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
amendment states it is a member of the
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
general court that must change their
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
party affiliation
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
for it to be identified as a party so it
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with any
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
candidates that will run it says that if
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
this party were to become officially
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
recognized they would get a
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
they would have a state-sponsored
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
primary and they would be an official
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
party just like the democratic party
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
just like the republican party and just
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
like the libertarian party was in 2018.
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and good
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
morning representative lebranch
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
facilitating the creation of new parties
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
risk fragmenting the political system
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
and even lead to a greater challenge in
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
terms of getting things done policy laws
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
and so forth being accomplished
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh in
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
relation to that question i would say
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
to my previous testimony on previous
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
bills such as ranked choice voting would
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
be one option it would be more
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative of the people if we had
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
multiple political parties to choose
 
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.470 align:start position:0%
multiple political parties to choose
from

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
that and my partyless proportional
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
legislation which i introduced to the
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
legislative administration committee
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
an electoral system used in almost every
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
single european democracy where
 
01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.190 align:start position:0%
single european democracy where
people

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
vote for their local candidates and they
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
also mark on the ballot which party they
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
prefer and then that legislature is made
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
proportional to
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
whatever percentage each party got so uh
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm saying
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
this bill in conjunction with ranked
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
choice voting and other electoral
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
reforms would not fragment the system
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
and just lead to a more consensus-based
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
system where negotiation and cooperation
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh are
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
paramount and it would lessen the
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
divisions and hyperpartisanship that we
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
see in our democracy today
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i guess my
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
question is a practical one how many
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
party columns do you think will fit on
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
an eight and a half by 14 inch ballot
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
and what happens if 20 or 30 parties are
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
created by members of the general court
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
for for an election
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh in my
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
experience being a member of this body i
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
not many people have expressed
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
that they would like to change parties
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
or form a new party uh
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
that was not even my intention in
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
leaving uh my previous party um but i
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
think realistically we would only see
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
either one or two
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
that being the libertarian party of new
 
01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:09.589 align:start position:0%
that being the libertarian party of new
hampshire

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
because they have a track record of
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
having members switch to that party or
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the forward party or maybe a new
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
progressive party that would come about
 
01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.630 align:start position:0%
progressive party that would come about
but

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
realistically speaking because of the
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
current system no ranked choice voting
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
no proportional representation
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
these parties
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
realistically speaking would probably
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
not have a chance of winning because
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
that would be vote splitting and vote
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
splitting is an issue
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
that i take very seriously which is why
 
01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.510 align:start position:0%
that i take very seriously which is why
i

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
endorse the ideas of ranked choice
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
voting and proportional representation
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
so that the people of the state the
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
people of this country should be
 
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.910 align:start position:0%
people of this country should be
represented

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
just because you're a libertarian and
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
you have no chance of winning in new
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire does not mean that you do not
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
deserve representation in this body
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
i know in 2016
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
the libertarian party i believe
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
got three to four percent of the vote
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
in the election which would have
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
entitled them under a proportional
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
representation system to about 16 seats
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
in this legislature yet they only had
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
three as a result of switching parties
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
from the republican party
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that three percent of the
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
population four percent of the
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
population goes unrepresented in this
 
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
chamber and that they deserve
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
representation and i don't believe that
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
is a controversial idea further
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions we might have another speaker
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
to deal with the ballot issue
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lebranch also
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%

01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.799 --> 01:07:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
joe

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.760 --> 01:08:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
all right welcome
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone again for the
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
record my name is katie gargano and i'm
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
representing the secretary of state's
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
office on house bill 1197
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office opposes
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
this bill because of the space on the
 
01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:21.910 align:start position:0%
this bill because of the space on the
ballot

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
lowering the requirement down to one
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
percent to retain a party column would
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
require significant changes to our
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
current ballot layout
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
i provided you all a copy of the ballot
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
for the committee to see as an example
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
as you can see adding another column or
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
multiple columns to accommodate the many
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
other parties
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
would not fit in the portrait position
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
and may force the ballot to be either
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
landscape or on multiple pages
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
this will increase printing costs of the
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
ballot and would cause and could cause
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
several formatting issues
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
we feel that one percent of the votes
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
cast is not enough support for the party
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
from our voters
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney thank you for
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment in front of us that
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
amends the proposal to say party shall
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
also include any political organization
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
that has at least one member that serves
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire general court under
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
current state law
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the young
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
republicans the young democrats the
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
committee to elect house republicans
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
committee to elect house democrats and
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
other political groups are noted as
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
political organizations in new hampshire
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not positive
 
01:09:43.199 --> 01:09:44.070 align:start position:0%
i'm not positive
yes

01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes for follow-up follow-up if those
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
organizations are political
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
organizations under the law would this
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
amendment not allow
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
all of those other organizations that
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
are really subsets of the current
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
parties to also be on the ballot if a
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
member chose to run under that ticket
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
and expand it further even more that
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
we'd have a name for multiple
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
organizations as a member you can be a
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
part of multiple political organizations
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
just so you know you are in an
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
impossible situation in a new job
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
between someone who works for the
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
parties in the past and in front of and
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
cannot see the people from your office
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
who are either nodding their head
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to answering or not

hb 1423
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
my plan is to go through them
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
sequentially but if somebody has a
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
reason to change them because there are
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
amendments coming or something like that
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
um i am certainly open to that there was
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%

scheduled for today
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
the first bill is 14 23 before we take
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
up 1423
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
two things
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
one i have scheduled a meeting for the
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
so you will be getting a notice of
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
public hearings and executive session
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
next thursday the 10th
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
we will have session on the 17th
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
there is a rumor we will have session on
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
the afternoon of the 16th in addition to
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
the 17th apparently the 16th will be the
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
state of the state governor formality
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
thing and we do usually meet after that
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure how that is going to
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
go given the location issues we have now
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
but i know for sure session is scheduled
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
on the 17th so we will not be meeting as
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
a committee that week given that we have
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
a session
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
that day so i wanted to cover that we
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
you should also have
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
three amendments in front of you
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh 1 2 10 10
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
1 to 14 42 we received that at the
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 1442
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
and another one to cacr 15.
 
01:32:59.679 --> 01:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
and another one to cacr 15.
so

01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
the first bill is 14
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
14 23
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
this has to do with a fund relative to
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
campaign contributions and expenditures
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
and making an appropriation for it
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
we had a public hearing on this on
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
the 19th of january
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative growing madam chair i
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%

01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%

01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
yes i would madam chair
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
campaign financing has long been a
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
controversial issue at both state and
 
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
federal levels
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislatures and courts have spoken on
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
the issue over time this has produced
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
both limits to contribution and
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
transparency regarding contributions
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
transparency is provided by the detailed
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
reporting that is required of all
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
political candidates and pacs
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding ads that are from time
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
to time placed that attack dark money
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
which i would note are paid for by dark
 
01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:26.470 align:start position:0%
which i would note are paid for by dark
money

01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
we can from our existing laws determine
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
where political money comes from in new
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire we have contribution limits
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
for every level of candidates
 
01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
different candidates in the various
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
races raise different some different
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
amounts of money
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
and that's based on hard work
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
the amount of contacts the person has
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
and possibly influence there's no limit
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
hp 42 1423 provides
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for public funding of
 
01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.910 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for public funding of
campaigns

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
but it does not
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
provide it does not outlaw or prevent
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
any of the private campaign financing
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
that is presently allowed by law
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
while the mechanism for qualifying for
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
public financing
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
is creative in this bit in this
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the approach of this bill it does not
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
and will not inherently make for cleaner
 
01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.310 align:start position:0%
and will not inherently make for cleaner
elections

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
and finally i would say a major
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
reason why i oppose this is it just
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
seems in congress to me
 
01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
seems in congress to me
that

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
the government that
 
01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.310 align:start position:0%
the government that
we

01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
would come to
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
be involved in
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
would pay for us to get here and that
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
just does not seem like the right
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
approach so madam chair i would move
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
this bill itl
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
does anybody else want to speak to this
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
bill representative bergeron
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to vote against the motion
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
of an expedient to legislate
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
this is essentially a voluntary program
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
the candidates have to choose to
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
participate in it
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
the public has to choose to donate to
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
the fund it establishes expenditure
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
limits for anybody that participates
 
01:36:24.719 --> 01:36:26.070 align:start position:0%
limits for anybody that participates
frankly

01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
there are very few state representatives
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
that follow the
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
campaign contribution limits or
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure limits that are provided for
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
them under state law and i'm not so sure
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
very many people would
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
elect to participate in this program but
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
given that it's not requiring state
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
funding to support it it's all done
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
voluntarily by both the donors and and
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
the candidates
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
i see no reason at all not to support
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
the concept and
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
let's see if there are people that buy
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
into the uh idea of a public funded or
 
01:36:56.159 --> 01:36:57.910 align:start position:0%
into the uh idea of a public funded or
public

01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
private contribution program for funding
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
our elections
 
01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:04.950 align:start position:0%
our elections
further

01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
um just representative
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
general question of the committee did
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
this this bill
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
it it did what was the cost it did what
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
was the i don't have it in front of me i
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
apologize what was that speak to that
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
this bill um
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
would fund the the the law with a one
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriation
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
so it would create a line item in the
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
budget for it but would require a
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
further act of the legislature
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
to fully fund it so it would not
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
this system would not become operational
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
as a virtue as a result of passing this
 
01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.109 align:start position:0%
as a virtue as a result of passing this
bill

01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh we had four early bills because that
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
needed to go to other things and i think
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
this was one of them we had
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's why we had a public hearing on
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
one yesterday because we needed to get
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
them out of committee
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
but the fiscal note um
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative barry did
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
i mean i'll be supporting the motion for
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
itl because of what you we don't know
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
how much this is going to cost
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
and it seems to be a a solution in
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
search of a problem at this point
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
this kind of open-ended
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
bookend of you know basically writing a
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
blank check and to representative
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
gruen's point
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
it is deeply disturbing that
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
the people who will be elect that will
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
be using government funds to get elected
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
to then run government will then be
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
making the decisions on how government
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
runs that's that that seems like not a
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
good circle or circular system to set up
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
so that's that is one of the reasons
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'll be supporting itl
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative muirhead one
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
quick comment thank you madam chair uh i
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
i did give
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
specific cost estimates of it um when in
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
my testimony but i don't want to get
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
into those uh details i do appreciate
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative growing's
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
characterization of the bill as creative
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to uh i look forward
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
to continuing our discussions at a
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
philosophic level about this idea
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of what happens today
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um i appreciate the reference
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
to discussions on a philosophical level
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
i will say it is true the prime sponsor
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
of this bill representative porter
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that your chair was on a
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
committee that met over the summer
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
also president in the room i believe who
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
participated and my memory fails me
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
often at this point was olivia's inc
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
and i think that it is an interesting
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
concept but i struggle with the
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
with the problem it is trying to solve
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
not that there isn't a problem but
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
having a consensus on what the problem
 
01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.070 align:start position:0%
having a consensus on what the problem
is

01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
is the problem that we're trying to
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
solve having can any candidate run
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.950 align:start position:0%
regardless of
financial

01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
independence or ability to finance it
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
which raises issues as to whether or not
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
one is financing is trying to get into
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
the game so to speak for financial
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
benefit because there's lots of
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
discussion about people being in
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
politics for financial benefit
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
and our campaign contributions really
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
the wave of where the influence is going
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
to come from in the future
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
given that
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
the reports on the money that went into
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
the last federal election are that there
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
was more quote dark money spent and i'll
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
just say both parties so there's data to
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
indicate one party got a lot more than
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
not the other
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh there's more dark money being spent
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to that
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
we now are treading in the line of what
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in some of our bills here
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
today which is the private funding of
 
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.270 align:start position:0%
today which is the private funding of
election

01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
duties whether it is
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
in pacs that sent much money to help
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
election officials in certain
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
communities throughout the country and
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
that money ended up getting funneled in
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
a particular way
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
or whether it is
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
money being spent to fund election
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
duties such as audits or other things um
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
because then you enter into a whole
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
realm of
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a different question so i come
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
back to what is the problem we are
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
trying to solve and i will tell you i've
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
had discussions with john putner who's a
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
big guy on the campaign finance former
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
federal official federal elected
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
official and i have suggested that maybe
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
federally we should just do it the way
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
we do in new hampshire it's not really
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
pay anybody don't give them big pensions
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
and they won't want to stay long and
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
we'll get we won't we'll get a whole
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
different crop of candidates
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative growing did you have
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
um i i do have a question my
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
understanding from the hearing was that
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh the qualification
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
for receiving state funding was by
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
raising a certain amount of of uh
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
independent donations but once that
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
level of donations had been reached
 
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.270 align:start position:0%
level of donations had been reached
the

01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
big lump of money so to speak
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
was going to come from state coffers
 
01:42:08.239 --> 01:42:10.149 align:start position:0%
was going to come from state coffers
right

01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
right the dollars go out you advocate
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
lane

01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly i'm sure to anybody
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'll vote against the itl but i just
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
i look at this as a campaign finance
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
reform and i think we all have said we
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
wanted that
 
01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:37.910 align:start position:0%
wanted that
and

01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
part of it is you have to take baby
 
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
steps i think and i just saw this as a
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
good first effort
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
to do that and it works in other places
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
and see if it tries to see if it works
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and if it doesn't it
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't and we've tried i just hate to
 
01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:53.830 align:start position:0%
doesn't and we've tried i just hate to
see

01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
us say we want to try to solve some
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
campaign finance issues and then
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
not do anything
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that would just
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
be so
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
well if we passed it it would it would
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
address one of our other representatives
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
who's advocating for further definition
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
on what political expenditures can be
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
used for because it's got a bet it's got
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
further detail in it than the statute
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
does is there any further discussion on

01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have reports
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're not going to make the calendar
 
01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.470 align:start position:0%
uh we're not going to make the calendar
obvious

01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
for next
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
we could make the calendar for the 17th
 
01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:57.830 align:start position:0%
we could make the calendar for the 17th
so

01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
um if we can have those in by monday
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
or if you really want we could adopt the
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
old practice that we don't let you out
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
of the building until they're done
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
but monday afternoon by email to me so
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
we could get them
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the calendar for when we can get them
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
submitted to the clerk's office for
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
wednesday so it could go in the calendar
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
to be voted on on the session on the
 
01:45:20.159 --> 01:45:24.310 align:start position:0%
to be voted on on the session on the
17th

01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
the next and that will be the same for
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
all bills we vote on today monday
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon with the goal of getting it in
 
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
the calendar for
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
the session we have
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
the 17th or 16th and 17th
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
the next bill we have scheduled for
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
executive session is 1482 for ranked
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
choice voting for federal and state
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
offices we have a few
 
01:45:46.639 --> 01:45:47.830 align:start position:0%
offices we have a few
ranchos

01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
ranchos
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting bills this is the
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
one that establishes such a process for
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
the largest number of offices
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
federal and state offices and this was
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
an early bill
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
so that is why if you're wondering this
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
was scheduled and the other ranked
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
choice voting bills were not scheduled
 
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
do i have a motion on 1482
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative terezian thank you madam
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
chair madam chair i make a motion to
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
find house bill 1482 fn in exceeding the
 
01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:21.430 align:start position:0%
find house bill 1482 fn in exceeding the
legislate

01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
is there a second madam chair i second
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
that motion seconded by representative
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
sweeney representative taurosian would
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion yes
 
01:46:28.719 --> 01:46:30.629 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion yes
please

01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
so while this is a interesting concept
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i know uh it's being used in maine
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
and we in fact heard testimony from
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
i believe the assistant secretary shaden
 
01:46:40.639 --> 01:46:41.830 align:start position:0%
i believe the assistant secretary shaden
maine

01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
maine
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
problems with it in my opinion that make
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
it not uh
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
ready to be uh something i think we
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
should do here in new hampshire
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
two of the major items were or or let me
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
back up and say that
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things we heard in testimony
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
was that this bill would help allow
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh or make it more likely that a third
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
party candidate could get elected
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
and in reality uh
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
in testimony we heard and unquestioning
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
that in maine it hasn't made a
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
difference at all so
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is really going to
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
change anything there if we were to
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
adopt it but the other problem i see is
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
we heard maine that
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
they have the vote tabulated within a
 
01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.629 align:start position:0%
they have the vote tabulated within a
week

01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
that won't work in new hampshire where
 
01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
that won't work in new hampshire where
the

01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
the results have to be out
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
that it has to be completed by the um
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
day of the election so that that's a
 
01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.270 align:start position:0%
day of the election so that that's a
problem

01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh further i would say that um
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know i know
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments was to solve uh
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
polarity versus a majority vote
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
well when you have several people on a
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
ballot and let's face in new hampshire
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
with the number of
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
state reps we have you have many
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
districts where you're voting for
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere from
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
two to ten
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
state representatives
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
i am at door knocker when i'm out
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
campaigning and i found that
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
a fairly big percentage of people that i
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
come in contact with
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't even know who their reps are and
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
quite frankly they're lucky if they can
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
in a district that has say four or five
 
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.470 align:start position:0%
in a district that has say four or five
reps

01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
reps
 
01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.430 align:start position:0%
reps
really

01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
have a little knowledge on
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
one or two of them so
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
if we were to adopt this you're going to
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
have many people voting you know down
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
the line for
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
three choices five choices whatever it
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
and really not having a good
 
01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.629 align:start position:0%
and really not having a good
clear

01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
idea it's kind of like rolling the dice
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
well let's let's put this person down
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
for number three i i think it's gonna
 
01:48:44.239 --> 01:48:45.510 align:start position:0%
for number three i i think it's gonna
dilute

01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
dilute
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
the meaning of of somebody really
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
doing their due diligence and
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
in voting for somebody they think will
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
be the best i think at the end of the
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
day you should you should vote for the
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
person or persons
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
that you believe is going to do the best
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
job so
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
for those reasons um
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
the proper thing to do with this bill at
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
this time is finding speed into uh
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
would anybody else like to speak to the
 
01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.510 align:start position:0%
would anybody else like to speak to the
bill

01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron no

i'm i'm going for the red light on the
 
01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.550 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going for the red light on the
mic

01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
mic
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet okay
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
um hi thank you madam speaker i mean
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
madam chair sorry
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
um so to answer
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative trojan's question um
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
the reason i believe the reason that
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
maine allows the of
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
the the you know results uh it gives
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
them a whole week is because they
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
allow three days for their
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh election totals to come in whereas in
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we required to come in the
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
same day so we could do it much faster
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
the machines that the secretary of
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
would use to tabulate the you know the
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
ranked choice part
 
01:49:58.400 --> 01:49:59.350 align:start position:0%
ranked choice part
um

01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
would be very quick they would
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
be very quick so we could probably get
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
the results the same night if not the
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
next day
 
01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:10.709 align:start position:0%
next day
um

01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's my only comment
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
for now thank you
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
does anybody else wish to speak to the
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor which is itl 1482
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to ask
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
i i have uh
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
some interest in the concept of ranked
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
choice voting but
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
mostly for primaries and mostly for
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
primaries at
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh at the federal level and the major
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
state race level um
 
01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:47.589 align:start position:0%
state race level um
i

01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
certainly would be interested in
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
some enabling legislation which we have
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and i just want that
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
noted that
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
i think there's there's some benefit to
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i think it just came to my
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
mind that
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like something i want
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
when i have a candidate that i really
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
want but when i don't really care it
 
01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:11.810 align:start position:0%
sounds sort of interesting
 
01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:16.550 align:start position:0%
sounds sort of interesting
[Laughter]

01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
and i won't say what races are causing
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
me to think that all right any further
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%

01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
i would like to speak to that motion
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
second i second that motion madam chair
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative prudhomme
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
o'brien you're recognized to speak to
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
your motion thank you madam chair
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday we went through some
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
difficult testimony on this bill
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh testimony that in some cases i found
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
to be dripping with
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
a possible violent
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
innuendo related to inaccurate
 
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.270 align:start position:0%
innuendo related to inaccurate
assumptions

01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
assumptions
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
about my previous votes and those of
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
other people on this committee and our
 
01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:19.910 align:start position:0%
other people on this committee and our
motives

01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
motives
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
despite all of that i put that aside and
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
tried to focus
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
solely on the merits of this bill and
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
the bill starts off with a lot of uh the
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
words shall rather than may
 
01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
words shall rather than may
and

01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's we it says that we shall appoint a
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
third party to conduct the forensic
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
audit we it shall be completed by
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
october 1st it shall a report shall be
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
given detailing the findings
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
and we're also told that it will be free
 
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers due to private donations
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
but with the word shell if we were to
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
we have to do it
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
and if the money is not raised then
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's just a wish the private donation
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
and the fact that this would be free
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
then be happening
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a risk to take that i
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's quite quite a bit of to
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
ask of the taxpayers
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh there is also an independent third
 
01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
party that would be conducting this
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
audit but how would that person be
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
chosen and i think that is another uh
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
situation that could cause a lot of
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
turmoil and unhappiness of the people
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we heard testimony from yesterday
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
if my recent experience is to be a guide
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to put into motion the
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
audit that will
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
find and explain discrepancies and voter
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
data ballot data and tabulations
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
but we
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
we consider these very serious issues on
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
this committee and we work very hard to
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
avoid them
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
in my own community of derry in 2016
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
i saw that many state laws were not
 
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
being followed and i i addressed them
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
and in so doing i had to
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
explain each and every rsa every time i
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
talked about it
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
to be accurate enough to affect any
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
change and
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
we did have election monitors in derry
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the next election similar to what is
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
happening in windham in their next
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
election because of the problems that
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
they have had now if we could get
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
perfect people to conduct our elections
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
we would do so
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
but in
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
without having that
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have all of the laws that we have to
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
address these issues and i hope that we
 
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
can do them moving forward
 
01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:45.679 align:start position:0%
i checked with the secretary of state's
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
office about any specific complaints in
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
the days after the election in in
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
three twenty twenty
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
if there were any presidential election
 
01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:56.709 align:start position:0%
if there were any presidential election
um

01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
candidates that that spoke to him about
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
problems that they had had
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
and there were none there were no
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
complaints that came to that office
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
about that that election and that would
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
bend the way to address this
 
01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:15.589 align:start position:0%
bend the way to address this
appropriately

01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.189 --> 01:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
so i agree with uh secretary scanlon
 
01:58:19.199 --> 01:58:20.550 align:start position:0%
so i agree with uh secretary scanlon
that

01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
a statewide audit is not necessary and
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
it would not be the way to address some
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
of the the serious concerns that we have
 
01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.669 align:start position:0%
of the the serious concerns that we have
about

01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
specifically windham again
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i did read that whole report i was
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
up late last night i finally got that
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
report yesterday and i i was up late
 
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
reading it but i don't see how this bill
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
would address all of them moving forward
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i'm voting itl but
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
that does not mean i do not care about
 
01:58:45.189 --> 01:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
the issues that were so passionately
 
01:58:45.199 --> 01:58:46.830 align:start position:0%
the issues that were so passionately
described

01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
described
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday thank you representative
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
prudhomma brian for that is there
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wants to speak to this
 
01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:54.790 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wants to speak to this
motion

01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:58.629 align:start position:0%
motion
representative

01:58:58.629 --> 01:58:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
well um
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
i will be voting uh
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of the itl
 
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
some uh items were brought up that
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
um are a little troubling to me
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe this is the vehicle
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
to to solve that
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
um i think going forward we need to look
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
look forward not look
 
01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:23.830 align:start position:0%
look forward not look
back

01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
but having said that i may be able to
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
support uh one of the other bills that
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
addresses this that does a sample um but
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
to just spend the time
 
01:59:33.679 --> 01:59:34.390 align:start position:0%
to just spend the time
and

01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
resources and money to
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
go back and
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
and and open that back up i don't think
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
solves anything what i would like to see
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
us do though is going forward to have
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
the ability to be able to sample and do
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
some audits because
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
in business
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
audits are something that's done on a
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
regular basis to ensure that you have
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
compliance whether they be
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
errors in you know unintentional errors
 
01:59:58.480 --> 01:59:59.910 align:start position:0%
errors in you know unintentional errors
or

01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
something worse than that where people
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
aren't um
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
following procedure and or
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps have a ulterior motive in their
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
there's some wrongdoing so i think going
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
forward we know i think all of us in
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
this room know we have
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
many citizens in this state
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
that are concerned about voter integrity
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
so going forward we do need to in my
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
restore confidence in the process
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
i want to kind of echo what
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative trojan said um i have
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
said in this committee
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
many many many times in fact i think
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
literally the first day we met i believe
 
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
the number one issue facing this body
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
is people's lack of faith in the
 
02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.550 align:start position:0%
is people's lack of faith in the
elections

02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
that comes from a variety of sources
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
it comes from the windham audit it comes
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
from things people say elected officials
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
things that they said
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
it is time to look forward
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
there will be an audit bill that comes
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
before this body
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
this body will pass that audit bill we
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
will have forward-looking audits the
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
himself stood i believe it was in this
 
02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.350 align:start position:0%
himself stood i believe it was in this
room

02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
and said he supports audits
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
we have to fix the problem the problem
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
is the lack of faith in the election i
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
said it on the
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
second or third day 33 percent of
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
granite staters are not extremely
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
competent in the outcome of a new
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire election it's unacceptable
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
this bill will not solve that problem we
 
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
know that from the windham audit this
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
bill will not solve the lingering
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
questions of 2022 i don't know if
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
there's anything that we could do that
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
would solve those pro that solve those
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
questions and for my friends on the
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
other side i don't think there's
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
anything that we could do to solve the
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
lingering questions from 2016.
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
what we can do is come together and find
 
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
a forward-looking approach that will
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
restore people's faith
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
in these elections
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
and i'll be supporting the itl for that
 
02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:57.350 align:start position:0%
and i'll be supporting the itl for that
purpose

02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the sponsors they are
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
trying to address
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
a very legitimate concern the underlying
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
problem once again is people do not have
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
faith in the elections i believe firmly
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
that there will be people that do not
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
vote because they do not have faith in
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
the elections and just as my friends on
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
the other side of the aisle are very
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about young people
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
being being suppressed and and
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
and all of that i am very concerned
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
about voter suppression of people who do
 
02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
not have faith in our process this is
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
not the way to fix it this is backwards
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
looking but this body will pass an audit
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill that's forward-looking
 
02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative growing thank you madam
 
02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:39.589 align:start position:0%
representative growing thank you madam
chair

02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
um i i echo what has been said here and
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
i would add that
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
i also believe that this bill does not
 
02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.510 align:start position:0%
i also believe that this bill does not
have

02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the amount of necessary
 
02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:54.629 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the amount of necessary
uh

02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
detail specificity that's required to
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
to perform a good quality audit and i
 
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
also uh in in just
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
i think just common sense would say that
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
it is virtually impossible to complete
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
such an audit no later than october 1
 
02:03:14.239 --> 02:03:16.310 align:start position:0%
such an audit no later than october 1
2022

02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
2022
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
which again is it is i believe a fatal
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
i also
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
firmly support
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
the concept of having regular and
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
routine audits on election
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
on on elections in new hampshire
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
it amazes me it truly amazes me that we
 
02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.550 align:start position:0%
it amazes me it truly amazes me that we
spend

02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
spend
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
many many many times as much money
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
protecting our dollars as we do our
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
votes and i think that's a travesty and
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
i think we do need to do this
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
with my colleague representative
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
terozian i am
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
i am interested in pursuing one of the
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
other bills that would do a
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
smaller look at the 2020 election but i
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this bill is is
 
02:04:05.679 --> 02:04:06.790 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this bill is is
feasible

02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:07.910 align:start position:0%
feasible
uh

02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
to accomplish and certainly doesn't have
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
the specificity
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments from
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%

02:04:39.199 --> 02:04:39.990 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney thank you madam
chair

02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
um i will also be supporting the an
 
02:04:44.069 --> 02:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
i know it's a sense of humor i'll just
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
remind you all we have a vote and that's
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
how we find out how you're going to vote
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
yes yes i
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
i'm aware i'm prefacing my comments
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
um our state did have 15 recounts after
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
the 2020 elections
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
none of the recounts had any change in
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
the election night results from who the
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
winners were versus who the defeated
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
candidates were
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
one of them had obviously the big
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
discrepancy in windham which this
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee took up last year passed an
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
audit bill and proceeded with the
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
process that we incorporated all
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders desires
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
and design for that audit
 
02:05:22.719 --> 02:05:24.550 align:start position:0%
and design for that audit
so

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
i think we can have faith in the new
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire election systems i agree with
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
what representative barry said and i've
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
agreed with what what all the members
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
here have said yesterday during the
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
committee uh hearing on this bill
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
my name was
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
referenced several times by those
 
02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:40.790 align:start position:0%
referenced several times by those
testifying

02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh in favor of the legislation and i
 
02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to take this opportunity to make
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
it clear
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
i am no one's puppet i am
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
here representing the 30 000 roughly
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
people of salem new hampshire that
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
constitutes rockingham district 8.
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
i represent my own views and i vote my
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
own views
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
i have not always made anyone happy i
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
think the chair can attest to
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
my history of not always going along
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
with what i have been asked
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
but that's not why i'm voting itl today
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm voting itl today
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
because we did have a number of recounts
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
after the 2020 election that were a
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative sample i would say of
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
districts across the state of new
 
02:06:22.159 --> 02:06:23.270 align:start position:0%
districts across the state of new
hampshire

02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
and those individual recounts should put
 
02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
faith in our elections
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we do get it right in new hampshire
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%

02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
i am probably not going to put this on
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar because i think
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to get pulled
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
um so with the committee understanding
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
why i'm not asking for that question
 
02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:54.870 align:start position:0%
why i'm not asking for that question
and

02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
the next bill before us today for
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
executive session is hb 14 90
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
14 96
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
do i have a motion
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
on 14 representative barry did you have
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
anything on 1496.
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman i'm sorry i'm
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
moving on from the next one um
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
this 1496 i am asking the committee's
 
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
indulgence on a continuance on the bill
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
um i am working with the um committee
 
02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee just excuse me it's been a
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
long it was up very late last night the
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsors uh i am working on an
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
amendment with the sponsor to try to
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
reach some kind of compromise language i
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
think that there is some appetite for
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
the concept of allowing more access to
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
the voter checklist than currently
 
02:09:46.159 --> 02:09:47.350 align:start position:0%
the voter checklist than currently
exists

02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
exists
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
but it needs some tweaking so i'm asking
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
for a little bit of indulgence in that
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
because i've been really busy this week
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
and haven't had to get the amendment
 
02:09:53.679 --> 02:09:54.629 align:start position:0%
and haven't had to get the amendment
ready

02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
ready
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
all right i am going to indulge that
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
request and if any committee member has
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
a bill that they see an executive
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
session that they're working with the
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor and an amendment and it is not
 
02:10:03.199 --> 02:10:04.470 align:start position:0%
sponsor and an amendment and it is not
done

02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
please feel free to bring that forward
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind and again whip out your
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
calendars i anticipate that our our last
 
02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
executive session on bills
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
before crossover will be the 9th end or
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
that is the week before our deadline i
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we have our votes and
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
reports out in plenty of time but we
 
02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
there will be bills
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
um even though we might be ready to do
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
them they're not going to be scheduled
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
till after town elections so we're going
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
to have that opportunity to vote on
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
anything you might want to continue to
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
work on on one of those days
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
all right so 1496 will be re-noticed for
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
a further
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:59.639 --> 02:11:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
cicr15

02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
cicr15
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
lowers the age to vote in a primary to
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
17 for those who will be 18 in the
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
general election um i want to make this
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
comment for this bill and all of the
 
02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
cacrs you might recall i think it was
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
done in session that i i made a comment
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
that the bills app referred to boxes and
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
check marks when the current practice is
 
02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:21.430 align:start position:0%
check marks when the current practice is
ovals

02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
ovals
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
um i want to thank the sponsors of all
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
these amendments i emailed them they
 
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
contacted ols in regards to changing the
 
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
language the secretary of state's office
 
02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
got involved
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
and i essentially got told why was i
 
02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
making a big deal about this because we
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
passed a cacr two sessions ago and
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
nobody raised an issue and i'm like
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't in front of me
 
02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:42.149 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't in front of me
um

02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
so the secretary of state's office is
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
going to work with ols and there will
 
02:11:50.310 --> 02:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
probably be a change to this these cas
 
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
yards or any cacrs for the language
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
relating to how the ballot is actually
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to look
 
02:11:58.800 --> 02:11:59.910 align:start position:0%
supposed to look
um

02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:01.350 align:start position:0%
um
because

02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
the ols is saying there's a statute that
 
02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
says it can be ore and the secretary of
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
state is saying but the statute is
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
directing a specific
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
box and we're going to get that worked
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
out in enroll bills i will that will not
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
be considered a substantive amendment to
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
02:12:20.709 --> 02:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to clear that up as to
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
the cac
 
02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:23.430 align:start position:0%
the cac
ours

02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
ours
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
um so we have this in front of us and i
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
believe you should also have a proposed
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of you amendment 2 20
 
02:12:33.199 --> 02:12:34.470 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of you amendment 2 20
22

02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
22
 
02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:38.069 align:start position:0%
22
044h

02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
is there a member who wants to make a
 
02:12:39.679 --> 02:12:41.350 align:start position:0%
is there a member who wants to make a
motion

02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh yes madam chairman
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
i would move that we um we move off to
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
to cacr15 is there a second second that
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative barry do you want to
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh yes madam
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
chairman i would like to um the first of
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
which madam chairman was recognized this
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
is a non-german amendment so if we do
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
take up this amendment we will have to
 
02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:09.189 align:start position:0%
take up this amendment we will have to
have

02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
a separate uh hearing on the amendment
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
the under um if the committee will
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
indulge me i'll speak to the underlying
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill first and then the amendment
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill is actually a
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
concept that i'm not diametrically
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
however this body has rejected it
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
several times i believe
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
that the last committee report was
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
actually written by you madam chairman
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
as to why it was an expedient to
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
legislate so when looking at that
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill was basically a
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
non-starter it wasn't going to happen
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have had many many many bills
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
that have attempted to
 
02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know eat around the edges of the
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
domicile resident question
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
um and this would be
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
a constitutional limit that would
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
finally solve the question of who gets
 
02:13:58.550 --> 02:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
to vote in new hampshire
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
so what it does
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
is it clarifies that only new hampshire
 
02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:04.149 align:start position:0%
is it clarifies that only new hampshire
residents

02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
may vote in new hampshire elections
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
i believe that this is a debate that
 
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
this committee should have i believe it
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
should be a hearing that this committee
 
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
should have and i think it's a vote that
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
this committee should have
 
02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
to finally
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
put that question to bed or at least get
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
on the record about it it is my firm
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
belief that only new hampshire residents
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
should be able to vote that does not
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
mean college students cannot vote here
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
that just means residents can vote here
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
i encourage young people to move here
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
become residents and vote here
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
merely showing up on election day and
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
declaring yourself having a granite
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
state of mind and casting a ballot
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
is not a thing in my world
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
so that's why i brought this amendment
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
forward it will be a fun debate we might
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
even have a little bit of it now
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
but i've thoroughly i hope the committee
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
passes it and i firmly look forward to
 
02:14:53.679 --> 02:14:56.149 align:start position:0%
passes it and i firmly look forward to
it

02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion on
 
02:15:00.550 --> 02:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
which has been made which is in regards
 
02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.510 align:start position:0%
which has been made which is in regards
to

02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:15:06.109 --> 02:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
h2 amendment
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
2022-048 representative bergeron
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased to have heard representative
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
berry indicate that this is a
 
02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:17.669 align:start position:0%
berry indicate that this is a
non-germane

02:15:17.669 --> 02:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
non-germane
 
02:15:17.679 --> 02:15:19.990 align:start position:0%
non-germane
amendment

02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
and it is very substantial substantive
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:24.470 align:start position:0%
as well
um

02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
it it eliminates entirely uh
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
the original intent of constitutional
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
amendment 15
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
which was to allow
 
02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:35.189 align:start position:0%
which was to allow
um

02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:37.030 --> 02:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
youth who would be 18 by the general
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
election to participate in the primary
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
if they hadn't quite turned 18
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know which is a couple months
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
earlier the primaries a couple months
 
02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
earlier uh that's eliminated entirely
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
and then it introduces the words uh the
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
person has to be domiciled and have
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
primary residency
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire in order to
 
02:16:02.069 --> 02:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
that is extremely open-ended and
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of examples of military who
 
02:16:10.229 --> 02:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to declare new
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire as their residents if they
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
entered the service
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
at the time they were living in new
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire they will not be domiciled in
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire any longer and it's really
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
no longer their primary residency there
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
are a lot of issues here to to throw
 
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
this into the constitution
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
is a real concern you know we can fight
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
it out on
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
among our rsas and change language there
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
as we do almost every session we have
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
debates over the subject
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
but i have real serious concerns about
 
02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
putting this very restrictive language
 
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
into our state constitution and
 
02:16:44.549 --> 02:16:44.559 align:start position:0%
therefore i will oppose the amendment
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
and if the amendment passes i will
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill too
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
as i campaigned
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
in the fall of 2020 and as i've talked
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
to people since
 
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
this is one of the
 
02:17:04.719 --> 02:17:06.389 align:start position:0%
this is one of the
major

02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
major
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
issues that i find amongst the voters
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
that i talk to and i've asked repeatedly
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
who should vote in new hampshire
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
and for
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
the average citizen
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
who does not
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
really understand or know the difference
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
between domicile or residency or what
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
makes those things up
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
the automatic answer is a new hampshire
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
citizen or a new hampshire resident
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
if i follow that up and ask them what
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
they mean they say somebody who lives in
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire pays taxes in new
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire has their car registered in
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire etc
 
02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:46.629 align:start position:0%
new hampshire etc
and

02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
it is it is
 
02:17:48.399 --> 02:17:49.750 align:start position:0%
it is it is
almost

02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
almost
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
exclusively that answer uh and and and
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
by the way when i'm campaigning
 
02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
particularly in the last weeks before
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
the election i do not follow a party
 
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
list when i campaign i go door to door
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
to door to door and talk to everybody
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
who will come to the door
 
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i find that answer to come back
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
again and again
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
and i think it's just a common sense
 
02:18:14.639 --> 02:18:15.830 align:start position:0%
and i think it's just a common sense
approach

02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
approach
 
02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:18.150 align:start position:0%
approach
that

02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.549 --> 02:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
those who vote in new hampshire should
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
be vested in new hampshire should should
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
sort of own new hampshire
 
02:18:26.399 --> 02:18:27.669 align:start position:0%
sort of own new hampshire
i

02:18:27.669 --> 02:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
i understand the concern that
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron has and we
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
probably would need to
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
have further modification to have this
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
meet that muster but the requirement for
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
this i believe is very strong and i
 
02:18:43.519 --> 02:18:44.309 align:start position:0%
this i believe is very strong and i
think

02:18:44.309 --> 02:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
help voters to be confident that their
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion this is as to an
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative berry is right it would
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
be non-germane and require rescheduling
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead thank you madam
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
chair i would welcome a chance to really
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
debate and also inform ourselves of
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
about all the particulars having to do
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
with this question which might require a
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
different bill on a different occasion
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
so we can learn more about how federal
 
02:19:20.639 --> 02:19:22.230 align:start position:0%
so we can learn more about how federal
law

02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
constrains what states do in defining
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
who can vote in different elections and
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i would welcome that i'm not sure
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
this is i'm going to to pre-announce i
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%
think i will oppose the passage of this
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
because i don't think this is giving us
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
that occasion
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hayward
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
address representative bergeron's point
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
in a simple way
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
to say that the military is covered
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
under this would be covered under this
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
under the federal law
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
known as the soldiers and sales relief
 
02:20:02.399 --> 02:20:03.270 align:start position:0%
known as the soldiers and sales relief
act

02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
i myself
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
maintained a
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
domicile residence
 
02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:11.670 align:start position:0%
domicile residence
for

02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
an extended period of time i could
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
get into great detail which i don't
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
think we need to do today especially if
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
bring this up again but uh it's going to
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
have to come up the uh
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
so i'll reserve
 
02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:27.190 align:start position:0%
so i'll reserve
that

02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
discussion for anyone who might want it
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
until later
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further discussion
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
on the motion which is on the floor
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
which is an amendment
 
02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:38.870 align:start position:0%
which is an amendment
to

02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:41.590 align:start position:0%
to
cacr15

02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
cacr15
 
02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you had your hand up before i
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we will have this debate i
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
i hate to sound like the lawyer but
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
after doing it for 40 years i can't help
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
myself if we're going to do this
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
we need to define domicile and primary
 
02:21:04.319 --> 02:21:05.670 align:start position:0%
we need to define domicile and primary
residency

02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
residency
 
02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
in here so people know what it is
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
because this will just invite the court
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
to go back and we'll be in court again
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's what domicile and residency mean
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to have this debate
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to do this
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
we need to do it so that's clear in here
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
so that we don't end up back in court
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
having the same
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
what it's been 10 15 years now that
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
we've been going back and forth on this
 
02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:28.950 align:start position:0%
we've been going back and forth on this
so

02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
that would be my only
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
if we could come if this committee could
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
come up with a solution
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
as to audits that made everyone happy
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
and a solution that finally resolved the
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
domicile residency definition issue
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
we would have like gold stars are just
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
falling from the sky
 
02:21:57.680 --> 02:21:59.429 align:start position:0%
falling from the sky
[Laughter]

02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
drinks on the chair
 
02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
drinks on the chair
[Laughter]

02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
i i will say that i'm not sure that
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
everyone thought we really did a great
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
job in windham but that's okay well i i
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
i no that's very that's very clear
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
that's why i sort of said that because
 
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
as i recall when we did do windham
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
everybody did thought we did a great job
 
02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:16.790 align:start position:0%
everybody did thought we did a great job
until

02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
they did the audit in windham all right
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
so which is often the case and i
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
understand that so any further
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%

02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%

see what the intent of the voter was
and

02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:47.349 --> 02:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
for that reason i believe this ought to
 
02:24:47.359 --> 02:24:54.710 align:start position:0%
for that reason i believe this ought to
pass

02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:20.479 --> 02:25:21.429 align:start position:0%
 
exactly

02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman and uh
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee for just
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
indulging me as i speak some more um i
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
am a big fan of this constitutional
 
02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
amendment i wanted to thank the sponsor
 
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward um as as
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien noted
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh this constitutional amendment is
 
02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
really fairly simple
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
it just puts into place what our current
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
state statute requires for
 
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
how we administer our elections
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
utilizing paper ballots and puts that
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
into our state's constitution
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
as we know we change state statute
 
02:25:53.359 --> 02:25:54.469 align:start position:0%
as we know we change state statute
frequently

02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
in this body
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of the legislation that we've
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
already voted on today does it any
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
legislation we always vote on we'll
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
change state statute and there is that
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
higher threshold to change the state
 
02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:07.030 align:start position:0%
higher threshold to change the state
constitution

02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
by inserting this constitutional
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment into the constitution in the
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
present moment that we're in
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
we will ensure that the state of new
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire continues using paper ballots
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
until such time that the public
 
02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:21.030 align:start position:0%
until such time that the public
overwhelmingly

02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
decides that they no longer want to use
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
paper ballots as the new constitutional
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
amendment would have to go through the
 
02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:28.150 align:start position:0%
amendment would have to go through the
process

02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
to me i believe that would effectively
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
enshrine paper ballots in the state of
 
02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
for the foreseeable future and i know
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure would ever be undone
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's a system that works as as
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
the former and it is it is so bizarre to
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
say former secretary of state bill
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
gardner uh would famously say you cannot
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
hack a pencil
 
02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
in a time when there are so many
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
questions about other states utilizing
 
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
computer forms to fill out ballots and
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities in other states
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
developing tablet systems
 
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
for balloting
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think it is paramount that we maintain
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
a paper ballot for new hampshire
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
citizens that they fill out
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
with a with a black sharpie and i want a
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
shameless plug for everyone listening uh
 
02:27:15.429 --> 02:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
please fill out the oval completely when
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
you do vote
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
because that really does help in
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
ensuring there's a
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
accurate count at the end of the night
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
and for that reasons i would just
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
recommend everybody vote to pass on this
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment i hope we can
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
get this to the voters this year um and
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly i think we would see the
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
granite state vote in the affirmative so
 
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sweeney anyone
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
else representative bergeron
 
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to to oppose this
 
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
primarily because i don't think it's
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to put this into the
 
02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:51.030 align:start position:0%
necessary to put this into the
constitution

02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
this is something we can do in the
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
statutes and in addition the ballot law
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
commission uh and its
 
02:27:59.429 --> 02:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
current exercise of trying to find a
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
replacement machine for
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
um the accu vote systems which you are
 
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.510 align:start position:0%
um the accu vote systems which you are
aging

02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
aging
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
is requiring that paper ballots be used
 
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
so we have already two layers of
 
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
authority that are requiring paper
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
ballots we can do it in state law and
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission is already
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
i see no reason to to put this into the
 
02:28:21.270 --> 02:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
constitution as well so i'll be opposing
 
02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
it primarily for that reason
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bergeron anyone
 
02:28:25.359 --> 02:28:26.469 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bergeron anyone
else

02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative derozan
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
i'll be uh
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
voting in favor of the motion on the
 
02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:35.110 align:start position:0%
voting in favor of the motion on the
floor

02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
floor
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
and again it comes down to
 
02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
voter integrity and the
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
belief and rebuilding the confidence
 
02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:44.309 align:start position:0%
belief and rebuilding the confidence
uh

02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
for voters here in the state that we're
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we don't waver on the idea
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
of making sure that
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to audit and if we
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
get rid of paper ballots
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
and it's a problem with the machine
 
02:28:58.479 --> 02:28:59.270 align:start position:0%
and it's a problem with the machine
either

02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
intentional or otherwise
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's pretty hard to go back and without
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
a paper trail to ascertain what happens
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
so it's a pretty simple concept and i
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
think by putting doing cacr
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
it codifies it so it's
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion the
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is cacr19
 
02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
ought to pass representative growing
 
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important that we put
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
this in the constitution
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
this will give us stability a long term
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
stability as representative sweeney has
 
02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
stability as representative sweeney has
mentioned

02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
as we look forward we have a clear
 
02:29:46.319 --> 02:29:47.270 align:start position:0%
as we look forward we have a clear
paper

02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
paper
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
trail record
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
of our ballots and of our elections
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
i think our our recount procedure
 
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
that we have is one of the reasons why
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
i believe most people have confidence
 
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
in our machine counting
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
i believe if if it was anything other
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
than being able to go back and audit by
 
02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
that it would it would be or or recount
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
as we're doing now it would be difficult
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
to do that and i i
 
02:30:16.830 --> 02:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
as as
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
technology changes and advances i think
 
02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's very important for us to enshrine
 
02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:22.230 align:start position:0%
it's very important for us to enshrine
this

02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:30:25.270 --> 02:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
in the constitution and if there's a
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
change at some point down the road
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
because of technology
 
02:30:33.270 --> 02:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
our citizens will recognize that and
 
02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to make that change but for
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
now i think it's just a very important
 
02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:40.469 align:start position:0%
now i think it's just a very important
process

02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
i just uh wanted to add another
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
aspect of this
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
and there was a time when
 
02:30:52.309 --> 02:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
paper ballots
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
were not as popular that that the the
 
02:30:57.270 --> 02:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
idea of modernization
 
02:30:57.280 --> 02:30:59.510 align:start position:0%
idea of modernization
required

02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
required
 
02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:00.389 align:start position:0%
required
the

02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
use of electronic ballot counting
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
machines without
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
paper ballots and in other states they
 
02:31:10.950 --> 02:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
employed that and i i was shocked you
 
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
know when i found out
 
02:31:14.309 --> 02:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
that other states did not use paper
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
ballots in the same way and
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
to his credit our former secretary of
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
state always defended the use of paper
 
02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:22.230 align:start position:0%
state always defended the use of paper
ballots

02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
and then other states
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
got on board with that as well and have
 
02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
changed the way they
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
run their elections to
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
always include paper ballots i'm
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
thinking of georgia specifically so
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
for that reason i think that this
 
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
is appropriate to enshrine in our
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
constitution and it will increase voter
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
confidence in our elections
 
02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
and it's not um unnecessary i think it
 
02:31:50.950 --> 02:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
is necessary that's why i will be voting
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
not to pass
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
i recall during the testimony that there
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
was some debate about whether
 
02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
ballot meant the actual thing like this
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
or whether it was these paper receipts
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
or paper trail
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
and i thought somebody was going to look
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
into that but i guess nobody has so it
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
stands as written
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
apparently not i don't i don't actually
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
have that in my notes i know we had a
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
discussion on it but i didn't have any
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
of my notes representative barry to
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
answer representative lane's question i
 
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
i that that was my question that i asked
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
um because we're giving a story about my
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
parents voting who didn't want to vote
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
let me go anyways um
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor's intent was that
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
it would cover this but the to answer
 
02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
your question i i mean it could be
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
ambiguous it was definitely the
 
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
legislative intent so maybe by staying
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
saying this now that that will help that
 
02:32:48.389 --> 02:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
if that ever comes up if this does
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
become a constitutional amendment
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's most certainly the legislative
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
intent because i don't think a receipt
 
02:32:56.790 --> 02:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
is a ballot it's a receipt it's a paper
 
02:32:59.830 --> 02:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
trail it's not a ballot
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comment
 
02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead
 
02:33:05.429 --> 02:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
as a
 
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional conservative
 
02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:09.270 align:start position:0%
constitutional conservative
um

02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should be amending
 
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
constitutions for
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
trifling reasons or even for reasons
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
that prove momentary even when they
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
reflect a very
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
strong passion
 
02:33:23.270 --> 02:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the moment
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should be inviting the
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
public mind to think of constitutions as
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
things that should be
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh changed frequently
 
02:33:32.790 --> 02:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
or in the worst case just thrown out
 
02:33:34.230 --> 02:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
completely we should think of them as
 
02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:35.030 align:start position:0%
completely we should think of them as
really

02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
sacrosanct and venerable
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
and only to be amended
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
for the most
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
most important reasons and nothing in
 
02:33:43.910 --> 02:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
suggested that there's any organization
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
or interest
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's opposed to the legislation that
 
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
requires paper ballots so in the absence
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
of really
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
more urgent reasons
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
for including this in the constitution i
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
i would be wary of of doing this so
 
02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
i would be wary of of doing this so
thank

02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:07.190 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
i think uh at some point in the future
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
it may be way in the future
 
02:34:13.370 --> 02:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
um we will be
 
02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:14.830 align:start position:0%
um we will be
[Music]

02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:16.389 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:34:16.389 --> 02:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
learning to we'll have a system of
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh doing digital voting as and that we
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
will learn to trust that as we are now
 
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
learning to trust digital currency
 
02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:28.790 align:start position:0%
learning to trust digital currency
so

02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see a reason to put this in
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
the constitution i know it could be
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
changed at some point but
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
it would be a lot harder to change it
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
out of the constitution
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
than just changing a law
 
02:34:42.389 --> 02:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative prudhommer
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
brian i recently did some crack research
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
on my phone
 
02:34:51.270 --> 02:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh and by recently i mean in the last
 
02:34:52.710 --> 02:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh and the definition of ballot
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
according to merriam-webster is a sheet
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
of paper used to cast a secret vote
 
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that is the generally
 
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
accepted definition among the public
 
02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:06.230 align:start position:0%
accepted definition among the public
and

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
the reason for
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
why we
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
believe it's important and our um
 
02:35:16.150 --> 02:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
accepted definition as well
 
02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
further comments on the motion on the
 
02:35:19.670 --> 02:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
floor representative barry i'll be very
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
brief i just wanted to give
 
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet a shout out for
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
the cryptocurrency reference that was uh
 
02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
all right we're not talking about
 
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency representative groin
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
just just uh
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
to add to what representative prudhomme
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
o'brien said the the wording in the bill
 
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
is for purposes of facilitating the
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
examination and recounting of votes cast
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
all elections shall be conducted using
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
paper ballots so adding to the
 
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
definition of ballots that she picked up
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh it says they shall be conducted using
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
paper ballots i i do think that's very
 
02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
clear and again i just wanted to add
 
02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:04.389 align:start position:0%
clear and again i just wanted to add
this

02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:04.399 align:start position:0%

very simple piece of legislation um and

i am aware that there are
 
02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:51.990 align:start position:0%

02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
voter
 
02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
registered voters that we do not
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
currently have this data for
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
but for those that we do have the date
 
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
of registration for the date that the
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
secretary of state received their voter
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
registration paperwork
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
they would be able to
 
02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
put that onto the checklist that they do
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
manage and and then you know sell to the
 
02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
political organizations registered in
 
02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire um as just
 
02:39:17.429 --> 02:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
another data point on the checklist so i
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
would recom i would encourage everyone
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass thank you further
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative bergeron yes
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh i'm going to
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
oppose the the motion of ought to pass
 
02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:31.270 align:start position:0%
oppose the the motion of ought to pass
um

02:39:31.270 --> 02:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:32.630 align:start position:0%
um
this

02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
how to track the information concerns me
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
for one thing when a person moves let's
 
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
say from nashua ward 2 to nashua ward 5
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're considered a new voter in in
 
02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
ward 5. they may have actually lived in
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
nashua for 30 years but
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
this creates a situation where it will
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
look like they had just registered to
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
vote maybe two weeks ago
 
02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.550 align:start position:0%
vote maybe two weeks ago
um

02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:53.349 align:start position:0%
um
i

02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
the idea that this is also going to be
 
02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
included on the checklist causes me some
 
02:39:59.030 --> 02:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
concerns there's really no reason for
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
that um if a person is is coming in to
 
02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
obtain a checklist what's important is
 
02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
their their identity and their current
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
residency their domicile address not
 
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
when they registered to vote
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
this is just
 
02:40:11.439 --> 02:40:13.269 align:start position:0%
this is just
unnecessary

02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
personal information being collected and
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
displayed on checklists that i think
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
intrudes upon people's right to privacy
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
and really serves no purses purpose
 
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
whatsoever as to a person's right to get
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
to get a ballot or not on election day
 
02:40:29.429 --> 02:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
so i'll be opposing the motion
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
the bill is hb1009
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
if there's no
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:40:43.269 --> 02:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the clerk to call the
 
02:40:43.279 --> 02:40:45.349 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the clerk to call the

organizations
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not going to create more work on
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
any departments they already have this
 
02:43:27.830 --> 02:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
data statute just does not allow this
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
data to be included in the statewide
 
02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
voter history file
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
and this the bill as originally
 
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
submitted did not have the right section
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
amended in law to allow what we had
 
02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
talked about so the amendment actually
 
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
corrects the right section of law
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the intended purpose of the original
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill so thank you
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
i support the amendment as proposed by
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney and
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
then we'll support the bill as amended i
 
02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
think this this just happens to be an
 
02:44:02.630 --> 02:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
odd little
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
situation of language where i think the
 
02:44:06.309 --> 02:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
intent was always there that municipal
 
02:44:08.309 --> 02:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
voter history would be included in
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
reports it could be provided uh upon
 
02:44:13.429 --> 02:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
those to those who are eligible to
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
receive that information um and this i
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
think just just straightens out the
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
language to make it clear what the
 
02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
intent of the original legislation was
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
so i'll support this
 
02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the motion on

02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh the voting age citizens are limited
 
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
english proficient or if their education
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
levels are at
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
fifth grade levels um
 
02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:11.510 align:start position:0%
fifth grade levels um
if

02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
if we were to do something like this and
 
02:49:15.750 --> 02:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
certainly the bill as it's currently
 
02:49:17.750 --> 02:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
written probably doesn't isn't clear
 
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
enough uh i think it would be
 
02:49:23.190 --> 02:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
important for us to understand how new
 
02:49:25.750 --> 02:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire may eventually have to
 
02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
incorporate some of these federal
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
requirements on
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
language proficiency in terms of voting
 
02:49:35.190 --> 02:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
activity i i think we could learn a lot
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
from an interim study exercise and
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think we would produce
 
02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislation but i think it would prepare
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
us for
 
02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
action on something like this perhaps in
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.510 --> 02:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:52.469 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:49:52.469 --> 02:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you at as chair the
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
situation i created for us as a
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
committee with the number of retained
 
02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
bills last year was
 
02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:01.590 align:start position:0%
bills last year was
um

02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
something i would not knowingly do again
 
02:50:09.590 --> 02:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and so i guess what uh
 
02:50:12.070 --> 02:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
i would have been looking for
 
02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
was some specifics raised
 
02:50:18.150 --> 02:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
in regards to the bill itself rather
 
02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:19.590 align:start position:0%
in regards to the bill itself rather
than

02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
the requirement i'm i'm not
 
02:50:24.790 --> 02:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
sure that i'm really hearing anything
 
02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
other than this is a pretty interesting
 
02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
and complex area of the law
 
02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe we should look at it
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
some more but i'm not hearing
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
what different outcome people white
 
02:50:41.510 --> 02:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
might want which is why we have
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
amendments and i am always happy to
 
02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
entertain amendments
 
02:50:48.550 --> 02:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
so could could
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know i get we get staff to help us
 
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
study an issue
 
02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:53.750 align:start position:0%
study an issue
um

02:50:53.750 --> 02:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:51:00.309 --> 02:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
hold on to bills but i'm not sure
 
02:51:02.469 --> 02:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to end up on this if
 
02:51:03.990 --> 02:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
anybody have any clarification for that
 
02:51:08.309 --> 02:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate your uh you know your
 
02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:12.070 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate your uh you know your
your

02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
reflections on on
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
on retaining bills and as a as a you
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
know beginner uh
 
02:51:20.790 --> 02:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
i have a lot to learn but i i thought
 
02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
there might be some
 
02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
maybe more than some utility to to
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
retaining this uh nonetheless i you know
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
defer to your expertise madam chair
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with expertise that
 
02:51:34.710 --> 02:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
has to do with calendars and votings and
 
02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:35.750 align:start position:0%
has to do with calendars and votings and
um

02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:38.469 --> 02:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
where we're going to end up
 
02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
we did have an amendment in regards to
 
02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
this that was presented
 
02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:45.920 align:start position:0%

02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%

02:51:50.230 --> 02:51:50.240 align:start position:0%

anybody want to speak and recap what the
 
02:52:25.990 --> 02:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor presented in regards to the
 
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
amendment representative bergeron thank
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um
 
02:52:32.070 --> 02:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we had when the
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor initially presented the bill was
 
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
it wasn't really clear how many
 
02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
languages voter materials would need to
 
02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
be made
 
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
available and i think was pointed out
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
that some of our cities have as many as
 
02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
52 to 54 languages spoken in their
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
school systems
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:50.790 align:start position:0%
in addition
there

02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't a clear threshold of what
 
02:52:55.830 --> 02:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of people would be
 
02:52:55.840 --> 02:52:56.950 align:start position:0%
percentage of people would be
primarily

02:52:56.950 --> 02:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
their prime language was other some
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
language other than english so the
 
02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor tried to address that by saying
 
02:53:05.910 --> 02:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
the threshold was three percent and then
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
he included language that says up to
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
three languages uh as opposed to concern
 
02:53:12.389 --> 02:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
some of us might have had for how many
 
02:53:14.389 --> 02:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
languages are actually spoken in our
 
02:53:14.399 --> 02:53:17.110 align:start position:0%
languages are actually spoken in our
communities

02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:18.240 align:start position:0%

i'm sorry was a motion made to act on
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended yet no
 
02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate for me to move
 
02:55:21.429 --> 02:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh that this bill should be ought to
 
02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
pass as amended
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
sure i'll take that motion okay i will
 
02:55:26.950 --> 02:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
so move i'd like to speak on the motion
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
if i might
 
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
a second
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay i slipped up by letting that happen
 
02:55:38.550 --> 02:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
you guys need to be a little bit more on
 
02:55:41.830 --> 02:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair all right
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron to speak to your
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
motion while the bill is amended perhaps
 
02:55:50.070 --> 02:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
lacks the kind of
 
02:55:52.630 --> 02:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
precision and the uh
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
types of measurements that should be
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
used in determining which languages a
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
community might choose to
 
02:56:02.309 --> 02:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
make voter information available in it
 
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
is a step in the right direction and
 
02:56:06.550 --> 02:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
therefore i would support the bill as
 
02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:09.830 align:start position:0%
therefore i would support the bill as
amended

02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney
 
02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you um while i i agree
 
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we have amended the bill um and i
 
02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
supported as the roll call says that
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
move to amend um i will be voting
 
02:56:22.870 --> 02:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
against this motion
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
i just do not feel that this legislation
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
is ready for prime time and i i believe
 
02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
and agree with others that have stated
 
02:56:31.750 --> 02:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
the calendar constraints of the cycle
 
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
really do not pertain us to do too much
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
else with this legislation
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
but i will not be supporting octopass as
 
02:56:39.349 --> 02:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
amended thank you
 
02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
i i'll just say for experience for
 
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative moorhead what
 
02:56:45.429 --> 02:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
the leadership has done in this
 
02:56:47.750 --> 02:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
particular calendar cycle is once again
 
02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
decide it would be very nice to get
 
02:56:51.990 --> 02:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
everything done in may
 
02:56:54.389 --> 02:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
and not be in session in june
 
02:56:56.230 --> 02:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
which sounds wonderful when you're
 
02:56:57.910 --> 02:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
setting the calendar in the first week
 
02:57:00.870 --> 02:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
in january but when you get to april
 
02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's a really horrible idea so i'll just
 
02:57:06.309 --> 02:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
say that from experience representative
 
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:57:12.230 --> 02:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:57:16.389 --> 02:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:19.429 --> 02:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
needs of people who are not
 
02:57:22.230 --> 02:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
fluent in english but when i asked the
 
02:57:25.110 --> 02:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor about this bill he was not able
 
02:57:27.429 --> 02:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
to tell me the amount of people in his
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
community of nashua who
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
were the percentage of people that were
 
02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:33.349 align:start position:0%
were the percentage of people that were
not

02:57:33.349 --> 02:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:57:34.950 --> 02:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:57:37.590 --> 02:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
speak fluently in english so i'm not
 
02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
sure how much of a problem there is
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
and for that reason i i will be voting
 
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass as amended
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative barry yes madam chairman
 
02:57:50.710 --> 02:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
i'll be uh just renouncing our votes
 
02:57:53.349 --> 02:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'll be uh voting against the uh the
 
02:57:55.830 --> 02:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass as amended um
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
the uh i believe the idea of an interim
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
study was was thrown about uh but it
 
02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like that's the path we'll
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
be going forward so i would ask the
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee to vote
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass as admitted
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
motion so that another emotion can be
 
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%

03:01:37.750 --> 03:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:01:40.790 --> 03:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
as i think we all know in here we've
 
03:01:43.510 --> 03:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
heard um testimony i've gotten numerous
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
emails about the concern for voter
 
03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:46.950 align:start position:0%
emails about the concern for voter
integrity

03:01:46.950 --> 03:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
03:01:50.630 --> 03:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's also no secret that
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
many towns are looking at replacing
 
03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:53.990 align:start position:0%
many towns are looking at replacing
their

03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
current vote counting machines as they
 
03:02:00.230 --> 03:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
get to the end of their life
 
03:02:03.190 --> 03:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind with with the idea
 
03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:02:06.469 --> 03:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
connecting these machines to the
 
03:02:06.479 --> 03:02:07.590 align:start position:0%
connecting these machines to the
internet

03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
internet
 
03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
could lend itself to problems
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
of being hacked
 
03:02:16.230 --> 03:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
either intentionally or otherwise
 
03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is a common sense
 
03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill to ensure that we never connect
 
03:02:21.510 --> 03:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
them because i can't think any good
 
03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
reason to to connect these
 
03:02:25.349 --> 03:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
and give anybody temptation to try to
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
see if they can get in and and tamper
 
03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
with them
 
03:02:30.870 --> 03:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
so with with
 
03:02:33.190 --> 03:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
with that being said
 
03:02:34.469 --> 03:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
in the name of
 
03:02:34.479 --> 03:02:36.550 align:start position:0%

03:02:38.469 --> 03:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh confidence
 
03:02:39.830 --> 03:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
in voter
 
03:02:41.990 --> 03:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
in voter integrity in the state of new
 
03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:42.950 align:start position:0%

chair
 
03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'll be supporting the bill as well um
 
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
i was not present for the public hearing
 
03:02:57.670 --> 03:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i reached out to secretary scanlon
 
03:03:00.150 --> 03:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
with a couple of questions that i had
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
one dealt specifically with the
 
03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
accessible voting system i was wondering
 
03:03:05.910 --> 03:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
if that used any kind of wi-fi or
 
03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:07.269 align:start position:0%
if that used any kind of wi-fi or
internet

03:03:07.269 --> 03:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
internet
 
03:03:09.269 --> 03:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
technology he advised me that it's
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
hardwired and does not have wireless
 
03:03:11.279 --> 03:03:12.389 align:start position:0%
hardwired and does not have wireless
capability

03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
capability
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
i also asked him uh if any of the
 
03:03:16.230 --> 03:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
machines being looked at currently to
 
03:03:18.230 --> 03:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
replace the accu volt machine had
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
wireless capability and he said no the
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission has established
 
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
that the devices should not have
 
03:03:27.030 --> 03:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
wireless capabilities so i was satisfied
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
with my questions and and i agree with
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker that this this
 
03:03:31.359 --> 03:03:32.469 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker that this this
really

03:03:32.469 --> 03:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't hurt to put it into the
 
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
statute and say that it shall not have
 
03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
wireless capability
 
03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
