00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to briefly go through the
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
history of this statute because we need
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
to know the background of how it got to
 
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
be the current statute came to be as
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
part of a
 
00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:39.539 align:start position:0%
um to be as a result of sweeping changes
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
of recodification of agricultural
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
statutes back in 1985.
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
it was part of hb25 which was about 300
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
pages long
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
and the first 293 Pages dealt with title
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
XL while the last handful of pages
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
included RSA 12--f the whole thing
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
passed and so this statute was
 
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
recodified and moved to its current
 
00:09:07.329 --> 00:09:07.339 align:start position:0%
place in our law it used to be chapter
 
00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:10.019 align:start position:0%
432 colon 1.
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
prior to the 1985 recodification this
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
weather modification experimentation
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
legislation was first introduced into
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature's house resources
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
Recreation and development committee as
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
far back as 1953 as hb412 it was
 
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
considered in 1953 with regard to
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
project cirrus cloud seeding for rain
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
making in times of drought and that
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
possible experiments would be done at
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington Observatory
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
at the time according to scan hearing
 
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:49.700 align:start position:0%
minutes there were some meteorologist
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
meteorological investigations already
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
going up on Mount Washington by
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
companies like GE
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
and this was viewed as a means to bring
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
corporations to do additional serious
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
experiments and bring possible benefits
 
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire
 
00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:09.899 align:start position:0%
GE documented the experiments they did
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
on Mount Washington as part of their
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
history of project Cirrus and the
 
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
meetings of the New Hampshire Committee
 
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
hearing revealed that the federal
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
government had a similar bill being
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
considered by Congress by the Department
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
of Commerce at the time
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
in this New Hampshire committee there
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
were concerns about what would happen if
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
experiment results drifted into States
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
like Vermont and Maine
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
would our state be held liable
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
but the response was that the statute
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
covered that it doesn't and at the time
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of lawsuit pending
 
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.339 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire New York City Courts
 
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
there were conferences to the cost of
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
these projects and that ground seating
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
would be less expensive than air seeding
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
other comments indicated that
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
departments like fish and game
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire State Council of
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
resources and development saw this as
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
permissive legislation and that fishing
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
game did a study of habitat and ecology
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
and showed that controlling the
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
experiments was possible there was no
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
explanation of how that would be
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
others expressed concern about
 
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
unqualified people running these
 
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
experiments and in the end they all
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
agreed that the bill was acceptable so
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
in 1953 it became law
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
attempted repeal of the current statute
 
00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
was attempted in 2013 in the house
 
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:35.339 align:start position:0%
Science and Technology committee
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
it failed then because they felt no
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
value in removing it from statute
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
I actually attempted repeal and as a
 
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill last year but came to
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
understand that repeal meant the statute
 
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
would remain totally silent on the issue
 
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
at all which was not really a desired
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
consequence so here I am today with an
 
00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
addition to the statute to put in place
 
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:01.019 align:start position:0%
public notification
 
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
for over 60 years this statute has been
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
in place and no one has used it and no
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
one has plans to use it last year I
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
contacted 13 department heads agencies
 
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
and commissions in New Hampshire to see
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
if they ever used the statute or plan to
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
use it
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
Penn replied no and three did not return
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
my email of many reservations regarding
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
the statute as it stands today and while
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
it hasn't seemed to be a bother being in
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
place for all this time its potential is
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
disturbing without some sort of public
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
notification included there's no mention
 
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
of having proposals of weather
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
modification experimentation coming to a
 
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
vote or approval from New Hampshire
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
citizens there's no mention or
 
00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459 align:start position:0%
limitation of what types of experiments
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
could be performed experimentation could
 
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
result in some pretty devastating health
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
and ecological Fallout
 
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee of safety to our
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
state ecology or population there's no
 
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
mention of the liability our state would
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
have when neighboring states and what
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
problems this could cause our
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
agricultural Community most people in
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have no idea that the
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
statute even exists and this is why I'd
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
like to at least add a public
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
notification element so that if plans do
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
come about then the citizens of the
 
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.019 align:start position:0%
state can at least be informed about
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
them ahead of time and have an
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
there are many articles and websites
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
which discuss the ability of man to
 
00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
control weather
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
especially in these times when we are
 
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.700 align:start position:0%
concerned about changes in our climate
 
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
and weather patterns I'm no scientist
 
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
but in reading up on the subject more
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
and more scientists agree that
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
controlling the weather is nearly
 
00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:46.019 align:start position:0%
impossible because of the huge list of
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
variables involved however for a long
 
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
time there's been experimentation going
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
on in small and large scale with some of
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
that the public is aware of and some not
 
00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
the truth is that despite experiments
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
and studies over the decades it is still
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
challenging to carry out such controlled
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
experiments and difficult to ascertain
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
if they will actually work
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
the jury is still out on whether or not
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
these experiments are favorable to the
 
00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:14.090 align:start position:0%
these experiments are favorable to the
planet

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
planet
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
or can create undesirable effects in the
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
long term
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
no one is really sure what releasing
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
various chemicals into the air will do
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
to everything below or if there are
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
so the statute that we currently have is
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
so Broad and gives carte blanche to the
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
state on this issue of weather
 
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
experimentation I'm not convinced that
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
allowing departments and agencies in our
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
state to have unfettered ability to do
 
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
weather modification experiments in the
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
Skies over New Hampshire is a good or
 
00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:46.019 align:start position:0%
safe thing
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
but we should at the very least insert
 
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
public input into the process
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
and so I hope that you will
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
consider this bill and and give it an
 
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
OTP and I am happy to take any of your
 
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.490 align:start position:0%
OTP and I am happy to take any of your
questions

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
to representative shewitt
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Aaron for
 
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned possible effects on
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
particular neighboring states do you
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
know if any other states have such a law
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
and particularly if they have this
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%

States out west I I'd have to dig
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
through some of my notes to see
 
00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:39.410 align:start position:0%
through some of my notes to see
um

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.420 align:start position:0%

her name was Amy Vickers uh last year
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
and she indicated that there were some
 
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:52.019 align:start position:0%
other states that did have uh some
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
statute which
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh discussed the um you know
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
climate experimentation weather
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
experimentation and some of the um
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh you know safeguards that they had in
 
00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.990 align:start position:0%

appreciate that um
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
I have spoken uh emailed several uh like
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
I said uh uh 10 uh 13 uh department
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
heads and that was uh let's see I spoke
 
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.910 align:start position:0%
heads and that was uh let's see I spoke
with

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:55.259 align:start position:0%
um the department of safety uh
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Fish and Game uh division
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
of force and lands uh information
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
technology department of Agriculture uh
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
unh's agriculture experimentation
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
station and a few others and they all
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
indicated to me that they have never
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
their agency never used the statute they
 
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
don't have any plans of any
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
weather experimentation or modification
 
00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
and they actually had no use for the
 
00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
statute at all so when I first inquired
 
00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:28.130 align:start position:0%
statute at all so when I first inquired
about

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
repealing the statute they were all okay
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
with it because they said we never used
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
this in the 60 years we've had this on
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
the books and we don't see anything
 
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.210 align:start position:0%
the books and we don't see anything
coming

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
um but I do know that that there has
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
been some talk
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
about weather experimentation
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh from the federal government and of
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
course New Hampshire would have to work
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with any of the federal
 
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.890 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with any of the federal
government

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh programs but to date there hasn't
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
been any uh anything done that I'm aware
 
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.669 align:start position:0%
been any uh anything done that I'm aware
of

00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
um or that these uh department heads are
 
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't that doesn't mean that
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
um representative Aaron
 
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:24.890 align:start position:0%
um representative Aaron
um

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there had has been
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
sometime in the past experimentation
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
that people don't even know about so I'm
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
um some of that has been or in the
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
future could be done by companies or
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
individuals and is there anything in our
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
statutes that deals with that because
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
this seems to do to deal with state
 
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.789 align:start position:0%
this seems to do to deal with state
agencies

00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know I mean
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
the original reason why this statute was
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
put in place was you know they were they
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
were talking about uh you know when when
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had any kind of drought
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
conditions in the winter that they might
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
need to see the clouds to do uh you know
 
00:19:17.529 --> 00:19:17.539 align:start position:0%
bring snow
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
and of course nowadays we have snow
 
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
making machines at our at our ski areas
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
so we don't really need to do anything
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
to kind of fiddle around with weather
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
but that was kind of the impetus in the
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
1950s when this all came about was you
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
know to help the state if we ever had
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
any kind of drought conditions
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know really of any companies
 
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
that have done anything on a smaller
 
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
scale and that's the thing is we just
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know if there's
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
anything through the Department of
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection or I mean
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services through Des
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
or Health and Human Services where any
 
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.669 align:start position:0%
or Health and Human Services where any
particular

00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:08.270 align:start position:0%
particular
um

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know any particular uh companies
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
have done anything on their own
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that they need any kind
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:28.990 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:34.210 align:start position:0%

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I can't
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
um understand I can you're loud enough
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
but it's very garbled I can't understand
 
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:44.900 align:start position:0%
the words
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
I was just clarifying I feel like uh
 
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative fellows was asking you if
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
your bill does anything to um notify the
 
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.470 align:start position:0%
your bill does anything to um notify the
public

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
anybody representative Erin did you hear
 
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
anybody representative Erin did you hear
that

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
can everyone hear me I'm sorry sorry
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
I was trying to ask you and for my own
 
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.890 align:start position:0%
I was trying to ask you and for my own
clarification

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
does your bill do anything to notify the
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
public of a private company were to
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
decide to do anything whatsoever
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
no um perhaps that's something that the
 
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.390 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this is more of a
 
00:21:48.409 --> 00:21:48.419 align:start position:0%
question of the chair
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
um the last time this bill went forward
 
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:51.409 align:start position:0%
um the last time this bill went forward
to

00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:51.419 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419 align:start position:0%
in 2013 to repeal this went to Science
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
and Tech and this seems like it's more
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
of their purview than ours can we get
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
some input from them before we vote on
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
this as to how they feel about this
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good idea
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire before we call an
 
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.430 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire before we call an
executive

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.010 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
the the other thing here
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
just just think about what you said
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
um you know this isn't Edna is not being
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
asked to modify any of the technical
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
aspects of this I think this bill from
 
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
what I can really tell just really only
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
is asking for uh public notification
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the gist of what this
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
okay representative of a Bryant
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron thank you for
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh can you just
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
explain why you went this route uh
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
basically in my reading of the bill it
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
is to have them notify uh make sure that
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
the public is notified that they're
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
doing any of these experimentations but
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
why didn't you go for perhaps maybe
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
trying to get a permit which would have
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
gave to the state more authority to look
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
at it instead of just a notification the
 
00:23:21.659 --> 00:23:23.630 align:start position:0%
at it instead of just a notification the
notification

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
will probably just say I'm gonna go do
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
it but applying for the permit could be
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
denied if it was so contrary in that
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
vein if you choose to answer that
 
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
question please
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh representative O'Brien
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that well you know I looked
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
at the statute to begin with and and
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
really the way the statute reads is that
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
any department or agency of the state
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
may with the approval of the governor
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
and Council and within the limits of
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated funds or by means of gift
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
donations or grants engaged and and
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
undertake experimentation in the
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
techniques and methods for weather
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
modification and may cooperate therein
 
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
with the federal government with
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
authorized agencies of other states and
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
with interested persons and
 
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.350 align:start position:0%
with interested persons and
organizations

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
this statute doesn't talk anything about
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
applying for permits I don't even know
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
if we have a permitting process through
 
00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.730 align:start position:0%
if we have a permitting process through
Des

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
or Department of Health and Human
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
Services or any of that
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they do I think this the
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
way the statute is written is just that
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
the agency heads would come out would
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
have some kind of weather modification
 
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
program or plan and take it to the
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
executive Council and the governor and
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
you know I since there's no permitting
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
process that I see in place at all
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh there was nothing there to
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
amend and I didn't think I had any kind
 
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.490 align:start position:0%
amend and I didn't think I had any kind
of

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:02.500 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:02.750 align:start position:0%
of
[Music]

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.510 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge enough about you know creating
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
a permitting process
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
but the least the very least that I
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was to have public input
 
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:18.260 align:start position:0%
into the process that exists
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer thank you Mr
 
00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:29.029 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer thank you Mr
chairman

00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh well first of
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
all I'd like to Second representative
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
goalie's suggestion that we uh contact
 
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
the talk with uh st e uh with regard to
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
their previous actions on this bill but
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
uh representative Aaron's information uh
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
that uh governor and Council have to uh
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
get involved and and uh and approve this
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
to me that that's all the control that
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
we need I don't think of the
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
notification concept is a bad idea uh
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
because I think the public certainly
 
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
should be aware of if the state is
 
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:08.900 align:start position:0%
setting about
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
tinkering with our weather uh it's
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
already enough of a problem just with
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
the natural course of things but uh if
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
the governor or Council have to approve
 
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
before anything goes forward on behalf
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
um then that's as much control as as we
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
probably need that is public input
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
through the executive counselors and uh
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
the governor of course but
 
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.049 align:start position:0%
the governor of course but
um

00:26:35.049 --> 00:26:35.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
I think we're good to go with
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair appreciate that any
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
 
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.750 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
Aaron

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
Aaron
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
see none does he representative Aaron
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony is anyone
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can I just interject briefly
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
um I think you need to to pull back a
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
little bit from the mic you're leaning
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
into it just a bit too much and that's
 
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
causing a little bit of um Distortion
 
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
thanks trying to find that sweet spot
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
um exactly
 
00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:16.700 align:start position:0%
the chair of us recognizes
 
00:27:20.409 --> 00:27:20.419 align:start position:0%
representative Silva
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative would you uh like to
 
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
you'll have to unmute yourself there we
 
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
go I think I've got it now right yeah
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
good morning uh I'm representative Mike
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
Sylvia from Belknap uh six town of
 
00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
Belmont and I just want to do uh briefly
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
jump in and uh in support of the bill
 
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
I think this is uh important for uh
 
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.470 align:start position:0%
I think this is uh important for uh
transparency

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:10.100 align:start position:0%
uh and our constitution Aristotle
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
demands that we uh we provide
 
00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:18.059 align:start position:0%
transparency to our citizens and uh most
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
of us wouldn't have even known about
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill and the Bill of the
 
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
policy of weather modification and
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
certainly uh if something like that is
 
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
going to be put forward
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
we certainly want to have enough uh
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
notice of it that we can really look
 
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
into it as best we can
 
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:53.470 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.330 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay uh the chair record is representing
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone thank you for the
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
opportunity and um I've been on a lot of
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
webinars I have to admit this is the
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
first time I've been on Zoom so
 
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:15.299 align:start position:0%
apologies if there's any issues here
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
um just want to thank all of you and
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
particularly um representative Aaron I
 
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
just learned about the bill being
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
introduced again
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
um as I said last year when I spoke
 
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.010 align:start position:0%
um as I said last year when I spoke
briefly

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm an engineer I'm based in Amherst
 
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.330 align:start position:0%
um I'm an engineer I'm based in Amherst
Massachusetts

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:28.340 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
I work as a consultant to large and
 
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
small water utilities in the U.S and
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
overseas on water efficiency issues and
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
I have become educated in recent years
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
about the extent of wild seating that
 
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
goes on particularly among water
 
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
utilities so briefly I'm strongly in
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I think if you pass
 
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
it New Hampshire will really be a
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
Pioneer in the area of public
 
00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
notification about weather modification
 
00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:00.059 align:start position:0%
it's an increasing practice there's some
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
controversy about it I think no matter
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
which side of the debate you're on I
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
think we can all agree that the public
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
has a right to know this is going on
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
um and I think there's a lot of
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence to indicate that
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
weather modification activities in one
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
area can affect whether in another area
 
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
right now in New England to my knowledge
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
at least there's not a lot if any
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
weather modification going on but I
 
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
think as the years go on we may see that
 
00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
change the technology of whether
 
00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
modification is advancing quickly and I
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
think water suppliers here may start to
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
look at that as an option as well and
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
again that has an impact not just on the
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
immediate water supply so briefly those
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
are my comments and again I strongly
 
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support this bill and
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
it would be a real boost to um public
 
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
information thank you
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh will you take questions Mr
 
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.630 align:start position:0%
thank you uh will you take questions Mr
Speaker

00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker because we take questions oh
 
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:04.340 align:start position:0%
yes I will pardon me yes
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
thing going on and can you tell us where
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
that has happened is you know
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
um if you do an internet search you put
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
in cloud seating I think at least in the
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
United States you'll see it's mostly
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
west of the Mississippi but but if you
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
drill down and look at some of the
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
different weather modification or cloud
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
seeding companies most of them are based
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
in the west but you'll see examples of
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
weather modification activities in the
 
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
East for example the last time I looked
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
at one company there were weather
 
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
modification activities going on in
 
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.810 align:start position:0%
modification activities going on in
Delaware

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
Delaware
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
um you know again if you get an update
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you'd see different information
 
00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:54.419 align:start position:0%
but Cloud sitting is used for many many
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
things today water supply agriculture
 
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:01.580 align:start position:0%
hail suppression military
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
so again I can't speak to New England
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
right now I know historically there were
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
experiments here
 
00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:09.539 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't have the latest
 
00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:12.590 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't have the latest
information

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
any further questions Mrs Vickers
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
you've seen none is there anything else
 
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
being none to go ahead and post a public
 
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.510 align:start position:0%
being none to go ahead and post a public
hearing

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
point of order I also I would like to um
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
discuss this with Des before we accept
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
the bill so I'll do that this week but I
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
just wanna I have some environment and
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
some Environmental Conservation
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
questions to ask of them
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
and the chair would be happy if you
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
shared your information with us thank
 
00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:55.970 align:start position:0%
shared your information with us thank
you

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:55.980 align:start position:0%

00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340 align:start position:0%

Madam chair I couldn't understand half
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
of what you were saying sorry I was that
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
I will confer with the chair of science
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
technology and energy and confirm that
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
they have no interest in the current
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
status because there's no technical
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
issues and we will not execute today
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.330 align:start position:0%

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
the this bill being out of date is even
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
before the hearing uh I was asked to
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
look at the executive orders affecting
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
licensing and see which of them belonged
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
in statute So after talking with oplc
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
and some other people
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
we decided that the executive order
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
that permitted military personnel EMTs
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
to apply for licensures and nursing
 
00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:11.579 align:start position:0%
assistant was a
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
was something that ought to be in
 
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.210 align:start position:0%
was something that ought to be in
statute

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh an LNA is the lowest level of
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
licensed medical personnel
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
they have a rather limited scope of
 
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.190 align:start position:0%
they have a rather limited scope of
practice

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
EMTs and paramedics in particular are
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
more than qualified to do what an LMT
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
does but in New Hampshire their
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
licensing is restricted to being with an
 
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
organization a fire department an
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
ambulance a hospital they don't work
 
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.310 align:start position:0%
ambulance a hospital they don't work
independently

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
independently
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it declares
 
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
their education
 
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
equivalent and allows them to apply for
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
a license will let which will let them
 
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
work in other situations using the same
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
skills and experience they have before
 
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
I know that built that such military
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
personnel have worked with covet testing
 
00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:09.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:12.260 align:start position:0%
and if you have questions I believe
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson is a lot more
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
qualified than I am to answer that
 
00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:20.420 align:start position:0%
but basically this the amendment says
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledges their training and
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
expertise and says if they want a
 
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.430 align:start position:0%
expertise and says if they want a
license

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
we'll give them one and they can use it
 
00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
to do things that an EMS license will
 
00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:33.170 align:start position:0%
to do things that an EMS license will
doesn't

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.940 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:49.950 align:start position:0%

00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.569 --> 00:37:56.579 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I don't know who to direct
 
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
the question to perhaps uh
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson uh but from my
 
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
experience and I'm sure it's very
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
similar in other communities perhaps
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
even yours uh some of the firefighters I
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
use already using their EMT EMT Advanced
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
Training and working in the hospital and
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that nothing
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
with this amendment would jeopardize
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
them in that type of occupation of uh
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
working to advance their Medical Careers
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
no it shouldn't all this all this does
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
is it allows them to have the an LMT
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
license in addition to their EMS license
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
with its full scope of practice
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair representative
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
McGuire I just want to make sure that
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
it allows them to apply for licensure
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
but it they must meet the current
 
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.770 align:start position:0%
but it they must meet the current
requirements

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
of that position correct
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
yes if this says that they can use their
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
training and experience instead of the
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
LNA training and experience but they
 
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.050 align:start position:0%
LNA training and experience but they
must

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
must
 
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.010 align:start position:0%
must
um

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
not have committed various crimes and
 
00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:30.770 align:start position:0%
not have committed various crimes and
whatever

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.050 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
they have to pay the fee
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
anyone wish else wish to testify on this
 
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:53.150 align:start position:0%

good morning can you all hear me yes
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
great good morning um acting chairman
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
Roy and members of the committee for the
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
record I'm Tom Broderick legal counsel
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
for the oplc or the office of
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
um the oplc provides administrative and
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
clerical support record keeping keeping
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
services and business processing for the
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
54 occupational licensing boards
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
commissions and councils under its
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
umbrella I'm here on behalf of the oplc
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
2021-0276h I want to be clear first
 
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
while the amendment primarily affects
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing which is under
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
oplc's umbrella I'm speaking now on
 
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
behalf of oplc only uh not on behalf of
 
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing or any of the other
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
boards so as represent representative
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
McGuire had stated this amendment would
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
codify emergency order number 78 which
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
provides an alternative rights route to
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
licensure as a licensed nursing
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
assistant or LNA to those with either
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
certain military experience or
 
00:41:10.089 --> 00:41:10.099 align:start position:0%
individuals a certain EMT or paramedical
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
paramedic licenses and experience
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
my understanding the is that the
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
emergency order was issued in response
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
to an LNA shortage in New Hampshire that
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
shortage has been particularly
 
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
concerning due to the pandemic but again
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that New Hampshire
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
has faced a shortage of lnas even in
 
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
non-pandemic times so this amendment is
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
meant to help alleviate that issue not
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
just during the pandemic But continuing
 
00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:35.780 align:start position:0%
past that
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
oplc's been in contact with Justin
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
romanello the bureau chief at the
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
department of safety's division of fire
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
standards and training in Emergency
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
Medical Services he's indicated that his
 
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
division supports this amendment as well
 
00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:49.609 align:start position:0%
division supports this amendment as well
um

00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
so lastly oplc has been issuing LNA
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
licensees to licenses to those with
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
these credentials since the emergency
 
00:41:58.810 --> 00:41:58.820 align:start position:0%
order came into effect in late December
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
I was anticipating that the committee
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
may have questions about the number of
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
licenses we've issued under this
 
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
emergency order I've reached out to our
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
licensing team to find out how many have
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
been issued but I haven't heard back yet
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
so if you're curious I can get that
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
information to you I really don't have
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
any more points to make but I'm happy to
 
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:25.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
follows

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
um yes I just thank you Mr chair I just
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I would like to know
 
00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.099 align:start position:0%
how many so if he can email us that
 
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
would be great sure
 
00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
representative shewitt
 
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
um my question is probably of the chair
 
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that uh the list that Ms
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
smarling sent out showed eight people
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
had signed in and support and two in
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
opposition and I'm curious if there's
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
any way to tell if those sign-ins were
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
actually directed towards the original
 
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
bill or towards the non-germaine
 
00:43:10.859 --> 00:43:17.230 align:start position:0%
bill or towards the non-germaine
amendment

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
both were noticed so
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I I suppose there's really no way to
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
tell but both were noticed
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I I did see the notice for the
 
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
amendment like I said I was just the
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
Curious the non-germaine amendment was
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
separately posted from the bill so that
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
if somebody signed in
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
on the basic bill that's I would presume
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
that's what they intended to do
 
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you that's something we may want
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
to look at for future to to make it
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
clear if someone has an opinion on
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
particularly a non-germaine Amendment
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to know thank you
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
um representative Schmidt
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so and Mr
 
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:11.060 align:start position:0%
Broderick if you're still on on the line
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
uh I I also would be interested in the
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
statistical information you referenced
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
earlier uh I I know that one of our
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
former Dover firefighters uh was
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
regularly employed at uh or on duty at
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
me I could say it for sure uh at the
 
00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:32.660 align:start position:0%
when was Douglas Hospital emergency room
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
not just on an emergency basis but it
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
was there over a period of months uh
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
quite regularly uh so to the degree that
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
we have a shortage
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
um yeah this this is something I would
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
definitely be interested in more
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
information on so that we can know uh
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
how best to proceed because I say I
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
think these people are eminently
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
qualified and we should support this
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh the chair
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
would like to ask a question the
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
licenses that have been issued
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
um for what length are they are they
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
good for are they issued for the
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
standard amount of time a license would
 
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
be or is there a shorter time period
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
based on the pandemic in the emergency
 
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.770 align:start position:0%
based on the pandemic in the emergency
order

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.089 align:start position:0%
order
so

00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:17.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I don't have the
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
emergency order pulled up but the uh the
 
00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:23.900 align:start position:0%
my memory is that they are valid for
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps three or four months past the
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh past the end of the state of
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
Governors declared state of emergency
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
I'd have to double check that but it's
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
of limited duration because these
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
license are coming from an emergency
 
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.710 align:start position:0%
license are coming from an emergency
order

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
I think that was that's all I wanted to
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
know thank you very much
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
is she none is anyone else for some
 
00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:51.410 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:53.710 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill
[Music]

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
they're being also none I'm going to
 
00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099 align:start position:0%
close public hearing on this bill
 
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
and the next bill will not be till one
 
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.870 align:start position:0%
and the next bill will not be till one
o'clock

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
now one o'clock
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
so the committee will be in recess until
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
1pm hold on oh the wheelchair would like
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
to say something
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
a couple of things first of all we are
 
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:21.140 align:start position:0%
in session on Wednesday and Thursday
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
it will be approximately nine to five on
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and nine to two on Thursday
 
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
because I have another customer after we
 
00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:32.180 align:start position:0%
get out on Thursday
 
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:35.220 align:start position:0%
I have the consultation with
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
representative goalie signed up the
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
authors of all of the blurbs to defend
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
the committee position and he and I are
 
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
splitting the pis if they're if they're
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
if any of the bills come off consent or
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
have debate
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
the only debate that I am sure of is on
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 274 which all of you are well
 
00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.819 --> 00:47:01.849 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make sure that was the case
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
and what else I've got calendars for the
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
people in that are here in case they
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
is there any questions
 
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.290 align:start position:0%
is there any questions
um

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
I guess I did The Minority Report on the
 
00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:23.329 align:start position:0%
I guess I did The Minority Report on the
motion

00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
okay as a member of The Minority Report
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
I was the author of The Minority Report
 
00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
you are essentially leading the
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to the committee position so
 
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
that if you choose to speak or to get
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
someone else to speak
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's your responsibility
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
I've signed up the representative
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
fellows to defend the committee position
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
and representative bowley will do the pi
 
00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:56.210 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:57.650 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
do you need to do business with you now
 
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
I think that if there it would be a good
 
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
idea to use this uh hour and a half or
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
so to consider if there are any about
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
the bills we would like to object that
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
we've heard in previous immunities
 
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
or like a feeler is there any interest
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
in exactly what we just literally talked
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
about with 567.
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
no I'm not interested in that thank you
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
oh 567 I'm so sorry
 
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:41.030 align:start position:0%
oh 567 I'm so sorry
Steve

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
on what the number of licenses that he
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
gave no that's from oplc uh if that's
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
the one you want to talk about yes I'm
 
00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
happy with that yeah okay
 
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:53.780 align:start position:0%
567. literally with that
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
in that case if you have a motion
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment 027
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
. that's representative Schultz took
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:17.579 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion sure uh
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
just just for those in representative
 
00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
goli and certainly representative
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
O'Brien and even representative lindsar
 
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.069 align:start position:0%
O'Brien and even representative lindsar
can

00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
touch on this as well when it you know
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
the the scope of practice that they're
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
talking about here as far as equivalency
 
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.730 align:start position:0%
talking about here as far as equivalency
goes

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
um even EMT basics in the state of New
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
more field
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
standing order Authority than an LNA
 
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
does so so this is really not a matter
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
of worrying about qualifications that's
 
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's certainly um
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
certainly well covered this is just a a
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
matter of an extreme need that is
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
occurring right now and the ability to
 
00:49:58.930 --> 00:49:58.940 align:start position:0%
have folks that are
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
more than qualified and experienced to
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
to fill that need as uh
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
as we move forward through the pandemic
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
and even even beyond that so
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
I think this is a no-brainer it's
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
it's very very uh straightforward and I
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
would encourage all to uh to support
 
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.750 align:start position:0%
would encourage all to uh to support
this

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
Schultz would you like to speak to your
 
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.290 align:start position:0%
Schultz would you like to speak to your
second

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
I explained it very well the need is
 
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
high and this is a good thing
 
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
um and I think the need is going to
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
continue I mean as the uh
 
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
as the you know population agents
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
there's probably going to be more need
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
than we have now so I think it's a good
 
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.730 align:start position:0%
than we have now so I think it's a good
idea

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
is that first on Bailey do you have a
 
00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:48.890 align:start position:0%
is that first on Bailey do you have a
question

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.930 align:start position:0%
question
nope

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
nope
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.099 align:start position:0%
okay uh on seeing anyone
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
in that case the motion is ought to pass
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
Amendment zero two seven six H by
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%

HP 452 ought to pass
 
01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:06.589 align:start position:0%
HP 452 ought to pass
[Music]

01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
uh that's uh precluding the Secretary of
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
State for running for another office
 
01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.579 --> 01:03:20.230 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
are there any would you like to speak to
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.049 --> 01:03:41.059 align:start position:0%
just briefly I think it's a good idea to
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
have the person in charge of making sure
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
the elections are are run correctly from
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
being uh part of the election that needs
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your second
 
01:03:59.049 --> 01:03:59.059 align:start position:0%
yeah it seems like a good bill
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
eliminates conflict of interest
 
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
any uh other comments questions another
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
Allegro you have a couple questions no
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
um even though the situation in New
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is somewhat different than
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
most of the states where secretaries of
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
state are elected directly and ours is
 
01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:29.780 align:start position:0%
elected indirectly as we know
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the idea of the person
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
who's conducting the election and who
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
has Authority with regard to
 
01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
people who are registered to vote or
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
purging the voter rolls and so forth
 
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
there's a clear conflict of interest
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen it in several instances in
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
and even though we don't think that
 
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
represent that Secretary of State Bill
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
Gardner is going to be running for
 
01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
anything else anytime soon
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I I think this is a strong statement
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
in favor of uh transparency and and
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
integrity of the process so I'm going to
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else who
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to mention the timing is
 
01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
right because as representative Schmidt
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
says Secretary of State Gardener is not
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
likely to run for for elected office
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
again and any new secretary of state
 
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:38.900 align:start position:0%
would know this going into the position
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative I'm out of step on this
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against the motion
 
01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
because I've this basically says the
 
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
public is going to be Bamboozled by
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
seeing his signature and golly we have
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
to vote for him I don't subscribe to it
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
at all and I I just don't want to
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
subscribe to that uh I hope that effect
 
01:06:02.049 --> 01:06:02.059 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist uh I don't want to see
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
anybody precluded from running for
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
another office by virtue holding one
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
office so I'll be out of step on this
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
um at least
 
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
from what I've been thinking that that's
 
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's not the issue of people being bad
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
bull Super Bowl it's just the uh
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully only appearance and and who
 
01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:24.059 align:start position:0%
knows uh possibly real conflict of
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
interest where you've got
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
someone who is running for an office
 
01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.109 align:start position:0%
someone who is running for an office
um

01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
you know but also have some trouble with
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on so that's not a good
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
idea in general even if the person is a
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
perfect Integrity it just doesn't look
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
good representative I might point out
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State runs for the
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
um but he's you know his electorate is
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature and it's it's a little
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
different than a general election
 
01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
the bill also lists specifically the uh
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
positions that the
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State could not run for
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
it does not include secretaries
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
I'm citing that only for the Integrity
 
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:22.700 align:start position:0%
issue all that business
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
secretary of state doesn't run the
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
secretary of state election
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
any other comments appearance if I may
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I was hoping that we might
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
retain the bill because I think the bill
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
is um is important but I'm not so sure
 
01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.010 align:start position:0%
is um is important but I'm not so sure
that

01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
we've had enough of a discussion of it
 
01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:53.579 align:start position:0%
and have been enough
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know a little bit I'd like
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
to think more about this bill
 
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
because I do think that the bill has
 
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.970 align:start position:0%
because I do think that the bill has
Merit

01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
Merit
 
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
but I think that before we make
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
such an important decision like this
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.349 align:start position:0%
we do
um

01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'd like to feel more secure about our
 
01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.569 align:start position:0%
I'd like to feel more secure about our
vote

01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
does that make sense I mean I I don't
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
see anything wrong with the bill right
 
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
now but at the same time I'm not
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
convinced that this is it encompasses
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
everything that we wanted to
 
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you and yeah
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'd like to piggyback on
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
what representative scitec said I also
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
have a problem with this bill because
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
running for office uh is something that
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be banned just because of
 
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
holding the Secretary of State's
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
position that's apparent not quite a
 
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
paraphrase in what representative scitec
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
said but I also think it just sends a
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
bad message to say that
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
we suspect a secretary of state would be
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
unable to be impartial and do their job
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
properly if they were running for
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
another office that implies they're
 
01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
doing their job improperly that's a
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
whole there's already a set of laws that
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
pertain to that and while I'm very aware
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
of what's happened in other states
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
um the the Integrity of our elections in
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are I believe are
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
unimpeachable so I don't see
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
why we have this is a bill in search of
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
a problem that doesn't exist in the
 
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
granite state in my opinion
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
if I could I just I think it's more
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
along the lines I don't think it's
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
because we are we feel like there is
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
something going on or has gone on I
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
think it's more along the lines of um if
 
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
you think about judicial
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
um a judge has an obligation to recuse
 
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
himself when there's a obvious conflict
 
01:09:59.810 --> 01:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
or an appearance of a conflict that the
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
public can can take from it
 
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
um the Secretary of State cannot recuse
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
himself and as such if he decides to run
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
for governor or or executive counselor
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
while he's the Secretary of State it's
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
certainly at least can call into
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
question the appearance of any propriety
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
when he's in charge of the very election
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
that he's running for so I don't think
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily that that we've we
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
think he or she or whoever the future
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
one is is going to do something wrong
 
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's about the giving confidence to the
 
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
public that the office is beyond our
 
01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.130 align:start position:0%
public that the office is beyond our
approach

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
I just heard representative Roy say that
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State could not recuse
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
himself but that I think that's part of
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
the argument that I'm hearing from
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative scitec and representative
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
Schultz perhaps we should talk about
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
this bill further
 
01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
and put that option in place if it's an
 
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
office that the secretary is running for
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
that he would have the ability to excuse
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
himself from participating in that
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
particular election decision so I think
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
maybe retaining would be a good
 
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.610 align:start position:0%
maybe retaining would be a good
um

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
a good method to at least examine that
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
possibility thank you
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I too agree it
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
and I think this needs to be looked at a
 
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
little further
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
um I understand uh
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
while he's running for an office he
 
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
should not be uh overseeing the election
 
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
I also look at nor shall a person
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
serving as Secretary of State be
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
eligible for nomination for such an
 
01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.689 align:start position:0%
eligible for nomination for such an
office

01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
um so if there becomes a vacancy or
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
something of that nature and he wants to
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
be he is nominated to go into that
 
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
be he is nominated to go into that
position

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
um this precludes him from doing that
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it hasn't been
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
said yet but it should be perfectly
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
obvious that uh if uh Secretary of State
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh which is not of course we've had the
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
same Secretary of State for like 40
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
years uh so we're in a unique situations
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
Nationwide there's no other Secretary of
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
State who has served anywhere near as
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
long as Bill Gardner has but clearly uh
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State if he really
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
wants another office he could always
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
resign but as long as the secretary of
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
state is the Secretary of State I don't
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
think that he or she should be running
 
01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
for another office is too much of a
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
conflict events we we've seen it in
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
other states where uh all kinds of
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
shenanigans go on
 
01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
so I'm sticking with the idea that this
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
bill is a good idea to make sure that we
 
01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
have integrity of the person who's
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
running for the Secretary of State who
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
is the secretary of state is not running
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
for another office at the same time
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to add I'm not especially in
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
favor of this or not in favor of this
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
but one thing that we could look at
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
would be the possibility that if the
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State announces or gives
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
his resignation effective
 
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
you know at on the election day
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
if he wanted to he or she wanted to run
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
for office then that person would not be
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is interesting I I miss most of the
 
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh hearing but obviously it was livelier
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
than I thought
 
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is ought to pass by
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Roy
 
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.290 align:start position:0%
representative Roy

01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.300 align:start position:0%

five seconds
 
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
does that require a vote Yes it does
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
that's uh shuitt and who was in broders
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
like I think that we have seen that uh
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
there are too many questions with the
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill the way it's written and
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
um I think retaining is is the best
 
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:53.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
I think that the bill warrants uh
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
retention and I think that it's
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
something that if we work on this will
 
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
be something that's better than what we
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
have now but I don't think that I do
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
think that having the
 
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
um the bill and and passing such a bill
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
in the long term is good
 
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
I think there's there's got to be a way
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
here to deal with the the concept of a
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
someone from running for anything I I
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
think that the the voters should decide
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
whether a person is acceptable or not
 
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
for an office and and I think there's
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
there with the retention here I think we
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
could probably find a way to
 
01:17:52.199 --> 01:17:53.630 align:start position:0%
could probably find a way to
to

01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
make both things happen
 
01:17:58.510 --> 01:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
a technical question that is what
 
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
happens if we're Team fails
 
01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
way of order when I'm chair would you
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
assign a sub committee to the retention
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
of this bill so that we could work on it
 
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
in an Earnest way
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes this should probably this would
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
go to the committee on government
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
organization which I believe represents
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay we can call it that yeah licensing
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
sure don't know you're doing license I'm
 
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
doing licensing yeah it's representative
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
Roy yes it's a subcommittee that
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
representative Roy is leading thank you
 
01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:49.100 align:start position:0%
it's a similarity yes that's fine
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
let me I'm going to rock the boat again
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
this sounds to me like we should all
 
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
think about it and talk to each other
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
about it and do this as a committee of
 
01:18:58.610 --> 01:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
I think this is uh not quite a
 
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
subcommittee issue
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
that's my thought I kind of like what
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
rep for example representative fellows
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm buying it but it was an
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
interesting idea uh resignation of the
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
day of I want to think about that kind
 
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
of thing I don't know that some
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
committee is the way to go my thoughts
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
in any event we won't do anything with
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
it until after crossover for sure and
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
probably not till
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh August I think is the earliest we can
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%

I would like to mention that
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
that was just my attempt to get rid of
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
some low-hanging fruit so I'm pretty
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
open either way on that bill but if
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
anyone has ideas let's start cobbling
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
together so then we'll get this bill
 
01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:55.820 align:start position:0%
back again we're not
 
01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:57.090 align:start position:0%
casting above

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
thinking about what that's my question
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about what that bill should say
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
oh I like the way it says what it says
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
now which apparently many of us don't
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
so should we um send our recommendations
 
01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
so should we um send our recommendations
into

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%

put them in the billfold

um
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
I would like to request that we exec it
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
on the next time we exec stuff
 
01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
the next time we exec things will be
 
01:23:40.739 --> 01:23:41.930 align:start position:0%

Friday

01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
we have two bills posted for exec and
 
01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
we'll fill in with as many others as we
 
01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:51.260 align:start position:0%
can get to all right
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
well in that case I will move
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 369 with
 
01:23:58.199 --> 01:23:59.510 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 369 with
Amendment

01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%

369. sorry the amendment one eight five
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
so as a mover I will say that this bill
 
01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:45.260 align:start position:0%
is was a request by professional
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
licensure certification to clarify uh
 
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
the use of of what they call Pam and to
 
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
eliminate an extra layer of
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
certification that they do not believe
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
is needed the amendment was developed by
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
the Board of Occupational therapists and
 
01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
they're in full support
 
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a little simpler and it
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
allows them to use
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
their training and experience
 
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Allegra would you care to
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
I think you encapsulated everything I
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
would say it's it's uh just a case of
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
simplifying uh something that's desired
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.470 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%

original bill
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
okay it
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
see it's under rule making
 
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.410 align:start position:0%
see it's under rule making
it

01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
adds the
 
01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.270 align:start position:0%

or lead electrical physical agent uh
 
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
physical agent modalities
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
and it's it just allows them to make
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
rules about about them and how they are
 
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
used and if
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
I remember the amendment now I'm sorry
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:48.300 align:start position:0%

that

01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%

want to bring forward
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
Madam chair you think we're ready for an
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
about Atlantic Standard Time
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's a valid motion we will
 
01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.410 align:start position:0%
uh that's a valid motion we will
definitely

01:30:26.410 --> 01:30:26.420 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
um I'll just say I made my case
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh last week week before last it's kind
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
of a blur
 
01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.090 align:start position:0%
of a blur
um

01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
I don't want to reiterate my speech I
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
think folks have fairly strong opinions
 
01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
on this but I will just say that
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I think overall it would just be a
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
great benefit
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I encourage folks who maybe are
 
01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
inclined to oppose it to talk to their
 
01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:10.129 align:start position:0%
inclined to oppose it to talk to their
constituents

01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.050 --> 01:31:14.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you uh manager I am
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
I think that this is a good bill and
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's a starter I think obviously
 
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to happen unless the
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
domino effect we heard about starts and
 
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
if someone doesn't push the first Domino
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's never going to happen so I think
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
this is a good start and it may spur the
 
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:39.900 align:start position:0%
federal uh legislators to actually do
 
01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
something so I think it's a good place
 
01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
to start
 
01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.030 align:start position:0%
to start
[Music]

01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
um I oppose this bill
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
um one of the my concerns is that it's
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
purported to have health benefits but
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
the reason in in specifically people
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
talk about heart attacks and strokes but
 
01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
people have heart attacks and strokes
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
because they have high blood pressure
 
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:32:12.530 --> 01:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
um blockage of the arteries they have
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
high cholesterol and to think that
 
01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.610 align:start position:0%
high cholesterol and to think that
um

01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
one losing one hour of sleep would cause
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
them to have a heart attack is just
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
makes no sense there's no common sense
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
to that uh there are issues related to
 
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
safety related driving and
 
01:32:37.209 --> 01:32:37.219 align:start position:0%
um particularly commuters in the morning
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
because with this bill should should it
 
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
ever work its way all the way through
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
will result in the sun coming up one
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
hour later
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the winter there's no impact on the
 
01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
summer at all one hour later in the
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
winter and as somebody who commuted 40
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
miles each way to work for 30 years the
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
conditions of the road in the winter
 
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
cause a lot of traffic accidents and
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
because the snow clouds haven't had a
 
01:33:15.850 --> 01:33:15.860 align:start position:0%
chance to clear away the snow
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
far more issues with safety in the
 
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
morning than in the evening and those
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
are those are just two of the points um
 
01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.729 align:start position:0%
are those are just two of the points um
students

01:33:25.729 --> 01:33:25.739 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh will be waiting for school in the
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
dark in the morning they're they're
 
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
already waiting in the dark in some
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
places it'll be darker for men for many
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
more months
 
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
and one of the things issue that was
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
raised by one of the speakers is that
 
01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.370 align:start position:0%
raised by one of the speakers is that
um

01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
has to do with students
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
going to school later high school
 
01:33:57.649 --> 01:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
students I think it's well documented
 
01:33:59.689 --> 01:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
that high school students have a very
 
01:34:02.330 --> 01:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
hard time waking up in the morning
 
01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
hard time waking up in the morning
and

01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
um it's just it just has to do with
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
hormones and this will actually be
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
asking them to wake up even one more
 
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
hour earlier
 
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
so those are the things I have to say
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:22.610 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
goalie

01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.649 --> 01:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I too will not
 
01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
support the OTP on this
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
um we heard in testimony that in
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
Atlantic time
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
um the latest we see Sunrise would be at
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
8 24 A.M
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
I mean it's not getting light out until
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
eight o'clock in the morning kids
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
standing out by the bus stops at 7 A.M
 
01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
um I think in the dark is inappropriate
 
01:34:47.699 --> 01:34:48.410 align:start position:0%
um I think in the dark is inappropriate
um

01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
it's a that's a that's a late Sunrise we
 
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
also also heard that
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
this was like comparing apples to
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
oranges and some of the pieces of
 
01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
legislation written
 
01:35:01.610 --> 01:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
in other states other states are looking
 
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
to do away with daylight savings this is
 
01:35:06.129 --> 01:35:06.139 align:start position:0%
moving us to the Atlantic time zone
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
totally different than what we're trying
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
to correlate between states
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
so for that reason
 
01:35:15.649 --> 01:35:15.659 align:start position:0%
um as well as the fact that as we hear
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
about health reasons and health issues
 
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
moving the clocks forward and back
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
um people do that all the time when they
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
travel they travel into different time
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
zones and we don't hear of a severe
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
health impact to those folks that are
 
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
traveling so for those reasons I will
 
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
not support you out fast thank you
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative Sherwood
 
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I too am not in support of this
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
specific bill
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
um I would favor doing away with
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time but my preference
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
would be the Eastern Time Zone as our
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
constant I think the argument that we
 
01:36:01.689 --> 01:36:01.699 align:start position:0%
heard from the broadcasters Association
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
was quite relevant regardless of what
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson said I would I
 
01:36:12.169 --> 01:36:12.179 align:start position:0%
would just point out that I think if we
 
01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:14.540 align:start position:0%
change to a completely different time
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
than New York's Zone we could be in
 
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
danger that they just plain would not
 
01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:23.300 align:start position:0%
send some of those programs to us
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't be reaching the
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
market that their advertisers would be
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
looking for so he wouldn't have them
 
01:36:35.209 --> 01:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
available to tape I think that the
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
health issues that have been raised are
 
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
in regards more to the changing back and
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
forth rather than to the specific time
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
zone that we settle on so I kind of
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
discount that argument so I will be
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
voting no on this
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
all right if someone comes in and says
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
let's make it Eastern Time Zone I would
 
01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
probably be willing to come after that
 
01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you we're already in the Eastern
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
um number of points one is uh the
 
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
concern of the broadcasters I mean given
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
well this bill only mentions uh Maine
 
01:37:18.169 --> 01:37:18.179 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts given that
 
01:37:18.179 --> 01:37:19.550 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts given that
Massachusetts

01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
the third existing legislation uh
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
mentions Connecticut I believe Rhode
 
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
Island and Connecticut depends on New
 
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
York this wouldn't go into effect unless
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
New York State changed and you know that
 
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
would give a large enough market that I
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to be a problem
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
for the broadcasters at that point so
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
we'd be fine
 
01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and as representative Roy said
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
um you know even if it doesn't go to
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
effect it might act as a push for uh
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
Congress to do something I don't
 
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
understand the uh concern about Eastern
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
versus I mean Eastern staying on
 
01:37:57.050 --> 01:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time or Atlantic I mean
 
01:37:59.570 --> 01:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
the times would be identical it's just
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
changing the name
 
01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.810 align:start position:0%
changing the name
so

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't understand why some people
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
like that maybe I'm missing something
 
01:38:10.689 --> 01:38:10.699 align:start position:0%
as far as the schools uh you know kids
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
uh going to school in the dark
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason why if that's a
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
problem the schools can't decide to
 
01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
start an hour later
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
as far as I know
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
and as far as the health stuff and
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
people are saying the travel doesn't
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
cause problems I mean it's generally
 
01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:28.860 align:start position:0%
known that travel across time zones
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
actually does cause stress and uh I
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't have any statistics but stress is
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
known to uh exacerbate various health
 
01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
problems including heart issues so
 
01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
so I don't think you can take that as a
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
and also it's a small segment of the
 
01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
population it'll do that every year
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
instead of the entire population which
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
you know includes people that don't
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
travel and maybe physically can't travel
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
because of their health so this would
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
affect dramatically more people than
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
traveling so I mean given all that I do
 
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
support this
 
01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:03.050 align:start position:0%
support this
um

01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
and I think it's good to at least get
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know push this along and see what
 
01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:13.189 align:start position:0%
you know push this along and see what
happens

01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
um yes I I think yeah I think there are
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
no technological issues people will have
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
electricity this Century so Machinery
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
they can figure out what time it is on
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
computers TV stations should be able to
 
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
figure it out I'm a co-sponsor on this
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill I will vote for it
 
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
to stop the switching
 
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:36.590 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
Pearson

01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair let's let's not
 
01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
get confused uh you know the old saying
 
01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:41.870 align:start position:0%
get confused uh you know the old saying
is

01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
um you know you want to find out what's
 
01:39:44.649 --> 01:39:44.659 align:start position:0%
actually going to go on read the bill
 
01:39:47.810 --> 01:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a me too Bill okay
 
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
this is not the state of New Hampshire
 
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
moving to the Atlantic time zone
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
for the sake of moving to the time zone
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know when you look at
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
especially the middle part of it lines
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
18 19 20. this requires Maine and
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to make the move so from
 
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
an economic standpoint
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
the state of New if Maine and
 
01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts moved to the Atlantic time
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
zone what choice do we have we are so
 
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
Reliant economically
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
as a region simply because New England
 
01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
so the states are so small
 
01:40:23.570 --> 01:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
that this would be massively problematic
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
to have made in New Hampshire being at
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
different times than New Hampshire so
 
01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
this is not it's not confuses here this
 
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
isn't us just going off on our own here
 
01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
this is us saying that hey when when the
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
the crazy flow chart begins to to drop
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
the dominoes
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
that we fall in line with that and you
 
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
know as far as the broadcasters go
 
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:44.689 align:start position:0%
know as far as the broadcasters go
yeah

01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:40:46.850 --> 01:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
Canada has more time zones than we do
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
when they figure out how to do it up
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
there the Boston Market is you know this
 
01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.010 align:start position:0%
there the Boston Market is you know this
isn't

01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
Sheboygan here this the Boston media
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
Market is substantial so
 
01:40:59.810 --> 01:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
you know with with the
 
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
most television broadcasts not being
 
01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
live anymore
 
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
I I just I don't really see the this
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
being such a massive struggle to watch
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
TV anyway so let's not forget what the
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
bill says and what it doesn't say you
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
know we're not like I said we're not
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
doing this on our own this is this is
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
involving actions about the begin in a
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
regional effort so I will support it
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
representative Allegra yeah much of what
 
01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
I was going to say has just been said
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
but I want to emphasize again what uh
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and lekka said
 
01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:35.870 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and lekka said
um

01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's more of a lack of interest in
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
adapting to the new situation than it is
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh that it's going to cause uh
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
well in the words of the the broadcast
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
industry Representatives
 
01:41:52.330 --> 01:41:52.340 align:start position:0%
the change would be frightening
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
cataclysmic and a crushing blow and when
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
I hear that I can't help but think of uh
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
you know the change in the Millennium uh
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
21 years ago uh people just had to adapt
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
I can't believe that with what we have
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of computers we can't figure
 
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
out how to adjust our programming
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is it may be a
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
relatively minor point but we do stick
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
out into the Atlantic Ocean and uh so
 
01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:20.750 align:start position:0%
out into the Atlantic Ocean and uh so
this

01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
Bill actually reflects astrophysical
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
reality and the rest of it is really
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
just man-made and can be adjusted so
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'll I tend to support this book
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative font now
 
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I too will support this bill
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
in theory if uh if nothing else I I
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
support the illumination of the time
 
01:42:46.370 --> 01:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
changes and whether that's done by
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
switching to Atlantic time staying with
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
eastern Time or eliminating daylight
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
savings time I don't have a preference
 
01:42:55.129 --> 01:42:55.139 align:start position:0%
as to how they do it I think there were
 
01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
enough safeguards in this bill because
 
01:42:59.649 --> 01:42:59.659 align:start position:0%
of the Domino
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
effects of the other states that um is
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
it more will
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
um the show our intent to support those
 
01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
changes so I'll support it
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative scitec
 
01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair I really don't like going
 
01:43:23.290 --> 01:43:23.300 align:start position:0%
last you're not oh oh good okay because
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to support it and everything I
 
01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:28.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to say has been said
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
but the only thing I want to do that's
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
helpful is before it representative
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
Schmidt says that uh it's daylight
 
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
saving there's no s on that word
 
01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate the great correction
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay I believe that's everyone who has
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
yet to speak and yes I know you can stop
 
01:43:56.209 --> 01:43:56.219 align:start position:0%
raising your hands if you want to speak
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
again I bet you down
 
01:43:59.159 --> 01:44:03.109 align:start position:0%
again I bet you down
okay

01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schmidt is the last
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
person who hasn't yet spoken so do you
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
have the floor
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
okay after it representing scitec has
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
stolen my thunder uh yes this is an
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
especially an annoyance to me to hear it
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
called daylight savings time when it's
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
called Daylight Saving Time Savings or
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
something else uh but I I sponsored a
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
similar Bill like 17 or 18 years ago so
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
uh this is a concept with whose Time Has
 
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
Come uh no pun intended but the reality
 
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
is has been said several times but
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
nothing will happen in New Hampshire
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
until uh Massachusetts has made up its
 
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
mind and if it goes we gotta go we do
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
not want to be out of sync with
 
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh with the interlinking
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
of our economies and as far as the
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
school student situation school time is
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
something which can and should be
 
01:45:03.709 --> 01:45:03.719 align:start position:0%
adjusted this is something which our
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
Educators have been complaining about
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
for years saying that early School times
 
01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
are not not healthy don't make any sense
 
01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:13.820 align:start position:0%
it's time to get for the school
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
districts and so forth to get off the
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
dime and get on time so this is
 
01:45:22.729 --> 01:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
something we should get in sync with
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
because if it matches goes we have to be
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
all right new new person heard from
 
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative Baroda
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so while I was listening to
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
everyone I thought what happens if
 
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
States decide to eliminate daylight
 
01:45:44.209 --> 01:45:44.219 align:start position:0%
saving time and just no change the clock
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
rather than going to Atlantic time I
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
heard two different people testifying on
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
that and one said we can do it no
 
01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
problem the other one says it would take
 
01:45:58.129 --> 01:45:58.139 align:start position:0%
an act of Congress and I'm not sure
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
which I believe but yeah they mentioned
 
01:46:04.729 --> 01:46:04.739 align:start position:0%
the 1966 permanent time zone yes I think
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to go to permanent daylight
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
saving time we would have to have an act
 
01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
of Congress we want to go to Atlantic
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
Standard time we could do it without
 
01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
such a vote but in any event the
 
01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
arguments about being out of phase with
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts still apply
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay on the repeats representative
 
01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:27.050 align:start position:0%
okay on the repeats representative
Schultz

01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
Schultz
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
I actually had new information even
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
though I'm tempted to re-argue my points
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
as always
 
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm consistent anyways um
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
so first of all I meant to send two
 
01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
pieces of research out one was that
 
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
responding to Scott spradling's very
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
good uh testimony even though it opposed
 
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
my bill I really took him seriously
 
01:46:53.090 --> 01:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
there actually is a lot of of literature
 
01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
out there maybe it's more on the opinion
 
01:46:59.450 --> 01:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
genre but broadcasters across the
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
country are frustrated that the whole
 
01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
time zone discussion around broadcasters
 
01:47:07.729 --> 01:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
actually has a significant Eastern Time
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
Zone bias and so that will always be
 
01:47:14.209 --> 01:47:14.219 align:start position:0%
occurring for every other group not in
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
the Eastern Time Zone I meant to send
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
some of that literature or at least a
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
link to one or two of those opinion
 
01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:24.659 align:start position:0%
stories about that the second bit of
 
01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
research that I meant to was to clarify
 
01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
my answer to representative goalie's
 
01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
point about traveling and time zones and
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
I think someone briefly touched on that
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
two but there is a lot of research
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
because I answered this question the way
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
he asked it correctly but it is
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
definitely true whether you it's just
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
from basic a jet lag or studies on
 
01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
stress there is a significant uh amount
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
of research that shows that traveling
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
across time zones does create a
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
difficulty but that's not what this bill
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
does anyway but yes there is Def I
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
should have sent that research out and I
 
01:48:05.639 --> 01:48:07.070 align:start position:0%
should have sent that research out and I
apologize

01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative fellows
 
01:48:12.649 --> 01:48:12.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I apologize for
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
raising my hand 20 times
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
um I something I noticed over the
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
weekend is I think there's a technical
 
01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
issue and it has to do with when the
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
Things become effective
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
so the first thing that for anything to
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
Really Happen the first thing that has
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
to happen is section three the
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
contingency that the other states
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
adopted that that part's fine but then
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
it says after after three one and two
 
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
both become effective and section two is
 
01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
when the state is going to ask
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
the U.S Department of Transportation if
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
we can make the change
 
01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.070 align:start position:0%
we can make the change
and

01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
that's what most States pass this also
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
says at the same time we're just going
 
01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
to apply to have our time zone change
 
01:49:09.169 --> 01:49:09.179 align:start position:0%
that we're actually going to change it
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
in State Statute that's what section one
 
01:49:12.119 --> 01:49:16.189 align:start position:0%
in State Statute that's what section one
does

01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:22.010 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I agree with Sally
 
01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
sorry I kept raising my hand I'm glad
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
you fully mentioned because I didn't
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
know why it kept dropping off
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out that I
 
01:49:37.609 --> 01:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
believe it was representative lakas said
 
01:49:40.729 --> 01:49:40.739 align:start position:0%
that this wouldn't happen until New York
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
changed and I just want to point out New
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
York is not mentioned in the bill at all
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's just dependent on Maine and
 
01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:50.229 align:start position:0%
it's just dependent on Maine and
Massachusetts

01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative yeah the reason I
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned New York is that Although our
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
bill just mentions made in Massachusetts
 
01:50:03.770 --> 01:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
there's a uh a similar Bill and you know
 
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
similar statute Massachusetts or maybe
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's uh in process that one mentions
 
01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it mentions but
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
mentions Connecticut and on maybe Rhode
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
Island and the Connecticut one
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
definitely mentions New York and so you
 
01:50:21.050 --> 01:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
know New York would have to go first
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
then Connecticut could go then
 
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts then us so although it's
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
indirect ours does depend on New York
 
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
yes unless Massachusetts changes we're
 
01:50:34.729 --> 01:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
Connecticut or Massachusetts yeah it's
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
but definitely we don't
 
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't say we're going it
 
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
alone and I haven't heard anybody saying
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
we should be going it along
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
all right any other comments questions
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.609 --> 01:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:50:58.250 --> 01:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
I just for a little bit of clarification
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh the bills in Massachusetts and other
 
01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.030 align:start position:0%
uh the bills in Massachusetts and other
states

01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
are those dealing with Atlantic time
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
zones or those dealing with just doing
 
01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
away with
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
daylight savings and staying on the
 
01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
Eastern Time Zone
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
the only know about things is
 
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the bill that they had
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
lot their last term was to go to
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
Atlantic time
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
the however they're in a new session and
 
01:51:25.129 --> 01:51:25.139 align:start position:0%
I don't know what their current bill
 
01:51:25.139 --> 01:51:27.470 align:start position:0%
I don't know what their current bill
says

01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
I can address that
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative fellows thank you
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
um the bill that Massachusetts had two
 
01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
years ago it you could you I could go
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
into their system and see the bill but
 
01:51:46.129 --> 01:51:46.139 align:start position:0%
it was never in probably the equivalent
 
01:51:49.250 --> 01:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
of our introduced because if you try to
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
go into their system and find that bill
 
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
now the one from two years ago you will
 
01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
not find it
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
yes thank you any other comments
 
01:52:03.169 --> 01:52:03.179 align:start position:0%
right it's like most people have spoken
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
their piece the motion is ought to pass
 
01:52:08.450 --> 01:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
made by representative Schultz and the
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%

02:56:00.410 --> 02:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
from across the fields
 
02:56:02.809 --> 02:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I'm going
 
02:56:05.630 --> 02:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
oh I qua I just
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
well I guess it's going to be on the
 
02:56:10.309 --> 02:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
public thing and that's fine but
 
02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
um my doctor said I'm definitely in in
 
02:56:14.269 --> 02:56:14.279 align:start position:0%
the current group that's supposed to get
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
the coveted vaccine because I am that
 
02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:18.050 align:start position:0%
the coveted vaccine because I am that
ill

02:56:18.050 --> 02:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
ill
 
02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately
 
02:56:24.469 --> 02:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh and I don't get my first shot until
 
02:56:24.479 --> 02:56:27.250 align:start position:0%
uh and I don't get my first shot until
May

02:56:27.250 --> 02:56:27.260 align:start position:0%
May
 
02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
so while the risk may be is lower it's
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
not as low as it was last summer and I'm
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
scared that
 
02:56:37.790 --> 02:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
I mean my doctor thinks that I would
 
02:56:39.469 --> 02:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
definitely be someone who would be
 
02:56:41.570 --> 02:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
likely to be hospitalized if I caught
 
02:56:46.490 --> 02:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
covid so I probably not going and I feel
 
02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
sad that
 
02:56:50.630 --> 02:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
they haven't been able to figure out a
 
02:56:51.650 --> 02:56:51.660 align:start position:0%

02:58:46.730 --> 02:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
look out and the building got more and
 
02:58:48.410 --> 02:58:48.420 align:start position:0%

03:04:01.130 --> 03:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
know gold star Mother's Day uh the first
 
03:04:03.410 --> 03:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
Sunday after Easter Portsmouth peace
 
03:04:06.650 --> 03:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
treaty day on September 5th maybe Lyme
 
03:04:10.010 --> 03:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
disease prevention month and so on
 
03:04:13.130 --> 03:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
um this bill is identical to when I
 
03:04:14.990 --> 03:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
introduced last year that went through
 
03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
the labor committee
 
03:04:19.250 --> 03:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
um which recommended passage 20 to zero
 
03:04:21.950 --> 03:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
and then it uh left the house via the
 
03:04:23.570 --> 03:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
consent calendar before
 
03:04:25.730 --> 03:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
covet arrived and kind of shut down the
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
03:04:29.570 --> 03:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
so real quick uh this is a little
 
03:04:31.969 --> 03:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
background on the event in Dover
 
03:04:31.979 --> 03:04:32.570 align:start position:0%
background on the event in Dover
um

03:04:32.570 --> 03:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:34.550 --> 03:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know for those people who have been
 
03:04:35.929 --> 03:04:35.939 align:start position:0%
to our city and I think the committee
 
03:04:37.309 --> 03:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
has a couple members from our city
 
03:04:39.889 --> 03:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
there's several Mills uh sort of
 
03:04:43.610 --> 03:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
dominating our downtown one being a 735
 
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
foot long structure that runs the length
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
of our
 
03:04:49.610 --> 03:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh main main drag
 
03:04:51.410 --> 03:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
um it's home to Lofts and breweries now
 
03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
but in the 1800s it was a site of a
 
03:04:55.370 --> 03:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
lively textile mill
 
03:04:57.650 --> 03:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
in those days women performed most of
 
03:05:00.050 --> 03:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
the work in the Mills they worked looms
 
03:05:01.490 --> 03:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
and weaving machines in the cloth making
 
03:05:04.010 --> 03:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
process it was dangerous it was
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
unpleasant work and the pay was low even
 
03:05:09.170 --> 03:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
by historical standards
 
03:05:11.389 --> 03:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
um just before this uh turnout as they
 
03:05:13.610 --> 03:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
called it back then the Mills owner cut
 
03:05:16.910 --> 03:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
their wages by uh 10 to those days
 
03:05:19.190 --> 03:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
amounted to a nickel so they made just
 
03:05:22.910 --> 03:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
50 cents and they lost a nickel a day
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
don't Christmas or excuse me the day
 
03:05:27.050 --> 03:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
after Christmas on 1830 half of the
 
03:05:30.830 --> 03:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
Mills 800 plus uh Workforce walked out
 
03:05:33.170 --> 03:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh the pay cut was the primary grievance
 
03:05:35.389 --> 03:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
but they also were had concerns about
 
03:05:38.929 --> 03:05:38.939 align:start position:0%
quotas and uh and safety and so on
 
03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
um the newspaper account at the time did
 
03:05:44.330 --> 03:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
not look fondly uh on this
 
03:05:46.670 --> 03:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
um event and I'm just gonna quote from
 
03:05:48.530 --> 03:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
Foster's Daily Democrat which still
 
03:05:48.540 --> 03:05:49.969 align:start position:0%
Foster's Daily Democrat which still
exists

03:05:49.969 --> 03:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
exists
 
03:05:49.979 --> 03:05:50.630 align:start position:0%
exists
um

03:05:50.630 --> 03:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:52.730 --> 03:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
quote a general turnout of the girls
 
03:05:54.889 --> 03:05:54.899 align:start position:0%
employed in the cotton factories in this
 
03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
town to a number of six or eight hundred
 
03:05:59.870 --> 03:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
took place on Friday last on account of
 
03:06:02.510 --> 03:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
some imaginary grievance it has We
 
03:06:04.370 --> 03:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
Believe turned out to their cost as well
 
03:06:07.849 --> 03:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
as disgrace and since that time many
 
03:06:10.309 --> 03:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
have returned to work in all who are
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
permitted will without doubt return in
 
03:06:14.990 --> 03:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
the course of a few days the girls on
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
leaving the factory yard formed a
 
03:06:18.950 --> 03:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
procession nearly half a mile in length
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
and marched through town with Marshall
 
03:06:24.110 --> 03:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
Music accompanied by a roar of artillery
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
the hole presented one of the most
 
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
disgusting scenes ever witnessed
 
03:06:31.730 --> 03:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh so that's the newspaper account it
 
03:06:33.769 --> 03:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
did correctly predict that the workers
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
would return to the mill and they did uh
 
03:06:37.849 --> 03:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
three days after the incident nearly all
 
03:06:39.410 --> 03:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
were back there
 
03:06:42.410 --> 03:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
workplace uh no better than before
 
03:06:45.050 --> 03:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
but it was not uh by any means a total
 
03:06:47.929 --> 03:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
you know a total loss it inspired uh
 
03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
female Mill workers in Lowell and
 
03:06:52.429 --> 03:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
elsewhere who had heard about what
 
03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
happened in Dover uh and adjusted their
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
own approaches uh accordingly uh in a
 
03:07:00.110 --> 03:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
similar walk out in Lowell was
 
03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:01.250 align:start position:0%
similar walk out in Lowell was
successful

03:07:01.250 --> 03:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
successful
 
03:07:03.050 --> 03:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh history has not forgotten this event
 
03:07:05.090 --> 03:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
by any means but it is not widely known
 
03:07:07.490 --> 03:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
in our state and it's not entirely
 
03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
widely known even here in Dover
 
03:07:10.439 --> 03:07:11.150 align:start position:0%
widely known even here in Dover
um

03:07:11.150 --> 03:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:13.730 --> 03:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
dover's former librarian Kathy beaudwin
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
was instrumental in collecting historic
 
03:07:18.889 --> 03:07:18.899 align:start position:0%
details about this event but I certainly
 
03:07:20.170 --> 03:07:20.180 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for our state and our city
 
03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
and our region just um just for all of
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
us to sort of know a little bit more
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
about it
 
03:07:29.870 --> 03:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
so with that I I asked the committee to
 
03:07:31.250 --> 03:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
recommend passage and I'll certainly
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
attempt to answer any questions
 
03:07:35.690 --> 03:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
03:07:44.330 --> 03:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
wait a second Peter Smith
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
well since I was uh referenced even
 
03:07:54.889 --> 03:07:54.899 align:start position:0%
though that not named
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
um as one of the Dover representatives
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I remember that day very well
 
03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:01.630 align:start position:0%
and I remember that day very well
um

03:08:01.630 --> 03:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:05.389 --> 03:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
I thought the women all looked uh fine
 
03:08:06.650 --> 03:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
and didn't think there was anything
 
03:08:10.610 --> 03:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
disgraceful about it but seriously uh
 
03:08:13.490 --> 03:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
the reality is that it was very
 
03:08:15.950 --> 03:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
significant because For the First Time
 
03:08:19.190 --> 03:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
In in this country a group of women
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
stood up I'm not sure there had been any
 
03:08:26.269 --> 03:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
labor actions before uh this one but
 
03:08:28.750 --> 03:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
certainly no none involving all women
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
they stood up for their own needs and
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
rights uh and and and and it turned out
 
03:08:39.170 --> 03:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
as they called it then so uh
 
03:08:41.269 --> 03:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
representative Conley
 
03:08:45.230 --> 03:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
um what was the committee that heard it
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
last year voted 20 to nothing you say
 
03:08:51.530 --> 03:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
um and was it and it was on the consent
 
03:08:51.540 --> 03:08:52.389 align:start position:0%
um and was it and it was on the consent
calendar

03:08:52.389 --> 03:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
03:08:55.610 --> 03:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh and is it your opinion that it would
 
03:08:58.370 --> 03:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
have uh passed the Senate as well had it
 
03:08:59.929 --> 03:08:59.939 align:start position:0%
been able to go through the usual
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
03:09:02.570 --> 03:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:04.370 --> 03:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:09:04.380 --> 03:09:05.450 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

03:09:05.450 --> 03:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:07.610 --> 03:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
hesitate to predict what the other body
 
03:09:10.849 --> 03:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
would do in any matter but I certainly
 
03:09:13.010 --> 03:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
would hope given the the path it had in
 
03:09:14.330 --> 03:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
the house and the lack of resistance
 
03:09:16.790 --> 03:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
that they would have had a similar
 
03:09:19.730 --> 03:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
response uh in that chamber
 
03:09:24.769 --> 03:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:27.050 --> 03:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you what committee did it go to
 
03:09:30.530 --> 03:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Conley labor
 
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
yep thank you
 
03:09:36.769 --> 03:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
03:09:40.969 --> 03:09:40.979 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you take
 
03:09:40.979 --> 03:09:42.290 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you take
care

03:09:42.290 --> 03:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:09:44.269 --> 03:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:09:54.370 --> 03:09:54.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman yes Ms van thanks uh I
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
would like to testify on this bill
 
03:10:01.439 --> 03:10:03.590 align:start position:0%
would like to testify on this bill
please

03:10:03.590 --> 03:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:10:06.290 --> 03:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh as a person who taught New Hampshire
 
03:10:08.929 --> 03:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
history for a number of years I used to
 
03:10:12.650 --> 03:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
teach this turnout and it's hugely
 
03:10:16.370 --> 03:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
important as a mark of people coming
 
03:10:18.410 --> 03:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
together and working for better
 
03:10:21.889 --> 03:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
conditions and the fact that so many of
 
03:10:24.530 --> 03:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
them were young women who had left the
 
03:10:27.530 --> 03:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
farms in order to work in the Mills with
 
03:10:30.349 --> 03:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
the promise that they would be cared for
 
03:10:33.170 --> 03:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
appropriately I I just think it's an
 
03:10:34.969 --> 03:10:34.979 align:start position:0%
amazing story and I'd like to see us
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
adopt this day
 
03:10:38.330 --> 03:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:10:43.790 --> 03:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for your
 
03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:54.110 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for your
testimony

03:10:54.110 --> 03:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:54.120 --> 03:10:55.309 align:start position:0%
 
we're

03:10:55.309 --> 03:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:11:11.650 --> 03:11:11.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:14.990 --> 03:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
Excuse Me Miss tentarelli
 
03:11:17.210 --> 03:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for this opportunity
 
03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of HB 170.
 
03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know the mills in New Hampshire and
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in the early 1800s
 
03:11:27.889 --> 03:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
provided the first chance for large
 
03:11:29.990 --> 03:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of young women to leave home and
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
earn their own livings but it also
 
03:11:35.269 --> 03:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
provided the first opportunity for women
 
03:11:37.790 --> 03:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
to band together and learn how to use
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
their civic voices
 
03:11:43.490 --> 03:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
the 1828 strike didn't succeed getting
 
03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
better pay and equal rights for the mill
 
03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
girls in Dover but it did strengthen the
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
resolve of working women to speak up for
 
03:11:51.359 --> 03:11:52.670 align:start position:0%
resolve of working women to speak up for
themselves

03:11:52.670 --> 03:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:11:55.849 --> 03:11:55.859 align:start position:0%
about 15 years later Sarah Bagley of
 
03:11:58.370 --> 03:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
Candia was working in a mill in Lowell
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
when she organized and became president
 
03:12:04.730 --> 03:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
of the first female labor union in the
 
03:12:06.830 --> 03:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
country calling for improved working
 
03:12:10.670 --> 03:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
conditions and a 10-hour work day
 
03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
she testified in the Massachusetts
 
03:12:16.730 --> 03:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
legislature all to also to no avail
 
03:12:19.790 --> 03:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
but the game was in women learning to
 
03:12:22.790 --> 03:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
speak up for themselves and others over
 
03:12:25.070 --> 03:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
the next decades many women were active
 
03:12:27.469 --> 03:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
in the abolition movement using their
 
03:12:30.410 --> 03:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
civic voices for racial Justice
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
and of course following the Civil War
 
03:12:35.450 --> 03:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
women around the country spoke up
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
demanding women's voting rights become
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
the law of the land
 
03:12:41.929 --> 03:12:41.939 align:start position:0%
so the Dover Mill girls should be
 
03:12:44.929 --> 03:12:44.939 align:start position:0%
appropriately commemorated as early
 
03:12:47.929 --> 03:12:47.939 align:start position:0%
examples of women finding and using
 
03:12:51.170 --> 03:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
their civic voices for themselves and
 
03:12:55.010 --> 03:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
others for equality and human rights so
 
03:12:58.490 --> 03:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support HB 170 and thank
 
03:13:01.130 --> 03:13:01.140 align:start position:0%

03:13:04.910 --> 03:13:04.920 align:start position:0%

03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
history and and was very pleased to see
 
03:13:38.990 --> 03:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
that right here in New Hampshire we had
 
03:13:41.150 --> 03:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
some of the earliest female voices
 
03:13:44.210 --> 03:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
speaking up for civic rights
 
03:13:45.889 --> 03:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
03:13:51.230 --> 03:13:51.240 align:start position:0%

bill seeking to place granity's birthday

her long work for democracy in the
 
03:16:01.250 --> 03:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
United States as you all know she uh her
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
most famous story of course is that she
 
03:16:06.110 --> 03:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
walked across the United States ending
 
03:16:08.990 --> 03:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
up in Washington in order to draw
 
03:16:12.050 --> 03:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
attention to the issues of campaign
 
03:16:13.570 --> 03:16:13.580 align:start position:0%
Finance reform
 
03:16:17.870 --> 03:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
she was at that time in her 90s I
 
03:16:20.269 --> 03:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
actually knew granny D quite briefly I
 
03:16:22.190 --> 03:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
was a nursery school teacher and her
 
03:16:23.809 --> 03:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law's nursery school and I
 
03:16:25.610 --> 03:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
used to sometimes see Granny D in the
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
kitchen she was an amazing indomitable
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
woman and I very much hope that the
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
committee will
 
03:16:37.969 --> 03:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
move this forward again as with the mill
 
03:16:41.570 --> 03:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
girls it was a bill that was put forward
 
03:16:45.410 --> 03:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
last year and was lost to the pandemic
 
03:16:49.130 --> 03:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
so I would be delighted to see Granny D
 
03:16:51.349 --> 03:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
honored as she should be another
 
03:16:53.690 --> 03:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
indomitable New Hampshire woman
 
03:16:56.269 --> 03:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:17:01.130 --> 03:17:01.140 align:start position:0%

03:17:09.830 --> 03:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
first met granny D before I'd even been
 
03:17:12.230 --> 03:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire when she walked through
 
03:17:14.750 --> 03:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
America in Arkansas
 
03:17:17.870 --> 03:17:17.880 align:start position:0%

03:17:20.090 --> 03:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
across she had people walking with her
 
03:17:25.730 --> 03:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
it was an amazing thing to do I am 65. I
 
03:17:28.429 --> 03:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
am just in awe of the idea that she
 
03:17:31.790 --> 03:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
cared so deeply about our democracy that
 
03:17:35.030 --> 03:17:35.040 align:start position:0%

03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for her cause she did
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%

03:19:12.650 --> 03:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
excuse me Madam chair I thought there
 
03:19:14.450 --> 03:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
were several people who were signed up
 
03:19:18.290 --> 03:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
to speak uh Brian Beale from Alton Bay
 
03:19:21.830 --> 03:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps and I read three names listed
 
03:19:25.010 --> 03:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
that are raising their hands
 
03:19:25.020 --> 03:19:27.050 align:start position:0%
that are raising their hands
I

03:19:27.050 --> 03:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:19:27.060 --> 03:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
I
okay

03:19:30.230 --> 03:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:40.969 --> 03:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:46.370 --> 03:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:49.309 --> 03:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
he's been promoted he needs to mute him
 
03:19:58.990 --> 03:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:01.570 --> 03:20:01.580 align:start position:0%
there hello
 
03:20:03.530 --> 03:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair may I have uh
 
03:20:07.730 --> 03:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
roughly four or five minutes
 
03:20:09.410 --> 03:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
I would
 
03:20:11.330 --> 03:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
less would probably be better but please
 
03:20:13.490 --> 03:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and start my name is
 
03:20:15.290 --> 03:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
Dennis Burke I'm calling from Phoenix
 
03:20:17.690 --> 03:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
Arizona uh I'd like to add the
 
03:20:19.010 --> 03:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
perspective of thousands of people
 
03:20:21.170 --> 03:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire who continue to
 
03:20:23.630 --> 03:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
take instruction and inspiration from
 
03:20:25.730 --> 03:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
granny D's work she walked through many
 
03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
States including Arizona made friends in
 
03:20:30.410 --> 03:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
all of them even Texas where in fact
 
03:20:32.269 --> 03:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
Ross Perot gave her his private number
 
03:20:34.130 --> 03:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
and said call whatever she needed it
 
03:20:36.050 --> 03:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely anything she said thank you
 
03:20:37.849 --> 03:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
very much but reminded him that she was
 
03:20:40.190 --> 03:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
walking to protest not Embrace big money
 
03:20:42.769 --> 03:20:42.779 align:start position:0%
in politics but she added that having a
 
03:20:44.570 --> 03:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
billionaire offer unlimited resources
 
03:20:46.190 --> 03:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
was something everyone should experience
 
03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
at least once
 
03:20:50.450 --> 03:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
Ross took no offense he invited her to
 
03:20:51.889 --> 03:20:51.899 align:start position:0%
speak at the reform party's National
 
03:20:53.630 --> 03:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
Convention where she brought down the
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
house and said no to a floor nomination
 
03:20:58.010 --> 03:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
as their vice presidential candidate
 
03:21:00.410 --> 03:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
which was not bad for a Democrat from
 
03:21:02.929 --> 03:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but the reason for that
 
03:21:05.210 --> 03:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
was the subject of her remarks of her
 
03:21:06.830 --> 03:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
walk and really of her life was the
 
03:21:09.050 --> 03:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan defense of human scale
 
03:21:12.050 --> 03:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
democracy where we all participate as
 
03:21:15.710 --> 03:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
equals her commitment to the human scale
 
03:21:17.929 --> 03:21:17.939 align:start position:0%
goes back to her work to protect an
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
Inuit commit a community in Alaska from
 
03:21:23.690 --> 03:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
unnecessary nuclear testing in the 1950s
 
03:21:26.210 --> 03:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
she and her husband Jim senior were
 
03:21:27.830 --> 03:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
successful in that and maintained
 
03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
lifelong friendships with the people of
 
03:21:31.790 --> 03:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
that Village when she learned of the
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
terrible poverty in here in Arizona on
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
the native reservations she learned that
 
03:21:38.929 --> 03:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
much of their money came from making
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
rugs and selling them so she started
 
03:21:42.650 --> 03:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
making rugs and selling them and sending
 
03:21:45.230 --> 03:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
all the money to the reservations and
 
03:21:49.370 --> 03:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
also supported the the the tribes with
 
03:21:51.370 --> 03:21:51.380 align:start position:0%
work in Congress
 
03:21:53.690 --> 03:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
what she learned in those efforts in
 
03:21:55.309 --> 03:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
those years was that her members of
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
Congress were open to her arguments and
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
later when she returned to those offices
 
03:22:02.570 --> 03:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
to seek help in reading campaigns of
 
03:22:05.809 --> 03:22:05.819 align:start position:0%
clearly corrupt uh donations she was
 
03:22:08.450 --> 03:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
rebuffed and she was a citizen scorned
 
03:22:11.090 --> 03:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
at that point at age 90 her real work in
 
03:22:13.809 --> 03:22:13.819 align:start position:0%
life began as a messenger of democracy
 
03:22:16.130 --> 03:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
and her message really was a product of
 
03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire town halls and it struck a
 
03:22:20.929 --> 03:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
chord across the U.S and across the
 
03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
world reporters in fact came to walk
 
03:22:25.130 --> 03:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
with her from the UK from Germany
 
03:22:27.290 --> 03:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
Scandinavia and Japan in fact her little
 
03:22:29.030 --> 03:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
book of speeches
 
03:22:32.030 --> 03:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
sells as much today in those countries
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
as it does here she walked 3 200 miles
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
despite a bad back emphysema and a
 
03:22:39.469 --> 03:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
terrible set of leg cramps every every
 
03:22:41.570 --> 03:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
evening when she stopped walking she
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
climbed mountain ranges during blizzards
 
03:22:45.769 --> 03:22:45.779 align:start position:0%
and when snow closed the roads into
 
03:22:48.889 --> 03:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
Washington she crossed country skied the
 
03:22:51.290 --> 03:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
last 180 miles of her epic journey into
 
03:22:54.230 --> 03:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
Washington she got her bill passed over
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
Mitch McConnell's objection he had said
 
03:22:58.490 --> 03:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
that campaign reform would pass when
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
hell freeze is over and she said take a
 
03:23:02.330 --> 03:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
picture of me on these skis and send it
 
03:23:07.010 --> 03:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
to Mitch which happened uh at age uh 93
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
she traveled the country to register
 
03:23:10.370 --> 03:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
working women to vote sometimes by
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
taking over their jobs long enough for
 
03:23:13.969 --> 03:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
them to register and some of those jobs
 
03:23:16.370 --> 03:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
included feeding alligators in an
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
alligator park
 
03:23:19.910 --> 03:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
um being a mermaid at a mermaid Park a
 
03:23:21.889 --> 03:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
tending bar in the French Quarter of New
 
03:23:24.050 --> 03:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
Orleans uh and and all of that she was
 
03:23:26.690 --> 03:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
bringing attention to a voter
 
03:23:29.570 --> 03:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
registration uh efforts in in those
 
03:23:31.849 --> 03:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
States when she crossed Arizona we were
 
03:23:33.889 --> 03:23:33.899 align:start position:0%
working on a re on reforms to end the
 
03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
most egregious kinds of gerrymandering
 
03:23:38.570 --> 03:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
she reminded people of both parties the
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
demographics are changing and both
 
03:23:42.050 --> 03:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
parties have a stake in the creation of
 
03:23:44.269 --> 03:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
a fair system it passed handily as a
 
03:23:46.190 --> 03:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
ballot initiative and we enjoy it today
 
03:23:49.190 --> 03:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
in her mid and late 90s she traveled and
 
03:23:51.410 --> 03:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
walked across any state that was
 
03:23:53.330 --> 03:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
considering new approaches to democratic
 
03:23:55.729 --> 03:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
fairness and many of them passed and the
 
03:23:57.950 --> 03:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
late spring of 2004 when it suddenly
 
03:23:59.690 --> 03:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
looked like Senator Greg would run
 
03:24:02.090 --> 03:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
unopposed she ran for the U.S Senate
 
03:24:03.889 --> 03:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
knowing she had no chance of winning but
 
03:24:05.809 --> 03:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
that it would be a chance to walk across
 
03:24:07.969 --> 03:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
the state two or three times and make
 
03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
100 speeches about democracy and fair
 
03:24:13.190 --> 03:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
elections which is what she did uh I
 
03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
think she is whom you might want your
 
03:24:17.150 --> 03:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
grandchildren to know about remember as
 
03:24:19.370 --> 03:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
they craft their own long free
 
03:24:22.010 --> 03:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
productive and joyful lives we carry
 
03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
forward important messages for the Next
 
03:24:26.809 --> 03:24:26.819 align:start position:0%
Generation with statues of bronze or
 
03:24:29.170 --> 03:24:29.180 align:start position:0%
marble but sometimes just with words
 
03:24:31.370 --> 03:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
enshrined in law like like the bill
 
03:24:34.750 --> 03:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
before you now it is cheaper to do it
 
03:24:36.950 --> 03:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
the way you have in front of you then
 
03:24:39.650 --> 03:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
with bronze or marble which is very New
 
03:24:41.330 --> 03:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and very Doris you would have
 
03:24:43.670 --> 03:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
hated to pay more taxes even for her own
 
03:24:43.680 --> 03:24:45.229 align:start position:0%
hated to pay more taxes even for her own
statue

03:24:45.229 --> 03:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
statue
 
03:24:47.690 --> 03:24:47.700 align:start position:0%

him by seven years she is the iconic
 
03:24:57.590 --> 03:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
figure of the Granite State now and she
 
03:24:59.750 --> 03:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
represents the tough love of democracy
 
03:25:02.150 --> 03:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
that needs to be cherished and
 
03:25:04.370 --> 03:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
remembered now more than ever

good afternoon
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
um Dan weeks from Nashua New Hampshire I
 
03:25:27.410 --> 03:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
really appreciate this opportunity to
 
03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
testify briefly I'm not on top of a
 
03:25:32.450 --> 03:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
building but for my day job I work in
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
solar energy and this is a recent
 
03:25:36.229 --> 03:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
installation in Londonderry
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
um but I'm grateful for the chance to
 
03:25:39.650 --> 03:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
just give a quick personal perspective
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
on on why I strongly support this bill
 
03:25:44.330 --> 03:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
and hope that you will as well I grew up
 
03:25:45.650 --> 03:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
in the Monadnock area of New Hampshire
 
03:25:48.110 --> 03:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
in Temple I went to conval high school
 
03:25:51.050 --> 03:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
and when I was 17 as an unsuspecting
 
03:25:54.110 --> 03:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
teenager I had the chance to hear granny
 
03:25:56.690 --> 03:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
D give one of her first speeches on
 
03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
returning from that cross-country walk
 
03:26:01.070 --> 03:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
in the year 2000 when she spoke at
 
03:26:03.410 --> 03:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
conval which was the district where she
 
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
herself was from in Dublin and it lit a
 
03:26:08.570 --> 03:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
fire under me
 
03:26:11.690 --> 03:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
um and and a lot of my peers as well it
 
03:26:13.849 --> 03:26:13.859 align:start position:0%
was part of my becoming an active
 
03:26:16.729 --> 03:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
citizen concerning myself about the
 
03:26:19.370 --> 03:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
issue of democracy and integrity in our
 
03:26:23.030 --> 03:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
elections set me on a path that has in
 
03:26:25.250 --> 03:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
many ways defined my life ever since I
 
03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
feel very privileged to after going away
 
03:26:29.809 --> 03:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire for Americorps and
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
for college to be back here raising my
 
03:26:34.130 --> 03:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
three young kids and and making a life
 
03:26:36.889 --> 03:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
here for my family as a as an active
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
Citizen and I do really take inspiration
 
03:26:42.889 --> 03:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
from granny D for that I was privileged
 
03:26:46.070 --> 03:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
for several years to lead the non-profit
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization open democracy
 
03:26:50.809 --> 03:26:50.819 align:start position:0%
which he founded which continues to work
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
for campaign Finance reform and I
 
03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
believe you will hear from some of the
 
03:26:56.090 --> 03:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
current staff of open democracy as well
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
today and to to be able to continue her
 
03:27:03.170 --> 03:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
work which was always honored by people
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
across the aisle John McCain was a a big
 
03:27:08.150 --> 03:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
fan of hers for instance Senator Russ
 
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
Feingold as well New Hampshire's late
 
03:27:13.870 --> 03:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Warren Rudman as well she really
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
worked hard to find common ground with
 
03:27:19.309 --> 03:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
people across the Spectrum in addressing
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
what she felt was a a answer on our
 
03:27:24.050 --> 03:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
system the role of big money from all
 
03:27:26.090 --> 03:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
sorts of interests across the political
 
03:27:28.849 --> 03:27:28.859 align:start position:0%
spectrum that was dampening the voice of
 
03:27:32.090 --> 03:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
ordinary citizens in politics so I feel
 
03:27:34.130 --> 03:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
personally indebted to her for helping
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
me find my life's Mission my voice in
 
03:27:39.889 --> 03:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
civic affairs and I know that whenever
 
03:27:42.410 --> 03:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
other people encounter her story she has
 
03:27:45.110 --> 03:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
a tremendous ability to inspire them as
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
well so I hope that you will take this
 
03:27:50.090 --> 03:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
simple step of making sure that that her
 
03:27:51.950 --> 03:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
name lives on in New Hampshire and that
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
more young high school kids like me can
 
03:27:58.250 --> 03:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
can get acquainted with that inspiring
 
03:28:00.170 --> 03:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
story and can also find their way into
 
03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:02.760 align:start position:0%

campaigning in New Hampshire
 
03:31:02.090 --> 03:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
um to agree that campaign Finance was
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
was important and so this is one example
 
03:31:07.550 --> 03:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
of how she inspired both sides of of the
 
03:31:10.130 --> 03:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
aisle a more personal example to me is
 
03:31:13.010 --> 03:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
my Republican grandmother read her book
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%

03:31:33.889 --> 03:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
inspiration from both sides of the aisle
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%

03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
two minutes before the camera went on
 
03:34:27.229 --> 03:34:27.239 align:start position:0%

me
 
03:34:35.570 --> 03:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
um that there have been some wonderful
 
03:34:39.370 --> 03:34:39.380 align:start position:0%
presentations here today uh involving
 
03:34:41.710 --> 03:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
Doris haddock
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
I met her when I did my stint on the
 
03:34:47.389 --> 03:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
election law committee a wonderful
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
person and
 
03:34:52.090 --> 03:34:52.100 align:start position:0%
Dennis Brooks account was just terrific
 
03:34:55.790 --> 03:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'll begin my presentation
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and members of the committee
 
03:35:01.969 --> 03:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
Doris Haddix 3200 mile walk across the
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
country were prompted by her reading of
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
an amendment and a bill to provide the
 
03:35:09.050 --> 03:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
tobacco industry with a 50 million
 
03:35:11.809 --> 03:35:11.819 align:start position:0%
dollar tax credit
 
03:35:14.510 --> 03:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
whoa now we have always had money in
 
03:35:17.330 --> 03:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
politics she said but never like this
 
03:35:20.750 --> 03:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's what started it yeah end quote
 
03:35:23.450 --> 03:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
she was sure she was losing
 
03:35:26.090 --> 03:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
our democracy we were losing our
 
03:35:26.100 --> 03:35:27.590 align:start position:0%
our democracy we were losing our
democracy

03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
03:35:29.630 --> 03:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
though her walk was challenged by a
 
03:35:32.210 --> 03:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
multitude of physical dangers heat cold
 
03:35:35.710 --> 03:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
dry dust rain snow wild animals
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
unpredictable human behaviors
 
03:35:40.190 --> 03:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
the biggest challenge was getting in the
 
03:35:42.110 --> 03:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
way of the money machine that influences
 
03:35:44.990 --> 03:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
our elections and the few and Powerful
 
03:35:47.950 --> 03:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
who not only control those machines but
 
03:35:50.450 --> 03:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
disproportionately influence our
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
elections through their corporate packs
 
03:35:56.450 --> 03:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
super Pacs and as individuals
 
03:36:00.290 --> 03:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
akin to the current LLC loophole
 
03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
but in 2002 her bravery paid off with
 
03:36:05.450 --> 03:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan campaign Finance Reform
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
Act also named known as McCain Feingold
 
03:36:12.650 --> 03:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
signed into law by President George W
 
03:36:12.660 --> 03:36:14.809 align:start position:0%
signed into law by President George W
bush

03:36:14.809 --> 03:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
bush
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
in a challenge to the law brought in
 
03:36:19.370 --> 03:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
2003 the court largely upheld McCain
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
Feingold only to have the law largely
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
obliterated in 2010
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
by citizens united v f e c
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
Doris died 50 days after that ruling
 
03:36:34.429 --> 03:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 in the 2010 Federal
 
03:36:36.650 --> 03:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
elections the top contributors were a
 
03:36:39.490 --> 03:36:39.500 align:start position:0%
husband and wife that's seven million
 
03:36:43.250 --> 03:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
606 thousand dollars at the bottom of
 
03:36:45.889 --> 03:36:45.899 align:start position:0%
the list of 100 was another husband and
 
03:36:50.809 --> 03:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
wife at 266 900 dollars
 
03:36:54.170 --> 03:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
but by 2020 the top contributor was a
 
03:36:57.250 --> 03:36:57.260 align:start position:0%
husband and wife at 218
 
03:36:57.260 --> 03:36:58.990 align:start position:0%
husband and wife at 218
million

03:36:58.990 --> 03:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:37:03.469 --> 03:37:03.479 align:start position:0%
179 thousand dollars plus excuse me
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Perry could you
 
03:37:08.090 --> 03:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
concentrate on the bill and on granny D
 
03:37:13.969 --> 03:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.610 --> 03:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair I'm trying to form the
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
basis uh draw a contrast between uh what
 
03:37:22.190 --> 03:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
it was like when Granny D walked across
 
03:37:25.610 --> 03:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
the country to what it is now and the
 
03:37:28.330 --> 03:37:28.340 align:start position:0%
importance then
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
exemplified by the importance of it now
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
again but by 2020 the top contributor
 
03:37:41.450 --> 03:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
was a husband and wife at 218 million
 
03:37:43.389 --> 03:37:43.399 align:start position:0%
I've said that and number 100
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
contributed 3 million two hundred sixty
 
03:37:48.410 --> 03:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
eight thousand dollars
 
03:37:51.710 --> 03:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
by January 2021 total political spending
 
03:37:57.710 --> 03:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
became a 14.4 billion dollar industry
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
some contributors both corporate and
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
individual are claiming buyer's remorse
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
temporarily cutting off donations some
 
03:38:07.849 --> 03:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
are asking that their contributions be
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
returned the list of disgruntled include
 
03:38:13.490 --> 03:38:13.500 align:start position:0%

Giants
 
03:38:37.790 --> 03:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
does the 25 contribution even matter
 
03:38:37.800 --> 03:38:39.969 align:start position:0%
does the 25 contribution even matter
anymore

03:38:39.969 --> 03:38:39.979 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
there are a few people we meet in life
 
03:38:44.269 --> 03:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
who display the courage and conviction
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
of Doris granny D haddock a frail and
 
03:38:50.450 --> 03:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
unhealthy person who walked 3 200 miles
 
03:38:53.210 --> 03:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
across the country live to tell about it
 
03:38:56.090 --> 03:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
and inspired Congress to act consistent
 
03:38:59.150 --> 03:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
with mutual concerns about money and
 
03:38:59.160 --> 03:39:00.229 align:start position:0%
with mutual concerns about money and
politics

03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
politics
 
03:39:02.809 --> 03:39:02.819 align:start position:0%
she deserves her rightful place on the
 
03:39:05.330 --> 03:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
honor roll of exemplary American
 
03:39:05.340 --> 03:39:06.830 align:start position:0%
honor roll of exemplary American
citizens

03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:39:10.010 --> 03:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
I urge passage of this bill
 
03:39:13.010 --> 03:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.290 --> 03:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
are there questions for representative
 
03:39:15.300 --> 03:39:18.889 align:start position:0%
are there questions for representative
Perry

03:39:18.889 --> 03:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:22.010 --> 03:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair uh I um
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
I choose one of many thousands of people
 
03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
who got to know Granny D and um
 
03:39:35.330 --> 03:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
it doesn't and I actually I think I
 
03:39:38.269 --> 03:39:38.279 align:start position:0%
still have her uh her one of her yard
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
signs in my garage in case she ever runs
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
again because it doesn't really
 
03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't really feel like she's dead
 
03:39:45.889 --> 03:39:45.899 align:start position:0%
she's still very much of a living
 
03:39:48.769 --> 03:39:48.779 align:start position:0%
presence uh very much of living presence
 
03:39:50.690 --> 03:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
I think for everybody who got to know
 
03:39:53.210 --> 03:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
her and in fact uh when she passed in
 
03:39:56.450 --> 03:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
2010 shortly after her uh 100th birthday
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
party the executive Council chamber just
 
03:39:59.389 --> 03:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like she was going away just
 
03:40:02.690 --> 03:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
that her work was entering a different
 
03:40:04.010 --> 03:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
phase and
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not a big believer in ghosts but uh
 
03:40:08.750 --> 03:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
people who do believe gotev said that
 
03:40:10.490 --> 03:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
she's been seen in the gallery keeping
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
an eye on us back when we're still
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
reading in reptile uh and they're still
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
but uh so the gallery was still open but
 
03:40:19.370 --> 03:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and um
 
03:40:21.769 --> 03:40:21.779 align:start position:0%
and the uh other thing is even though
 
03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
her life was much longer than uh most of
 
03:40:26.210 --> 03:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
us get it was still short too short and
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
I remember at her birthday party uh she
 
03:40:32.330 --> 03:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
was introduced by a uh young woman who
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
school-aged young school age girls was
 
03:40:38.990 --> 03:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
probably uh not much older than Grande D
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
was when women got the right to vote and
 
03:40:42.170 --> 03:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
so like you know they're they're live
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
you know there was the two of them
 
03:40:43.319 --> 03:40:44.210 align:start position:0%
you know there was the two of them
together

03:40:44.210 --> 03:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
he's a council chamber so that really
 
03:40:47.809 --> 03:40:47.819 align:start position:0%
told me how little time you know how
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
short life is and how really it was not
 
03:40:51.469 --> 03:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
a long time ago that women weren't
 
03:40:53.750 --> 03:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote so um
 
03:40:55.849 --> 03:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
so she was a woman remarkable woman who
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
made a big difference she's continued to
 
03:40:59.929 --> 03:40:59.939 align:start position:0%
make a big difference and I certainly uh
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should observe her uh
 
03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
on granny D-Day and we should probably
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
remember her every day so that's some
 
03:41:08.570 --> 03:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's that's about all I have to say
 
03:41:10.250 --> 03:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
about it so I hope you'll vote for this
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
bill I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:41:14.210 --> 03:41:14.220 align:start position:0%

on relative short notice so I'll do my
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
best here
 
03:42:16.190 --> 03:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
um this uh is is a simple
 
03:42:18.849 --> 03:42:18.859 align:start position:0%
straightforward Bill uh in line with the
 
03:42:22.370 --> 03:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh proposals the committee has heard uh
 
03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
over the last half hour or so uh this
 
03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
would establish May 13th as
 
03:42:30.590 --> 03:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
um youth franchise and youth office
 
03:42:33.229 --> 03:42:33.239 align:start position:0%

50th anniversary of New Hampshire
 
03:42:37.969 --> 03:42:37.979 align:start position:0%
ratifying the 26th amendment it occurred
 
03:42:42.050 --> 03:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
on that day May 13 1971 and that of
 
03:42:44.330 --> 03:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
course uh granted the right to vote to
 
03:42:48.889 --> 03:42:48.899 align:start position:0%
folks age 18 to 21 who uh previously
 
03:42:48.899 --> 03:42:49.550 align:start position:0%
folks age 18 to 21 who uh previously
um

03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:53.150 --> 03:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
you know the the voting age was 21.
 
03:42:53.160 --> 03:42:54.229 align:start position:0%
you know the the voting age was 21.
um

03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
and some quick research uh it this uh
 
03:42:59.809 --> 03:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
was sort of a unique moment in our
 
03:43:01.070 --> 03:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
nation's history
 
03:43:03.769 --> 03:43:03.779 align:start position:0%
um Congress uh had had lowered the
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
voting age to 18
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
um in 1970 through the Voting Rights Act
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
um it was then contested I went to the
 
03:43:14.269 --> 03:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court which determined that that
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
lowered age established uh by Congress
 
03:43:20.809 --> 03:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
applied only to Federal elections a
 
03:43:24.889 --> 03:43:24.899 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment was uh drafted
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
um and in record time uh it it was
 
03:43:31.309 --> 03:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
enacted and took effect July 1 1971. so
 
03:43:34.250 --> 03:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh certainly an important event
 
03:43:36.769 --> 03:43:36.779 align:start position:0%
um in our nation uh New Hampshire of
 
03:43:38.210 --> 03:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
course had a role through its
 
03:43:38.220 --> 03:43:39.769 align:start position:0%
course had a role through its
ratification

03:43:39.769 --> 03:43:39.779 align:start position:0%
ratification
 
03:43:41.630 --> 03:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
um so I would ask the committee to
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
please consider uh pass a recommending
 
03:43:47.330 --> 03:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
passage and finally uh Madam chair and
 
03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
committee I did want to uh Circle back I
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
misspoke on HP 170 the date was 1828 as
 
03:43:58.130 --> 03:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
another uh person correctly indicated in
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
her testimony and that was why I raised
 
03:44:01.969 --> 03:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
my hand I was wanting to correct that
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry for that uh embarrassing
 
03:44:06.830 --> 03:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh mistake but with that I'm happy to
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
take questions now on 273 HP 273 if
 
03:44:12.290 --> 03:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:16.130 --> 03:44:16.140 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Conley for taking my
 
03:44:24.530 --> 03:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
question this is a one-time
 
03:44:27.889 --> 03:44:27.899 align:start position:0%
um event to commemorate anniversary did
 
03:44:29.809 --> 03:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
you reach out to the governor's office
 
03:44:32.210 --> 03:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
to for a proclamation on a one-time
 
03:44:32.220 --> 03:44:34.070 align:start position:0%
to for a proclamation on a one-time
event

03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
event
 
03:44:35.570 --> 03:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
which is the kind of the typical route
 
03:44:38.090 --> 03:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
we go with those
 
03:44:40.010 --> 03:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh rep thank you representative for the
 
03:44:41.809 --> 03:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know I I am not sure who the prime
 
03:44:47.150 --> 03:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor has reached out to uh in terms
 
03:44:48.849 --> 03:44:48.859 align:start position:0%
of uh trying to make that happen
 
03:44:52.429 --> 03:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
definitely seems like something uh
 
03:44:54.889 --> 03:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
that would be um one option another
 
03:44:56.809 --> 03:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
option is is the bill we have before us
 
03:44:56.819 --> 03:44:57.830 align:start position:0%
option is is the bill we have before us
so

03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:57.840 --> 03:44:58.729 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's not the prime sponsor so yeah
 
03:45:05.450 --> 03:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:45:10.750 --> 03:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.790 --> 03:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative Conley uh I'm wondering
 
03:45:19.250 --> 03:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
were 18 year olds required to register
 
03:45:22.250 --> 03:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
for the selective service act under the
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
selective service act for the draft at
 
03:45:27.290 --> 03:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
uh at that age
 
03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schmidt I can answer
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
03:45:33.650 --> 03:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much Madam chair
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
because uh uh I know at the time it was
 
03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out that uh that uh the young
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
people young men anyway at that age uh
 
03:45:46.610 --> 03:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
could be called into service and killed
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the service of their country but they
 
03:45:51.650 --> 03:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
couldn't vote so seemed like a good idea
 
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
to me to be allowing them to to vote
 
03:45:58.670 --> 03:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate your information
 
03:46:00.650 --> 03:46:00.660 align:start position:0%

03:49:22.490 --> 03:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
when I saw this string of bills
 
03:49:27.229 --> 03:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
I had to look up Mr wentwill and uh so I
 
03:49:29.090 --> 03:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
just will fill in the Gap a bit here
 
03:49:31.370 --> 03:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
while you're waiting for the sponsor
 
03:49:34.370 --> 03:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
I've forgotten which town Mr wetwell was
 
03:49:38.690 --> 03:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
from he was of mixed race in the 1700s
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
he served in the Revolutionary War
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and then he became what they think is
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
probably the first black elected
 
03:49:49.080 --> 03:49:50.410 align:start position:0%
probably the first black elected
official

03:49:50.410 --> 03:49:50.420 align:start position:0%
official
 
03:49:53.870 --> 03:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
certainly in New Hampshire possibly even
 
03:49:55.370 --> 03:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
03:49:58.250 --> 03:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that your sponsor gets on
 
03:50:01.370 --> 03:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
and can fill in those gaps
 
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
um but it is yet another interesting
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
story from New Hampshire's history I'm
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
so glad we're so full of Firsts here and
 
03:50:11.389 --> 03:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
that's about all I have to say here so I
 
03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
will let you wait for the sponsor to
 
03:50:21.490 --> 03:50:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.040 --> 03:50:33.290 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:50:33.290 --> 03:50:33.300 align:start position:0%

fragile personal legal documents I can
 
03:51:24.530 --> 03:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
say that the one thing you should take
 
03:51:26.510 --> 03:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
away from his life is his astonishing
 
03:51:28.849 --> 03:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
dedication to public service in the

personally and publicly invited by the

03:51:51.710 --> 03:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
his skin yet his son Wentworth grandson

included the trade of sugar and slaves
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
Wentworth cheswell became what George
 
03:52:07.790 --> 03:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
Mason University determined to be the
 
03:52:09.769 --> 03:52:09.779 align:start position:0%

but that's just the start of Wentworth
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
cheswell's story like Paul Revere he
 
03:52:19.490 --> 03:52:19.500 align:start position:0%

03:52:38.570 --> 03:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
Wentworth cheswell served as a constable

school teacher inaugural School member
 
03:52:43.610 --> 03:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
selectman Town moderator assessor
 
03:52:46.130 --> 03:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
justice of the peace for the county he
 
03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
was even the coroner
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
in fact he served every year of his
 
03:52:51.889 --> 03:52:51.899 align:start position:0%
adult life but one
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
and there are some who note that that
 
03:52:56.330 --> 03:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
last that lost year of service uh
 
03:52:59.150 --> 03:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
conspicuously coincides with the year of
 
03:53:01.610 --> 03:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
the ratification of the U.S Constitution
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
so I like to believe he's lent some
 
03:53:05.210 --> 03:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
effort to that cause
 
03:53:07.370 --> 03:53:07.380 align:start position:0%

of New Hampshire history
 
03:53:16.250 --> 03:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
and cheswell was not only in early New
 
03:53:18.050 --> 03:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire archaeologist he's arguably
 
03:53:20.650 --> 03:53:20.660 align:start position:0%
one of the earliest in the nation
 
03:53:23.330 --> 03:53:23.340 align:start position:0%

03:56:26.450 --> 03:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:38.929 --> 03:56:38.939 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again members of the
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee thank you madam chair for the
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on a second bill
 
03:56:45.889 --> 03:56:45.899 align:start position:0%
and if I may um in order to save your
 
03:56:48.410 --> 03:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
time I wish to testify in support of
 
03:56:52.010 --> 03:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
both this HP 283 and rather than
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
appearing again
 
03:56:55.309 --> 03:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
um a little bit later also in support of
 
03:57:00.590 --> 03:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
HP 84 and 155 but just briefly if I may
 
03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
again a personal perspective
 
03:57:05.150 --> 03:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
um as as noted previously I grew up in
 
03:57:07.550 --> 03:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and proud to trace my
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
family lineage back 12 generations to
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
the first generation of Europeans who
 
03:57:15.170 --> 03:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
arrived in Portsmouth Harbor and made
 
03:57:16.490 --> 03:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
their home in the New Hampshire Seacoast
 
03:57:20.210 --> 03:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
not far from Wentworth she as well and I
 
03:57:22.550 --> 03:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
grew up I'm proud of that European
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
Heritage in totally unaware of our more
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
diverse Heritage as a state I'm totally
 
03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
unaware of the fact that several hundred
 
03:57:33.229 --> 03:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
or even a few thousand people of African
 
03:57:34.910 --> 03:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
descent were enslaved in New Hampshire
 
03:57:38.150 --> 03:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
up until the 1840s
 
03:57:39.769 --> 03:57:39.779 align:start position:0%
um which speaks to
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
um the next bill up um to honor Ona
 
03:57:45.050 --> 03:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
judge who escaped enslavement from the
 
03:57:47.210 --> 03:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
Washington presidential household in
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia and settled in New
 
03:57:50.150 --> 03:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where she lived for decades
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
also in the Seacoast and so um for me
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
just discovering in recent times this
 
03:57:58.130 --> 03:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
history the inspiring story of Wentworth
 
03:58:01.250 --> 03:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
cheswell also of own a judge and the
 
03:58:03.469 --> 03:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
many others again hundreds of people who
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
were at one point enslaved in New
 
03:58:06.650 --> 03:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and thousands of people of
 
03:58:09.769 --> 03:58:09.779 align:start position:0%
African descent as well as of course the
 
03:58:11.929 --> 03:58:11.939 align:start position:0%
many thousands of indigenous people who
 
03:58:15.410 --> 03:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
occupied these lands before my ancestors
 
03:58:17.689 --> 03:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
arrived it has been expanding my Horizon
 
03:58:22.130 --> 03:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
and frankly has been inspiring to me and
 
03:58:24.429 --> 03:58:24.439 align:start position:0%
is Meaningful to my family as well
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
although I traced back 12 generations of
 
03:58:30.530 --> 03:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
European Heritage I'm fortunate to be
 
03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
the dad of three young children who are
 
03:58:35.570 --> 03:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
also of African descent my wife
 
03:58:38.689 --> 03:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
emigrated to the U.S from South Africa
 
03:58:42.290 --> 03:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
we met in graduate school abroad and so
 
03:58:45.469 --> 03:58:45.479 align:start position:0%
as I think of wanting my kids to make
 
03:58:47.450 --> 03:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire their home to make a
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
future here we know that the out
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
migration of young people is a challenge
 
03:58:52.849 --> 03:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
it's one that my business faces where
 
03:58:54.889 --> 03:58:54.899 align:start position:0%
we're always struggling to hire the
 
03:58:57.410 --> 03:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
talent we need to work in the trades in
 
03:59:00.110 --> 03:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
particular in clean energy I believe
 
03:59:01.969 --> 03:59:01.979 align:start position:0%
that telling more of New Hampshire's
 
03:59:04.189 --> 03:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
authentic history that just hasn't been
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
told so far by honoring characters like
 
03:59:09.830 --> 03:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
Wentworth cheswell a remarkable
 
03:59:11.809 --> 03:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
achievement that New Hampshire can claim
 
03:59:13.729 --> 03:59:13.739 align:start position:0%
the first elected official of African
 
03:59:16.490 --> 03:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
descent and also the remarkable story of
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
Ona judge as I know you'll consider in a
 
03:59:20.809 --> 03:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
few more minutes who again made a life
 
03:59:23.210 --> 03:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
for herself after escaping enslavement
 
03:59:25.309 --> 03:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
as a young woman in the presidential
 
03:59:27.710 --> 03:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
House in Philadelphia I think these
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
kinds of stories can be exciting can
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
fire the imaginations of all our
 
03:59:35.570 --> 03:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
children personally my my three children
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
who I hope will see a home for
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
themselves helps and see people who can
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
be their role models and inspiration to
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
them who share their skin complexion but
 
03:59:46.729 --> 03:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
also kids like me who just grow up
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
unawares but are excited to get to know
 
03:59:52.429 --> 03:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
more of the world in our own history so
 
03:59:55.490 --> 03:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
I think again as a proud granted Stater
 
03:59:57.170 --> 03:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
I'm so grateful that this committee is
 
03:59:59.330 --> 03:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
is spending time and that the lead
 
04:00:00.889 --> 04:00:00.899 align:start position:0%
sponsors have introduced this
 
04:00:03.650 --> 04:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
legislation these multiple bills and I
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
think this is a very exciting
 
04:00:07.969 --> 04:00:07.979 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our state to tell a a
 
04:00:10.729 --> 04:00:10.739 align:start position:0%
fuller history and again show that we
 
04:00:13.010 --> 04:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
are indeed welcoming of all those who
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
have made us who we are and those who
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
will make us who we will become in the
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
years ahead so thanks again and I urge
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
you to support this bill as well as HP
 
04:00:26.510 --> 04:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
84 and HP 155 thank you
 
04:00:29.950 --> 04:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:32.210 --> 04:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:00:34.090 --> 04:00:34.100 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:40.610 --> 04:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I would just like
 
04:00:42.410 --> 04:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
to keep my comment brief my name is
 
04:00:44.450 --> 04:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
Tristan McLean I am speaking on behalf
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
of myself as a member of the public I
 
04:00:48.349 --> 04:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
currently reside in Plymouth New
 
04:00:48.359 --> 04:00:49.309 align:start position:0%
currently reside in Plymouth New
Hampshire

04:00:49.309 --> 04:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:00:52.010 --> 04:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
I think and
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
the steps involved and remedying and
 
04:00:59.150 --> 04:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
reconciling with our country's past it's
 
04:01:02.090 --> 04:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
only just that we recognize everyone
 
04:01:05.630 --> 04:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
despite what the past has done for Mr
 
04:01:05.640 --> 04:01:07.849 align:start position:0%
despite what the past has done for Mr
Wentworth

04:01:07.849 --> 04:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
Wentworth
 
04:01:07.859 --> 04:01:08.630 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
it would be nice to
 
04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
kind of get to a better step of no
 
04:01:16.250 --> 04:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
longer whitewashing history and I think
 
04:01:18.050 --> 04:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
the Merit of wentworth's character
 
04:01:19.729 --> 04:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
speaks much of our values that are much
 
04:01:22.130 --> 04:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
in line with what we aspire to have in
 
04:01:23.450 --> 04:01:23.460 align:start position:0%

04:03:19.560 --> 04:03:21.849 align:start position:0%
are our country's history is much more
uh

04:03:21.849 --> 04:03:21.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:26.450 --> 04:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
varied and interesting than what I was
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
taught in elementary school I grew up in
 
04:03:31.610 --> 04:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
New York I was taught that I was from
 
04:03:33.889 --> 04:03:33.899 align:start position:0%
the north and I had nothing to do with
 
04:03:35.809 --> 04:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
any of the problems that have to do with
 
04:03:37.490 --> 04:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
slavery or race
 
04:03:40.729 --> 04:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't until when I was an adult
 
04:03:43.250 --> 04:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
and I started doing genealogical
 
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
research that I realized that my very
 
04:03:49.450 --> 04:03:49.460 align:start position:0%
own Quaker ancestors of all people had
 
04:03:49.460 --> 04:03:51.110 align:start position:0%
own Quaker ancestors of all people had
enslaved

04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
enslaved
 
04:03:53.929 --> 04:03:53.939 align:start position:0%
workers and
 
04:03:57.290 --> 04:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
I was horrified and I think it's really
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
important for us to recognize
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
all of the aspects of our history as as
 
04:04:05.330 --> 04:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
the young gentleman who testified just
 
04:04:06.849 --> 04:04:06.859 align:start position:0%
before me said
 
04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
04:04:09.180 --> 04:04:09.830 align:start position:0%
in this case
um

04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
this was the only enslaved person who
 
04:04:15.010 --> 04:04:15.020 align:start position:0%
escaped from
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
the ownership of the Washington family
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
she lived with them both in Virginia and
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
in Philadelphia and I believe it was
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
from Philadelphia that she escaped and
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
came North to Portsmouth and she lived
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth and in Greenfield and and
 
04:04:35.410 --> 04:04:35.420 align:start position:0%
made the rest of her life there
 
04:04:40.929 --> 04:04:40.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
Washington's made
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
pretty significant efforts to have her
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
return to them
 
04:04:52.189 --> 04:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to know that and
 
04:04:55.729 --> 04:04:55.739 align:start position:0%
understand that and celebrate the life
 
04:04:58.490 --> 04:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
that she made for herself and understand
 
04:05:01.729 --> 04:05:01.739 align:start position:0%
the lives of all those living in
 
04:05:05.330 --> 04:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
colonial times but um you know I'm I'm
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
well aware that here in in Walpole there
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
were slaves
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
who were brought from Africa and then
 
04:05:14.929 --> 04:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
brought to Walpole and and lived the
 
04:05:18.530 --> 04:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives here and we need to
 
04:05:20.990 --> 04:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
be telling their stories as well as the
 
04:05:23.929 --> 04:05:23.939 align:start position:0%
stories that most of us who are white
 
04:05:25.450 --> 04:05:25.460 align:start position:0%
grew up with
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
so with that I am going to ask that you
 
04:05:29.760 --> 04:05:31.849 align:start position:0%
so with that I am going to ask that you
procla

04:05:31.849 --> 04:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
procla
 
04:05:31.859 --> 04:05:33.849 align:start position:0%
procla
um

04:05:33.849 --> 04:05:33.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:37.969 --> 04:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
uh that that house bill 84 biot to pass
 
04:05:42.410 --> 04:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I will pass on to others who perhaps
 
04:05:45.170 --> 04:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
know more about it the story than I do
 
04:05:47.389 --> 04:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
but it's a fascinating story I have read
 
04:05:49.490 --> 04:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
the book but I didn't have time to look
 
04:05:52.189 --> 04:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
it out and review it for today so thank
 
04:05:54.530 --> 04:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
you very much for the Indulgence
 
04:05:58.070 --> 04:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much who else is
 
04:06:00.130 --> 04:06:00.140 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
04:06:02.809 --> 04:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt representative
 
04:06:05.570 --> 04:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
Weber will you take a question certainly
 
04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the copy that I believe
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
the Portsmouth library has in its rare
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
books collection telling the story of
 
04:06:14.210 --> 04:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
only judge
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
um at her first cape
 
04:06:18.170 --> 04:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
and the first fight
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
to maintain her Freedom uh when when the
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
Washington family was making
 
04:06:27.309 --> 04:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
considerable efforts to retrieve her and
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
know that there is is a book published
 
04:06:36.290 --> 04:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
that I read with great interest some
 
04:06:39.410 --> 04:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
time back and if only I still retained
 
04:06:41.150 --> 04:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
as many brain cells as you do
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I would have been
 
04:06:44.809 --> 04:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
able to address the issue better but I
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the knowledge
 
04:06:50.330 --> 04:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
I doubt I have more than you do
 
04:06:57.769 --> 04:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.610 --> 04:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
we can't find anyone else who signed up
 
04:07:06.769 --> 04:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill so if there is is
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
someone who wishes to speech please
 
04:07:19.250 --> 04:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:51.410 --> 04:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative Delorenzo you need to
 
04:07:55.330 --> 04:07:55.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:58.849 --> 04:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
here we go thank you madam chair
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
um you know I've read I read the story
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
of Oni judge and I was really impressed
 
04:08:06.650 --> 04:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a local story it's a
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
good story it's a story about a woman
 
04:08:12.889 --> 04:08:12.899 align:start position:0%
who managed to get on a boat from um
 
04:08:15.650 --> 04:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
Britannia and come up to Portsmouth and
 
04:08:17.809 --> 04:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
made a life first for herself and her
 
04:08:17.819 --> 04:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
made a life first for herself and her
family

04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's only fitting that we
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
honor her memory her perseverance
 
04:08:27.170 --> 04:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
and one of the nice things about the
 
04:08:31.010 --> 04:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
bill is that it asks to name the new
 
04:08:34.849 --> 04:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
terminal at peace after owner judge and
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
to me that's slightly ironic uh that
 
04:08:39.530 --> 04:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
first of all this bill is being heard on
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
Washington's birthday and miss judge
 
04:08:45.010 --> 04:08:45.020 align:start position:0%
escaped front of Washington and secondly
 
04:08:48.110 --> 04:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's kind of ironic too that we want to
 
04:08:51.889 --> 04:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
name an airport terminal after misjudged
 
04:08:54.050 --> 04:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
because she was definitely a traveler
 
04:08:56.570 --> 04:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
she traveled by herself from Portsmouth
 
04:08:58.490 --> 04:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
from I mean sorry from Virginia to
 
04:09:00.710 --> 04:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and now we want to put her
 
04:09:02.929 --> 04:09:02.939 align:start position:0%
name on an air terminal to show her
 
04:09:07.010 --> 04:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
ability to not fly but to manage to get
 
04:09:08.689 --> 04:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
from one place to the other thank you
 
04:09:10.130 --> 04:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%

04:09:29.090 --> 04:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
information with us about the part that
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
04:09:30.600 --> 04:09:31.370 align:start position:0%
has to do with
um

04:09:31.370 --> 04:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:34.450 --> 04:09:34.460 align:start position:0%
naming the Air Terminal

Authority would would pay the needs to
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
approve the sign and pay for the cost of
 
04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
the sign and I'm just wondering if if
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
you spoke with people from your terminal
 
04:09:54.720 --> 04:09:56.150 align:start position:0%

so
 
04:10:51.530 --> 04:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.370 --> 04:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Thomas I mute yourself
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%

04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
that case asthma elleny

thank you so much Madam chair and
 
04:11:48.170 --> 04:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:11:48.180 --> 04:11:49.969 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
usmani

04:11:49.969 --> 04:11:49.979 align:start position:0%
usmani
 
04:11:52.130 --> 04:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to say my strong
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
support of such a bill I'm a mother of
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh eight boys
 
04:12:00.889 --> 04:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
um for uh black boys and I think it's
 
04:12:04.010 --> 04:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
really important that our black children
 
04:12:08.150 --> 04:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
our black community members see their
 
04:12:12.309 --> 04:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
Heroes Our Heroes our state Heroes
 
04:12:14.809 --> 04:12:14.819 align:start position:0%
recognize the way many others are
 
04:12:18.250 --> 04:12:18.260 align:start position:0%
because it it really does affect
 
04:12:21.410 --> 04:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
children it affects people when they
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't see people like themselves
 
04:12:25.729 --> 04:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
recognized and so I think this is one
 
04:12:29.689 --> 04:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
way New Hampshire can show it's going to
 
04:12:32.929 --> 04:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
do good by its community and so I highly
 
04:12:32.939 --> 04:12:34.429 align:start position:0%
do good by its community and so I highly
recommend

04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
04:12:39.769 --> 04:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.450 --> 04:12:41.460 align:start position:0%

04:13:39.060 --> 04:13:47.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:13:47.650 --> 04:13:47.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
all right Mr weeks
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Dan weeks again from Nashua
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
I'm just a final point of clarification
 
04:13:57.469 --> 04:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
I appreciated the opportunity a few
 
04:14:00.769 --> 04:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
minutes ago to to testify and support
 
04:14:02.450 --> 04:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize there's some young
 
04:14:04.010 --> 04:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
kids in the background
 
04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
um simply to point out
 
04:14:08.809 --> 04:14:08.819 align:start position:0%
um that miss judge actually went by the
 
04:14:12.530 --> 04:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
name Ona judge Staines which was her
 
04:14:15.650 --> 04:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
last name others have alluded to the
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
historical book completed by a professor
 
04:14:20.050 --> 04:14:20.060 align:start position:0%
of History
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
titled never caught which provides a
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
detailed account of her life and she did
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
after settling in Portsmouth after
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
making her Escape Mary the gentleman
 
04:14:31.610 --> 04:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
whose last name was stains and took his
 
04:14:35.809 --> 04:14:35.819 align:start position:0%
name in the Oni nickname is one that she
 
04:14:37.969 --> 04:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
was given as a diminutive when she was
 
04:14:40.910 --> 04:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
enslaved but not one that she ever chose
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
to use herself so I don't know whether
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
this should be referred to the prime
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Cushing or if the
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee would consider such an
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
amendment but the name by which
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
I apologize she knew herself was again
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
Ona judge Staines
 
04:14:59.210 --> 04:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
s-t-a-i-n-e-s and I can recommend that
 
04:15:01.969 --> 04:15:01.979 align:start position:0%
title as well as the work that the black
 
04:15:03.650 --> 04:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
Heritage Trail of New Hampshire has done
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not a member but I'm just an
 
04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
interested citizen who follows their
 
04:15:11.330 --> 04:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
work so I do encourage the committee to
 
04:15:14.570 --> 04:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
consider certainly to pass the bill I
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
hope but to do so I'm using the name
 
04:15:19.309 --> 04:15:19.319 align:start position:0%

04:15:21.050 --> 04:15:21.060 align:start position:0%

04:15:21.060 --> 04:15:22.250 align:start position:0%
you so much and I do apologize for the

thank you very much for that information
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%

that oh she didn't like to use Ona
 
04:15:44.939 --> 04:15:46.180 align:start position:0%

04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:16:10.450 --> 04:16:10.460 align:start position:0%
see none
 
04:16:12.530 --> 04:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
close the hearing
 
04:16:15.910 --> 04:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
and open the hearing on House Bill 155
 
04:16:49.450 --> 04:16:49.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:57.410 --> 04:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.290 --> 04:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.330 --> 04:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
appear to have he appears to have his
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
hand raised Madam chair so maybe he's
 
04:17:13.269 --> 04:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
having a technical problem there I am
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you please uh
 
04:17:18.910 --> 04:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
signing on to speak to an earlier Bill
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm president Timothy Horrigan I
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
represent uh African County District Six
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
the towns of Durham and Madbury and it's
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
actually not coincidental that I've
 
04:17:32.809 --> 04:17:32.819 align:start position:0%
represented Durham um I
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
I took on this issue um I picked up the
 
04:17:38.570 --> 04:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
Baton from former representative Wayne
 
04:17:40.250 --> 04:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
Burton who's still a town counselor and
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
then he interned uh spearheaded an
 
04:17:45.050 --> 04:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
effort to have an official indigenous
 
04:17:47.210 --> 04:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
people's day uh celebration in Durham
 
04:17:49.070 --> 04:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
and we've also uh
 
04:17:50.809 --> 04:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
worshiper School District was also one
 
04:17:51.769 --> 04:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
of the first school districts to
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
officially uh celebrate indigenous
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
people stay on October on the Monday in
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
October which is uh known by others as
 
04:18:02.050 --> 04:18:02.060 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day so that's uh
 
04:18:04.849 --> 04:18:04.859 align:start position:0%
that's how I how I came to be working on
 
04:18:08.150 --> 04:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
this issue um it's a HP one to 55 it's a
 
04:18:09.769 --> 04:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
very simple build even though there's a
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
lot of complicated issues behind it it's
 
04:18:15.189 --> 04:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
simply changes the name of the existing
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
mid-october holiday
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
um held on the second Monday in October
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
from Columbus Day
 
04:18:23.889 --> 04:18:23.899 align:start position:0%
prodigious peoples today
 
04:18:25.849 --> 04:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
this Monday has been celebrated
 
04:18:28.670 --> 04:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
unofficially and even officially as as
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
in Durham and the oysterville school
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
district as indigenous people say for
 
04:18:33.830 --> 04:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
many years in fact it's become a more
 
04:18:33.840 --> 04:18:35.269 align:start position:0%
many years in fact it's become a more
significant

04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:18:37.490 --> 04:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
celebration then Columbus Day and then
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
we'll be continuing to be highlighted
 
04:18:40.610 --> 04:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
the yearly calendar regardless of what
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
happens to HB 155 since um you know we
 
04:18:46.670 --> 04:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
don't need nobody needs official uh
 
04:18:48.530 --> 04:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
permission to you know celebrate a
 
04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
holiday it's just uh you know
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm speaking just for myself as a
 
04:18:55.070 --> 04:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor although I've I've good
 
04:18:56.330 --> 04:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
reason to believe I'm far from alone
 
04:18:57.889 --> 04:18:57.899 align:start position:0%
I've heard this from other supporters of
 
04:19:00.170 --> 04:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
bills Mike Michael here
 
04:19:02.269 --> 04:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
is a rename the official mid-october
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
holiday period I wanted to continue
 
04:19:06.290 --> 04:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
having an official holiday in the second
 
04:19:08.269 --> 04:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
Monday in October but uh I think it
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
should be officially named after the
 
04:19:13.010 --> 04:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
native peoples of North America and I
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
very specifically wanted to not be named
 
04:19:17.809 --> 04:19:17.819 align:start position:0%
after Christopher Columbus
 
04:19:20.330 --> 04:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
um that's that's the goal um
 
04:19:21.769 --> 04:19:21.779 align:start position:0%
I know there's an amendment floating
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
around by a member who hasn't spoken yet
 
04:19:25.490 --> 04:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
and isn't even a member of the committee
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
who had some other day in mind um
 
04:19:29.389 --> 04:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
actually if you want to have an
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
observation like granny D-Day or the
 
04:19:32.929 --> 04:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
other days that I proposed earlier that
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
I actually don't object to that but I
 
04:19:36.590 --> 04:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
don't want official holiday that's the
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
goal this bill is to have a mid-october
 
04:19:40.429 --> 04:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
holiday on the second Monday in October
 
04:19:43.849 --> 04:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
be in business people's day so that's
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
anyway Christopher Columbus as we all
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
learned in grade school is a man who
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
supposedly discovered American 1492.
 
04:19:52.490 --> 04:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
and occurs to millions of people who are
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
already living in the Americas in 1492
 
04:19:56.030 --> 04:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
were already well aware that America
 
04:19:58.729 --> 04:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
existed they knew they were there
 
04:20:00.889 --> 04:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
Columbus himself um
 
04:20:02.809 --> 04:20:02.819 align:start position:0%
get a lot of theories about uh
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
navigation and geography of the Earth
 
04:20:07.370 --> 04:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
but he he had some of these assumptions
 
04:20:08.809 --> 04:20:08.819 align:start position:0%
were wrong but he had a very accurate
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
idea of how wide the Atlantic Ocean was
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
some he found land actually exactly
 
04:20:14.450 --> 04:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
where he thought he was going to find it
 
04:20:14.460 --> 04:20:15.349 align:start position:0%
where he thought he was going to find it
um

04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:18.530 --> 04:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
and uh and one of the reasons where he
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
got though he was certainly not and he
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
was certainly not the uh first European
 
04:20:24.290 --> 04:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
to travel to North America named the
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
best known example and actually we have
 
04:20:28.130 --> 04:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
an observation with an observation many
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
years of Leif Erickson day but that's uh
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
but they need the best exams
 
04:20:34.670 --> 04:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
Scandinavians established a very well
 
04:20:36.410 --> 04:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
documented colony in Greenland would
 
04:20:38.330 --> 04:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
survive for 500 years beginning in the
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
mid-19 900s um it's uh it is relatively
 
04:20:44.150 --> 04:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
peacefully not long before Columbus's
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
time when The Descendants original
 
04:20:47.809 --> 04:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
colonists migrated back to Scandinavia
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
in the mid 1400s and actually Greenland
 
04:20:52.010 --> 04:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
is still part of continuing with Denmark
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
but then they were they were not the so
 
04:20:55.729 --> 04:20:55.739 align:start position:0%
those Scandinavians were not the only
 
04:20:57.950 --> 04:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
Europeans who traveled to North America
 
04:21:01.250 --> 04:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
there's there's other cases and um
 
04:21:03.050 --> 04:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day didn't become an official
 
04:21:05.689 --> 04:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
federal holiday until 1971.
 
04:21:05.699 --> 04:21:06.469 align:start position:0%
federal holiday until 1971.
um

04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:09.110 --> 04:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
I think even in 1971 the main reason for
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
it was uh
 
04:21:13.130 --> 04:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
as a that was shortly after the when we
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
were when we just landed on the moon it
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
was mostly holiday to celebrate
 
04:21:20.450 --> 04:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
exploration in general and then uh
 
04:21:22.670 --> 04:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
and uh the Columbus anyway and since
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
then uh historians have gained a clear
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of Columbus and it's now
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
cleared his journeys for one of the
 
04:21:30.530 --> 04:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
great tragedies in human history even
 
04:21:30.540 --> 04:21:31.610 align:start position:0%
great tragedies in human history even
though

04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
though
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
even though it's probably inevitable
 
04:21:34.670 --> 04:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
that uh you know
 
04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
the the Americas and the rest of the
 
04:21:39.229 --> 04:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
world lived like uh coming to closer
 
04:21:40.910 --> 04:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
contact maybe in the past but it was it
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
was just a tragic history he uh
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
brilliant man in many ways but he was
 
04:21:47.870 --> 04:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
also like did a lot of very very bad
 
04:21:49.490 --> 04:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
things um
 
04:21:51.710 --> 04:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
and then also Columbus never visited
 
04:21:52.969 --> 04:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
what is now known as the United States
 
04:21:54.830 --> 04:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
of America the closest he came to United
 
04:21:57.769 --> 04:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
States was the Bahamas in Cuba
 
04:21:59.630 --> 04:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
and for what it was he was not really
 
04:21:59.640 --> 04:22:00.710 align:start position:0%
and for what it was he was not really
Italian

04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
Italian
 
04:22:02.689 --> 04:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
um he was from the Republic of Genoa
 
04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
which is a small country that doesn't
 
04:22:05.870 --> 04:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
exist anymore his territory has been
 
04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
divided between France and Italy I mean
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
his native tongue was ligurian which is
 
04:22:11.750 --> 04:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
more closely related to French and
 
04:22:13.610 --> 04:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
Italian Sailors is a very young man and
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
he spent his adult life first in
 
04:22:17.929 --> 04:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
Portugal and later in Spain although in
 
04:22:19.550 --> 04:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
all fairness I should add that the
 
04:22:20.929 --> 04:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
Spanish to
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
the Spanish do we actually recognize do
 
04:22:25.610 --> 04:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
also consider one of their own so you
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
know there's I don't mean any
 
04:22:29.809 --> 04:22:29.819 align:start position:0%
don't mean any disrespect for Italian
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
Americans I in fact made a point of
 
04:22:35.150 --> 04:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
wearing an Italian tie today but um I
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
think uh I think we should have uh I
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
think we should have an indigenous
 
04:22:41.090 --> 04:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
people's Day holiday on that same day to
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
honor um the indigenous peoples the
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
Americas who uh were here for thousands
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
of years before my European ancestors um
 
04:22:53.330 --> 04:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
like my like like uh Mr like uh Mr wheat
 
04:22:54.889 --> 04:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
she spoke earlier I have many ancestors
 
04:22:56.450 --> 04:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
you go back way back to the first
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
European student colonize the United
 
04:23:01.729 --> 04:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
States uh but uh you know we should have
 
04:23:03.889 --> 04:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the holiday that I
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
think that's the American holiday that I
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
think we should have indigenous people's
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
day so that's uh
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's basically uh that's
 
04:23:11.279 --> 04:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's basically uh that's
basically

04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:23:14.570 --> 04:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
why I think this bill should be
 
04:23:16.370 --> 04:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
passionately be happy to take any
 
04:23:16.380 --> 04:23:19.550 align:start position:0%
passionately be happy to take any
questions

04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:22.510 --> 04:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative O'Brien
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
ah thank you uh and thank you
 
04:23:27.950 --> 04:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
we heard this uh very same build
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
facsimile like in the uh automatic
 
04:23:36.110 --> 04:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
chamber in Nashville and I spoke on it
 
04:23:39.410 --> 04:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
at the time uh your facts are correct
 
04:23:43.130 --> 04:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
but then again uh the thing is
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
this is not just uh indigenous people
 
04:23:49.370 --> 04:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
although I do support that they should
 
04:23:51.229 --> 04:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
have their own day
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
is that this day has been adopted by the
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
Italian Community I grew up in Boston
 
04:24:00.769 --> 04:24:00.779 align:start position:0%
even though I grew up in an Irish
 
04:24:03.290 --> 04:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
neighborhood I recommend I recognize
 
04:24:06.349 --> 04:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
that my Italian friends have adopted
 
04:24:08.929 --> 04:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
Christopher Columbus to be one of their
 
04:24:12.010 --> 04:24:12.020 align:start position:0%
own now I am all in favor of having
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
indigenous people stay in keeping
 
04:24:18.290 --> 04:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day I can't and I want you to
 
04:24:21.710 --> 04:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
try to convince me why should I throw my
 
04:24:24.530 --> 04:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
Italian friends under the bus and get
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
rid of them completely I do know the
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
history of the United States that there
 
04:24:33.050 --> 04:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
was situations where Italian immigrants
 
04:24:36.530 --> 04:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
were murdered in these United States and
 
04:24:38.990 --> 04:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
that the federal government did name
 
04:24:41.929 --> 04:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day for that one year in
 
04:24:43.729 --> 04:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
recognition to those people who were
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
murdered in that particular tragic
 
04:24:49.490 --> 04:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
incident so it does have a tie to one
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
particular another race so why should we
 
04:24:56.450 --> 04:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
throw that race out to make it better
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
for another race when we could probably
 
04:25:01.490 --> 04:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
be more inclusive and give the
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
indigenous people their own very special
 
04:25:03.600 --> 04:25:05.450 align:start position:0%
indigenous people their own very special
day

04:25:05.450 --> 04:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:25:05.460 --> 04:25:06.590 align:start position:0%
day
um

04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
I mean this has been I'm uh I'm mostly
 
04:25:11.929 --> 04:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
Irish um as you can tell by my name
 
04:25:14.150 --> 04:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
which is uh
 
04:25:16.189 --> 04:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
not quite as Irish as Michael O'Brien
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
but pretty close so you and we'll see
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
what Irish ancestry on my father's side
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
as you guessed from my name um
 
04:25:25.969 --> 04:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
and we not sure how to answer
 
04:25:27.290 --> 04:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to show the Italian
 
04:25:28.969 --> 04:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
Americans under the bus and I'm aware of
 
04:25:31.370 --> 04:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of the the history I will say uh
 
04:25:34.490 --> 04:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
our our national our ethnic holiday is
 
04:25:36.769 --> 04:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
St Patrick's Day which um
 
04:25:39.530 --> 04:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's about everybody people everybody
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
is Irish for that one day so that's
 
04:25:44.090 --> 04:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
become you know a major celebration on
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
the calendar and we we do that without
 
04:25:47.389 --> 04:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
any official permission whatsoever
 
04:25:50.030 --> 04:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
except in uh except in Suffolk County
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
where you grew up representative Brian
 
04:25:54.170 --> 04:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
where it is uh it is evacuation day but
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
every you know uh
 
04:25:58.130 --> 04:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
and of course you know the indigenous
 
04:25:59.809 --> 04:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
people say it's grown up without you
 
04:26:01.610 --> 04:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
know without the name of the holiday
 
04:26:03.290 --> 04:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
without the uh
 
04:26:05.030 --> 04:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
without actually official recognition
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
but I think it should have official
 
04:26:08.809 --> 04:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
recognition I do certainly I know from
 
04:26:11.450 --> 04:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
my own experiences Irish American um you
 
04:26:14.210 --> 04:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
know we can celebrate our we celebrate
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
our uh our heritage on St Patrick's day
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
without any official permission
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so I don't know really much
 
04:26:21.290 --> 04:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
of a better answer than that since I'm
 
04:26:22.130 --> 04:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
not trying to throw the Italian
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
Americans under the bus and uh
 
04:26:29.330 --> 04:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
and actually Columbus's uh actually in
 
04:26:31.309 --> 04:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
the Spanish-speaking world like uh
 
04:26:33.170 --> 04:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
that's also become sort of a holiday of
 
04:26:34.670 --> 04:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
the Spanish-speaking world because uh
 
04:26:37.610 --> 04:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
Columbus uh is Columbus was it was
 
04:26:39.290 --> 04:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
Spanish and in fact you know journey to
 
04:26:41.689 --> 04:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
North America like
 
04:26:43.610 --> 04:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
sort of on the payroll of the king and
 
04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
queen of Spain so I'm not not trying to
 
04:26:47.689 --> 04:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
throw anybody in the bus I'm just uh
 
04:26:50.450 --> 04:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
just I'm just uh trying to uh recognize
 
04:26:52.010 --> 04:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples I'm not trying to
 
04:26:54.649 --> 04:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
downgrade anybody anybody else so
 
04:26:54.659 --> 04:26:57.729 align:start position:0%

04:27:12.769 --> 04:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
other than maybe that one exception is
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
handled by private observance and it's
 
04:27:17.090 --> 04:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
very successful in that
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
so and uh
 
04:27:21.050 --> 04:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
I guess and there's concern about
 
04:27:23.809 --> 04:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day so to keep things uh
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
kind of fair for everybody would you be
 
04:27:27.710 --> 04:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
supportive of removing or eliminating
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
official recognition of all such days
 
04:27:32.689 --> 04:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
and leave it to the people who are
 
04:27:35.330 --> 04:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
interested in private organizations to
 
04:27:37.370 --> 04:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
take that on as it's done for Saint
 
04:27:39.340 --> 04:27:39.350 align:start position:0%
Patrick's Day
 
04:27:39.350 --> 04:27:39.649 align:start position:0%
Patrick's Day
[Music]

04:27:39.649 --> 04:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:39.659 --> 04:27:40.849 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:27:40.849 --> 04:27:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
well no just as a practical matter we
 
04:27:45.769 --> 04:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
have a holiday on the second Monday in
 
04:27:47.330 --> 04:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
October I think it's good to have a
 
04:27:47.340 --> 04:27:48.830 align:start position:0%
October I think it's good to have a
holiday

04:27:48.830 --> 04:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
holiday
 
04:27:51.710 --> 04:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
holiday in October for uh
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know for reasons Beyond just
 
04:27:55.729 --> 04:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day like in Canada
 
04:27:57.110 --> 04:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's when they celebrate their
 
04:27:58.250 --> 04:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving so I think we should
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
continue to have an official holiday in
 
04:28:02.450 --> 04:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
mid-october I I think uh the Columbus
 
04:28:05.090 --> 04:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
Day celebration except amongst political
 
04:28:07.490 --> 04:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
types uh is has kind of Gone by the
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
wayside so like the indigenous people's
 
04:28:11.570 --> 04:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
day it's actually much more vibrant
 
04:28:15.050 --> 04:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
celebration so October has become a
 
04:28:17.149 --> 04:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
October Monday in October and the entire
 
04:28:19.490 --> 04:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
month of October has has unofficially
 
04:28:21.769 --> 04:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
become indigenous people say uh
 
04:28:24.889 --> 04:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
business people's day uh celebration and
 
04:28:27.050 --> 04:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
I think that should I think I think I
 
04:28:29.330 --> 04:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
think we should uh honor that by uh
 
04:28:30.889 --> 04:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
making an official holiday because we
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
are we did my ancestors on a well
 
04:28:35.450 --> 04:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
especially my mother's side uh
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
she's a part Irish but mostly English
 
04:28:40.429 --> 04:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
and Scottish internment they did uh
 
04:28:42.950 --> 04:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
frankly you know steal the continent
 
04:28:45.110 --> 04:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
from uh from the native peoples who are
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
living there peacefully and uh in fact
 
04:28:47.279 --> 04:28:48.889 align:start position:0%
living there peacefully and uh in fact
actually

04:28:48.889 --> 04:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:28:50.450 --> 04:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
um I even know some
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
some of my relatives were even related
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
to George Washington so like I'm
 
04:28:53.640 --> 04:28:54.950 align:start position:0%
to George Washington so like I'm
partially

04:28:54.950 --> 04:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
partially
 
04:28:56.450 --> 04:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
so they're partially to blame for what
 
04:28:57.769 --> 04:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
happened when he judged we heard about a
 
04:28:59.630 --> 04:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago so you know that's uh
 
04:29:02.750 --> 04:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I'm proud of their proud of
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
some of what my ancestors did and
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
ashamed of ashamed of others but I think
 
04:29:08.750 --> 04:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh I think we need to I think we need to
 
04:29:11.570 --> 04:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
honor the uh honor the people who whose
 
04:29:14.090 --> 04:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh land who we are occupying so that's
 
04:29:16.610 --> 04:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
that's why uh that's what I think that's
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
why that's why I think we need the
 
04:29:19.490 --> 04:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
official indigenous people's day
 
04:29:22.130 --> 04:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
holidays so thank you representative
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%

04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%

04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
no are there is are there any questions
 
04:29:32.450 --> 04:29:32.460 align:start position:0%

uh good afternoon honorable members of
 
04:29:47.689 --> 04:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Amanda
 
04:29:49.969 --> 04:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth toll I represent Cheshire 16
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
which encompasses the city of Keene at
 
04:29:55.729 --> 04:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
large I am here in support of HB 155
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
this bill renames Columbus Day as
 
04:29:59.809 --> 04:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day for the purposes
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the state holiday the history of
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
colonization and the violence that came
 
04:30:07.750 --> 04:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
along with it should not be celebrated
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
instead of honoring the oppressor let's
 
04:30:12.769 --> 04:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
honor celebrate and learn about the
 
04:30:14.689 --> 04:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
history and culture of Native Americans
 
04:30:17.149 --> 04:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer questions thank you
 
04:30:19.309 --> 04:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony
 
04:30:27.710 --> 04:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:31.929 --> 04:30:31.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.590 --> 04:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
hi uh my system just rebooted uh I'm uh
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards representing
 
04:30:42.410 --> 04:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
Auburn Chester and Sandown uh today I'm
 
04:30:45.710 --> 04:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
coming to the committee introducing two
 
04:30:45.720 --> 04:30:46.910 align:start position:0%
coming to the committee introducing two
amendments

04:30:46.910 --> 04:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
the the central theme of these two
 
04:30:53.330 --> 04:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
amendments is that it recognizes and
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
leverages the good work of the United
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
Nations which designated in 1972 in a
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
World's indigenous people's day as
 
04:31:09.610 --> 04:31:09.620 align:start position:0%
August 9th and uh and given
 
04:31:12.410 --> 04:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
all of the Enlightenment that's happened
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
to us over the last 40 50 years I think
 
04:31:18.110 --> 04:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's really important to
 
04:31:20.570 --> 04:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
um to be the change we wish to see in
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
others that we should be looking for
 
04:31:25.070 --> 04:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
ways to be more inclusive and to
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
celebrate more cultures and so for that
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
reason I I do think that an indigenous
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
people's day is is an appropriate way to
 
04:31:37.729 --> 04:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
go I my amendments put it on August 9th
 
04:31:40.790 --> 04:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
so that it is consistent with a world
 
04:31:40.800 --> 04:31:42.710 align:start position:0%
so that it is consistent with a world
holiday

04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
holiday
 
04:31:44.769 --> 04:31:44.779 align:start position:0%
um and that way we can just leverage
 
04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
Global celebrations I I would like to
 
04:31:52.250 --> 04:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
leave Columbus Day alone out of the
 
04:31:54.849 --> 04:31:54.859 align:start position:0%
spirit of inclusiveness
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
there seems to be an explicit effort to
 
04:32:01.969 --> 04:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
destroy and rewrite a major part of
 
04:32:05.149 --> 04:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
American History that's in here
 
04:32:08.210 --> 04:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't think that's
 
04:32:12.050 --> 04:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
particularly wise I I would say that if
 
04:32:14.570 --> 04:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
we look at history and if we'll look at
 
04:32:16.450 --> 04:32:16.460 align:start position:0%
mankind throughout history
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
civilization has always been a very
 
04:32:20.170 --> 04:32:20.180 align:start position:0%
fragile thing
 
04:32:23.050 --> 04:32:23.060 align:start position:0%
and the the thing that destroys
 
04:32:28.189 --> 04:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
civilizations is uh the scarcity and we
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
we stand here now in 2021 in a land
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
where we take our luxuries for granted
 
04:32:38.570 --> 04:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
everything we need we can get pretty
 
04:32:42.110 --> 04:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
quickly and and we don't operate in the
 
04:32:47.149 --> 04:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
scarcity of 500 years ago we we can't
 
04:32:51.649 --> 04:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
judge directly the the man's inhumanity
 
04:32:55.309 --> 04:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
to man 500 years ago but what we can
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
honor if we continue to recognize
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day is the spirit of
 
04:33:03.290 --> 04:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
exploration and the and and the idea
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
that the uh that that this nation has
 
04:33:10.609 --> 04:33:10.619 align:start position:0%
been developed primarily by an
 
04:33:13.970 --> 04:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
Explorer's spirit and that that Explorer
 
04:33:17.090 --> 04:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
spirit is with us still as we go to
 
04:33:19.490 --> 04:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
we've gone to the Moon as we continue to
 
04:33:22.609 --> 04:33:22.619 align:start position:0%
explore space and we continue to explore
 
04:33:26.090 --> 04:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
the ocean I think Columbus Day is still
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
a great reminder of an important part of
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
the American Spirit and and there's I I
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
get that we want to acknowledge the
 
04:33:38.449 --> 04:33:38.459 align:start position:0%
Native Americans who were here before uh
 
04:33:41.330 --> 04:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
Europeans began to settle
 
04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I get that but I think to be fair if
 
04:33:47.449 --> 04:33:47.459 align:start position:0%
we were to go back 500 years and start
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
to look at the Native Americans their
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
cultures probably had violence they
 
04:33:55.449 --> 04:33:55.459 align:start position:0%
probably had rape they probably had
 
04:33:59.090 --> 04:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
man's inhumanity to man because that was
 
04:34:01.429 --> 04:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
just life 500 years ago and we're not
 
04:34:05.570 --> 04:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
living then so uh I I I would hope that
 
04:34:07.490 --> 04:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
you would positively consider one of the
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
two amendments you can either name
 
04:34:11.929 --> 04:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
August 9th as a world indigenous
 
04:34:14.029 --> 04:34:14.039 align:start position:0%
people's day or just simply indigenous
 
04:34:16.250 --> 04:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
people's day directly after the ibanki
 
04:34:18.890 --> 04:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
tribe of uh it's that certainly lived in
 
04:34:20.810 --> 04:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
this region so
 
04:34:22.910 --> 04:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
um so I I think uh I think what we need
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
to do is spread love and not hate
 
04:34:28.369 --> 04:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
so I'll take questions if you have any
 
04:34:30.349 --> 04:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
Edwards representative
 
04:34:35.209 --> 04:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
there's a question from Mr Edwards
 
04:34:37.970 --> 04:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
um representative Edwards I'm sorry Mr
 
04:34:40.689 --> 04:34:40.699 align:start position:0%
Edwards representative did I say that
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah well apologies
 
04:34:44.160 --> 04:34:46.670 align:start position:0%
yeah well apologies
um

04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
you rightly expressed concern I have to
 
04:34:50.929 --> 04:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I have to provide a little
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
context before I connect my question the
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
rightly expressed concern about the fact
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
that 500 years ago there was violence
 
04:35:00.240 --> 04:35:01.369 align:start position:0%
that 500 years ago there was violence
everywhere

04:35:01.369 --> 04:35:01.379 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
and should we be celebrating this with
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
an indigenous people's day at all is
 
04:35:07.849 --> 04:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
going to be my question but let me
 
04:35:09.170 --> 04:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
provide a little context to the
 
04:35:11.689 --> 04:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples of the Americas and
 
04:35:14.330 --> 04:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
the Caribbean basis Basin because we we
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
know that Columbus didn't land on North
 
04:35:15.840 --> 04:35:16.789 align:start position:0%
know that Columbus didn't land on North
America

04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
America
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
like all of the peoples of the world
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
including the Europeans
 
04:35:24.289 --> 04:35:24.299 align:start position:0%
war and Conquest were a way of life
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
by way of example the Arawaks who
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
dominated the northern Caribbean Basin
 
04:35:31.250 --> 04:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
were quite roll out uh warlike making
 
04:35:33.250 --> 04:35:33.260 align:start position:0%
sex slaves of their women captives
 
04:35:36.349 --> 04:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
castrating or eating their male captives
 
04:35:38.929 --> 04:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
this wasn't limited to the aloe act but
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
this was similar for the Brazilian to
 
04:35:43.609 --> 04:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
penamba similar for the Brazilian I'm
 
04:35:46.010 --> 04:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
sorry for the Peruvian Uki Ali the
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
Toshiba the Aztec the Mayans and other
 
04:35:49.970 --> 04:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
prominent tribes and Nations
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
War making ritual sacrifice cannibalism
 
04:35:56.090 --> 04:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
and slave taking are these the
 
04:35:57.789 --> 04:35:57.799 align:start position:0%
principles that we're trying to advance
 
04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
in replacement of Columbus Day
 
04:36:03.529 --> 04:36:03.539 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll just uh I'll leave it there
 
04:36:03.539 --> 04:36:04.730 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll just uh I'll leave it there
and

04:36:04.730 --> 04:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
ask you to answer that and address it in
 
04:36:09.230 --> 04:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
any way you choose well thank you for
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
the question I I would say that
 
04:36:15.949 --> 04:36:15.959 align:start position:0%
um given the luxuries that we have today
 
04:36:18.769 --> 04:36:18.779 align:start position:0%
that we should look at the history of
 
04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
mankind as a source of learning about
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
ways to improve civilization that
 
04:36:31.250 --> 04:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
eradicating the past and and not
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
exploiting the positive parts of it uh
 
04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
is is a mistake like for example the
 
04:36:40.990 --> 04:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
Magna Carta was founded or written in uh
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
1066 I believe so so even though there's
 
04:36:48.369 --> 04:36:48.379 align:start position:0%
much to criticize
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
European culture uh against uh that the
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
the 500 years ago there's also great
 
04:36:58.189 --> 04:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
things to celebrate and and I I think
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
that we ought to be able to do both we
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to celebrate and we
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to identify
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
the things that we think need to be
 
04:37:08.330 --> 04:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
improved whether it's in European
 
04:37:11.209 --> 04:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
Society American society you know the
 
04:37:13.551 --> 04:37:13.561 align:start position:0%
Native Americans weren't perfect so we
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
should not idealize them in a way that
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
creates a mythology of on its own that
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
somebody 40 years from now is going to
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
come back and try to eradicate so I I
 
04:37:28.131 --> 04:37:28.141 align:start position:0%
just think we we share the maturity to
 
04:37:31.369 --> 04:37:31.379 align:start position:0%
look at the totality of history in in
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
man's development and how fragile
 
04:37:36.289 --> 04:37:36.299 align:start position:0%
civilization is and and just work to
 
04:37:38.631 --> 04:37:38.641 align:start position:0%
make ours stronger and better and you do
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
that by including people you don't do
 
04:37:45.529 --> 04:37:45.539 align:start position:0%
that by isolating groups and diminishing
 
04:37:48.650 --> 04:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
them that that that's destructive thank
 
04:37:50.330 --> 04:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
you I agree with you
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:57.650 --> 04:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm glad to see
 
04:38:00.830 --> 04:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
you in our committee representative
 
04:38:00.840 --> 04:38:01.849 align:start position:0%
you in our committee representative
um

04:38:01.849 --> 04:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:04.910 --> 04:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
two things one is
 
04:38:07.310 --> 04:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
um did you know that there still are
 
04:38:09.709 --> 04:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
indigenous people living in New
 
04:38:12.410 --> 04:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and my second
 
04:38:15.289 --> 04:38:15.299 align:start position:0%
um question is did you know that this
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
bill comes from a movement that's
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
already taken hold in lots of places in
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:38:25.730 --> 04:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
to specifically replace Columbus Day
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
I I think I know both of those things
 
04:38:33.410 --> 04:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
um uh I I I would just say that it's
 
04:38:34.970 --> 04:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
great that this issue is coming before
 
04:38:37.970 --> 04:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
the legislature so that we can take a
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
look at it overall for the state and and
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
put our own stamp on it for what it
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
should be and I'm recommending that uh
 
04:38:48.769 --> 04:38:48.779 align:start position:0%
to you as a fellow legislator that you
 
04:38:51.769 --> 04:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
join with me in believing that Society
 
04:38:55.250 --> 04:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
needs to be tolerant and inclusive in
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
that there's a perfectly great way of
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
doing that by using the August 9th date
 
04:39:03.650 --> 04:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
that's already recognized by the U.N to
 
04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
recognize our local indigenous people
 
04:39:09.289 --> 04:39:09.299 align:start position:0%
without having to insult or offend a
 
04:39:12.529 --> 04:39:12.539 align:start position:0%
whole other group and so so like I said
 
04:39:14.810 --> 04:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
I think this is the time to be inclusive
 
04:39:18.529 --> 04:39:18.539 align:start position:0%
and tolerant and not intentionally seek
 
04:39:20.929 --> 04:39:20.939 align:start position:0%
to diminish another culture or another
 
04:39:23.689 --> 04:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
history I don't I just I don't think
 
04:39:26.449 --> 04:39:26.459 align:start position:0%
that's healthy and it's okay for us as
 
04:39:28.730 --> 04:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
elected representatives to say that on
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think you agree with me but
 
04:39:40.730 --> 04:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards are
 
04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
there additional questions for
 
04:39:45.170 --> 04:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.448 --> 04:39:47.458 align:start position:0%

James Schmidt
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh thank you very much
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
and uh thanks honorable uh chairwoman
 
04:40:02.570 --> 04:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee uh for the
 
04:40:05.150 --> 04:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jan Schmidt and I
 
04:40:07.788 --> 04:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
represent Ward one in Nashua
 
04:40:10.090 --> 04:40:10.100 align:start position:0%
uh Civil War statues are coming down
 
04:40:12.530 --> 04:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
those monuments that store deep and
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
painful memories for some Americans of
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
the violence loss death from family
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
history it's not very distant and
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
this change is moving around the country
 
04:40:26.090 --> 04:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
now think on Columbus Day is the same
 
04:40:29.330 --> 04:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
celebration it it if it gives you an
 
04:40:31.970 --> 04:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
evocative feeling for the people who are
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
asking for those Civil War statues to
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
come down that they feel the pain that
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
they were on the losing side and
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
reminded every single time
 
04:40:40.440 --> 04:40:41.150 align:start position:0%
reminded every single time
um

04:40:41.150 --> 04:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:43.550 --> 04:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
some people of Italian descent seem to
 
04:40:45.350 --> 04:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
think that this day is to celebrate
 
04:40:48.110 --> 04:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
their Heritage akin to Saint Patty's Day
 
04:40:50.150 --> 04:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the people of Irish descent but it
 
04:40:52.250 --> 04:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
really isn't it's a Federal holiday and
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's assigned to a single person if it
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
was Italian-American day that would be
 
04:40:59.448 --> 04:40:59.458 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh Italian-American Heritage
 
04:40:59.458 --> 04:41:00.250 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh Italian-American Heritage
day

04:41:00.250 --> 04:41:00.260 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
all these ideas are really terrific but
 
04:41:04.850 --> 04:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
for right now I think it's time to get
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
rid of Columbus Day and I think it's the
 
04:41:09.708 --> 04:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
best way to honor the people the people
 
04:41:11.708 --> 04:41:11.718 align:start position:0%
who are here before us
 
04:41:15.650 --> 04:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
make it about the indigenous people it's
 
04:41:17.448 --> 04:41:17.458 align:start position:0%
time to celebrate the first people and
 
04:41:19.850 --> 04:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
this is a really good move thank you for
 
04:41:21.530 --> 04:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony I'll take any
 
04:41:21.540 --> 04:41:22.610 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony I'll take any
questions

04:41:22.610 --> 04:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:41:24.470 --> 04:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there questions
 
04:41:29.810 --> 04:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:31.610 --> 04:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
I don't see any so thank you for your
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:41.150 --> 04:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
hi um I'm just a member of the public
 
04:41:43.010 --> 04:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
I'm doing I haven't done this before is
 
04:41:47.208 --> 04:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
it okay to testify yes to tell it where
 
04:41:49.310 --> 04:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
you're from and then then start talking
 
04:41:52.190 --> 04:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay I am from Campton New Hampshire
 
04:41:54.170 --> 04:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I am a professor of early American
 
04:41:57.288 --> 04:41:57.298 align:start position:0%
literature and history with an expertise
 
04:42:00.530 --> 04:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
um in Columbus and I'm also Italian so
 
04:42:02.990 --> 04:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a great day for me to be
 
04:42:03.000 --> 04:42:03.948 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a great day for me to be
here

04:42:03.948 --> 04:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
um I am speaking in support of this bill
 
04:42:10.250 --> 04:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
for two main reasons um the first is
 
04:42:13.730 --> 04:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
um as an Italian-American uh this is
 
04:42:16.128 --> 04:42:16.138 align:start position:0%
um not one of the things that I am
 
04:42:17.930 --> 04:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
culturally proud of
 
04:42:20.090 --> 04:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
um you are probably aware
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
of Columbus's impact on the native
 
04:42:28.010 --> 04:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
people but sometimes when people use the
 
04:42:30.530 --> 04:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
word genocide they think that that word
 
04:42:33.288 --> 04:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
is being tossed around casually
 
04:42:35.690 --> 04:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
um but with the indigenous people of
 
04:42:38.448 --> 04:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
Haiti we are talking about going from a
 
04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
population of about 3 million to a
 
04:42:43.310 --> 04:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
population of zero we're talking not
 
04:42:45.050 --> 04:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
just about cultural genocide but of the
 
04:42:47.930 --> 04:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
total wiping out of a of a race of of
 
04:42:49.670 --> 04:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
human beings
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of my Italian Pride I
 
04:42:55.250 --> 04:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
have a lot of it but not for this
 
04:42:57.410 --> 04:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
particular man he's also
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
um credited with starting in many ways
 
04:43:02.930 --> 04:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
the transatlantic slave trade and in
 
04:43:06.410 --> 04:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
terms of women and sexual slavery uh was
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
really integral in selling both
 
04:43:13.570 --> 04:43:13.580 align:start position:0%
um native women and young Native girls
 
04:43:18.288 --> 04:43:18.298 align:start position:0%
to his Admirals in exchange for uh land
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
so the more you learn this doesn't come
 
04:43:22.490 --> 04:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
from history books um this actually
 
04:43:25.850 --> 04:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
comes from Columbus's own journals
 
04:43:27.948 --> 04:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
written both in his own hand and the
 
04:43:29.628 --> 04:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
Hand of the classes who traveled with
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
him and his son who traveled with him so
 
04:43:33.530 --> 04:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's where my information comes from
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of direct quotes and I'd
 
04:43:37.070 --> 04:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
be happy to share those with you if if
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
they're of interest
 
04:43:41.150 --> 04:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not proud as an Italian the
 
04:43:42.770 --> 04:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
other thing is that indigenous people's
 
04:43:45.170 --> 04:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
day there are you know indigenous
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
peoples are
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
um uh diverse they speak different
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
languages they are different cultures
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
um there are you know
 
04:43:55.850 --> 04:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
um all sorts of aspects to indigenous
 
04:43:58.250 --> 04:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
culture but part of what we're honoring
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
when we change the name to indigenous
 
04:44:04.128 --> 04:44:04.138 align:start position:0%
people's day is the survival amongst
 
04:44:07.368 --> 04:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
many tribes in the face of the genocide
 
04:44:07.378 --> 04:44:08.270 align:start position:0%
many tribes in the face of the genocide
by

04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
um by Columbus and the history of the
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
Conquistadors who followed him so I
 
04:44:15.770 --> 04:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely think it's an appropriate
 
04:44:15.780 --> 04:44:16.970 align:start position:0%
absolutely think it's an appropriate
switch

04:44:16.970 --> 04:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
switch
 
04:44:20.690 --> 04:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and definitely time we've
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
done this in many places in New
 
04:44:23.930 --> 04:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already I'm proud of my own
 
04:44:25.970 --> 04:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
campus where I'm a professor at Plymouth
 
04:44:28.730 --> 04:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
State University when we changed our
 
04:44:31.310 --> 04:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
calendar after students advocated to
 
04:44:33.230 --> 04:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
make this shift and we now have
 
04:44:34.970 --> 04:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples day on our University
 
04:44:37.550 --> 04:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
calendar so I encourage you to read
 
04:44:40.810 --> 04:44:40.820 align:start position:0%
Columbus's words directly
 
04:44:44.050 --> 04:44:44.060 align:start position:0%
and to not discount
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
your Italian friends because we have a
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
lot of Pride about a lot of things about
 
04:44:52.430 --> 04:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
our culture that are are truly beautiful
 
04:44:54.890 --> 04:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
but Christopher Columbus is not one of
 
04:44:57.288 --> 04:44:57.298 align:start position:0%
them thank you for your time and thank
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.030 --> 04:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz
 
04:45:09.770 --> 04:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
04:45:12.590 --> 04:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question Ms DeRosa Professor
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
DeRosa um
 
04:45:17.810 --> 04:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
so since you're a history professor and
 
04:45:19.850 --> 04:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
in Italian maybe you can help clarify a
 
04:45:22.190 --> 04:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
point that is probably going to come up
 
04:45:24.170 --> 04:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
again I think it came up today it comes
 
04:45:27.650 --> 04:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
up often with this bill is the notion of
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
celebrating Italian Heritage and is it
 
04:45:35.448 --> 04:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
safe to say that when this holiday when
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day specifically was
 
04:45:42.530 --> 04:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
um popularized in communities that it
 
04:45:45.288 --> 04:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
was a very different
 
04:45:47.930 --> 04:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
um atmosphere around being Italian at
 
04:45:51.170 --> 04:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
that time too and how do you think that
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
atmosphere has changed
 
04:45:56.930 --> 04:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
um that is true so first I have to put a
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
disclaimer in that I am a history of
 
04:46:01.250 --> 04:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
early America so 1400
 
04:46:04.850 --> 04:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
um to about 1800 pre-civil war is my
 
04:46:06.590 --> 04:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
period so when you're talking about
 
04:46:08.510 --> 04:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day and then Italian
 
04:46:10.368 --> 04:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
immigration you're actually quite past
 
04:46:12.410 --> 04:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
my period um but I've learned some
 
04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
amazing things from my uh colleague at
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State John kruegerberg who um
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
writes and talks about this quite a bit
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
um but obviously there was a time in our
 
04:46:23.208 --> 04:46:23.218 align:start position:0%
history when Italian Americans were
 
04:46:24.910 --> 04:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
discriminated discriminated against
 
04:46:28.190 --> 04:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
similarly to Irish Americans
 
04:46:31.850 --> 04:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
um so we have that sort of immigrant
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
history that still inflexus my family is
 
04:46:37.128 --> 04:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
all um from Boston they grew up uh
 
04:46:39.770 --> 04:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
working class after my grandparents
 
04:46:41.448 --> 04:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
immigrated here
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and they you know suffered some of
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
them didn't speak English and they were
 
04:46:49.730 --> 04:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
challenged so I understand the need for
 
04:46:52.550 --> 04:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
Italian pride in a community that has
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
been historically described terminated
 
04:46:56.690 --> 04:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
against that discrimination is very
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
different than the Discrimination that
 
04:47:00.770 --> 04:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
Native Americans currently face in our
 
04:47:04.190 --> 04:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
culture as an Italian-American I have
 
04:47:07.970 --> 04:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
not faced any discrimination and the
 
04:47:10.670 --> 04:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
barriers that my families have faced
 
04:47:12.230 --> 04:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
growing up I think have have sort of
 
04:47:16.250 --> 04:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
generationally become much much milder
 
04:47:18.788 --> 04:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
um my my grandparents
 
04:47:21.770 --> 04:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
were very excited about the Boston
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day parades at no time did I
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
ever hear them excited about Christopher
 
04:47:29.530 --> 04:47:29.540 align:start position:0%
Columbus what they were excited about
 
04:47:34.550 --> 04:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
was a chance to celebrate their um their
 
04:47:38.270 --> 04:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
culture their food their language and I
 
04:47:40.610 --> 04:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
think that could have happened at any
 
04:47:43.128 --> 04:47:43.138 align:start position:0%
kind of Italian Pride Parade which I
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
would certainly be happy to endorse
 
04:47:47.570 --> 04:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
doing that in the name of Christopher
 
04:47:51.890 --> 04:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
Columbus I think is uh is a mistake and
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of the rewriting of History one
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
of the representatives talked about we
 
04:47:58.250 --> 04:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
spent many many decades rewriting
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
history many high school textbooks still
 
04:48:04.670 --> 04:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
mischaracterize Columbus as the
 
04:48:06.550 --> 04:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
discoverer of America and
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized him as the first person
 
04:48:12.410 --> 04:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
who thought the world was round of
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
course you're aware I think that he
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
actually thought the world was shaped
 
04:48:20.050 --> 04:48:20.060 align:start position:0%
like a pair whereas everybody else
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
scientifically at that time thought the
 
04:48:25.208 --> 04:48:25.218 align:start position:0%
world was round we spent a lot of time
 
04:48:27.830 --> 04:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
rewriting The Narrative of what Columbus
 
04:48:29.690 --> 04:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
believed all we're doing now is
 
04:48:33.890 --> 04:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
correcting many many years of
 
04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
um of of really just flat out wrong
 
04:48:38.690 --> 04:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
information that was transmitted mostly
 
04:48:40.850 --> 04:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
through our through our schools for for
 
04:48:43.128 --> 04:48:43.138 align:start position:0%
political reasons so it's it's time to
 
04:48:46.010 --> 04:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
fix that and we can still preserve
 
04:48:48.530 --> 04:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
Italian Heritage and pride without
 
04:48:51.050 --> 04:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
relying on the lies that shaped The
 
04:48:54.890 --> 04:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you are there other questions
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes yes representative Mr Rosa are you

yes

04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:43.440 --> 04:49:50.330 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

04:49:50.330 --> 04:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
hello Madam chair
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
hello okay you can hear me thank you
 
04:49:57.410 --> 04:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Peter Petrino from
 
04:50:04.190 --> 04:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 23 in the town of Milford
 
04:50:06.410 --> 04:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to say that I very much
 
04:50:08.448 --> 04:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
would like to see a day of recognition
 
04:50:10.730 --> 04:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
for Native Americans
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
but this particular bill
 
04:50:15.830 --> 04:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
has me personally conflicted
 
04:50:19.128 --> 04:50:19.138 align:start position:0%
as a proud Italian American I cannot in
 
04:50:22.430 --> 04:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
good conscience support this bill to do
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
so would be for me to disrespect and
 
04:50:29.208 --> 04:50:29.218 align:start position:0%
dishonor my family my parents my
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
grandparents my heritage
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
this is not to say that I support
 
04:50:35.330 --> 04:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
I recognize that many no longer hold
 
04:50:41.208 --> 04:50:41.218 align:start position:0%
Columbus in a place of honor most of us
 
04:50:43.610 --> 04:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
never knew or considered the atrocities
 
04:50:46.368 --> 04:50:46.378 align:start position:0%
his Expeditions perpetrated upon native
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
peoples so it's appropriate for us to
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
re-examine the Past
 
04:50:55.250 --> 04:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
however aside from Columbus the man and
 
04:50:58.490 --> 04:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
his deeds October 12th has long been
 
04:51:01.070 --> 04:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
celebrated by the Italian-American
 
04:51:04.368 --> 04:51:04.378 align:start position:0%
Community as a matter of ethnic pride in
 
04:51:06.650 --> 04:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
their rightful place in America
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
so is it possible for us not to throw
 
04:51:12.770 --> 04:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
out the baby with the bathwater that is
 
04:51:15.230 --> 04:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
not to recognize Columbus but to
 
04:51:17.090 --> 04:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
continue to celebrate Italian-American
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
Heritage now it should be noted that in
 
04:51:21.050 --> 04:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:51:24.650 --> 04:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
we rank seventh in the nation in terms
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the percentage of citizens who are
 
04:51:27.120 --> 04:51:29.090 align:start position:0%
of the percentage of citizens who are
Italian-American

04:51:29.090 --> 04:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
Italian-American
 
04:51:29.100 --> 04:51:30.590 align:start position:0%
Italian-American
seventh

04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
seventh
 
04:51:32.810 --> 04:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty high number
 
04:51:36.830 --> 04:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
now there is some history that many are
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
not aware of
 
04:51:40.610 --> 04:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
that may provide some context to this
 
04:51:40.620 --> 04:51:42.708 align:start position:0%
that may provide some context to this
discussion

04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
back in 1891 David Hennessey the police
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
chief of New Orleans was murdered and
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
Italian immigrants was suspect
 
04:51:53.930 --> 04:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
subsequently 250 Italian immigrants were
 
04:51:57.948 --> 04:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
rounded up eventually nine went on trial
 
04:51:59.390 --> 04:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
for murder
 
04:52:01.970 --> 04:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
they were later acquitted however
 
04:52:05.230 --> 04:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
following the acquittal on March 14 1891
 
04:52:08.448 --> 04:52:08.458 align:start position:0%
an angry mob of thousands gathered
 
04:52:11.930 --> 04:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
outside of the jail and a mob stormed
 
04:52:14.030 --> 04:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
inside very similar to what happened to
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
our nation's capital just last month
 
04:52:19.610 --> 04:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
and 11 Italian prisoners were killed
 
04:52:22.850 --> 04:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
nine was shot or clubbed to death into a
 
04:52:26.090 --> 04:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
hauled outside and they were hung and
 
04:52:26.100 --> 04:52:26.930 align:start position:0%
hauled outside and they were hung and
shot

04:52:26.930 --> 04:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
shot
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
this is one of the largest single mass
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
lynchings in American history and it's
 
04:52:34.128 --> 04:52:34.138 align:start position:0%
been said that this has been
 
04:52:36.890 --> 04:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
referred to as the lynching that gave us
 
04:52:38.930 --> 04:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day
 
04:52:41.570 --> 04:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
now upset by these events in New Orleans
 
04:52:44.570 --> 04:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
and the hash treatment of Italians
 
04:52:47.090 --> 04:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
across the country president Benjamin
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
Harrison decided to honor Italians with
 
04:52:51.470 --> 04:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
a special presidential Proclamation
 
04:52:53.330 --> 04:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
he considered the number of prominent
 
04:52:55.550 --> 04:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
Italians to recognize from Galileo to
 
04:52:57.470 --> 04:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
Leonardo da Vinci but he eventually
 
04:52:59.570 --> 04:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
settled upon Columbus since the
 
04:53:02.090 --> 04:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
following year in 1892 it marked the
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
400th anniversary of his Landing in the
 
04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
Western Hemisphere so it was a
 
04:53:08.330 --> 04:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
fortuitous coincidence
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
now needless to say Italian Americans
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
were Overjoyed finally their time had
 
04:53:14.990 --> 04:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
come the president of the United States
 
04:53:17.390 --> 04:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
had officially acknowledged their place
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
in our country
 
04:53:21.050 --> 04:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
and my grandparents arrived at Ellis
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
Island from Italy a little over a decade
 
04:53:26.330 --> 04:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
later and settled in Boston's Little
 
04:53:29.510 --> 04:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
Italy the North End where I grew up and
 
04:53:32.990 --> 04:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
were members of my family still live
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
now since president Harrison's
 
04:53:36.590 --> 04:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
Proclamation there were a number of
 
04:53:39.288 --> 04:53:39.298 align:start position:0%
movements for permanent recognition
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
Italians had been celebrating Columbus
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
Day unofficially in New York City as far
 
04:53:46.850 --> 04:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
back as 1866 but the first legal holiday
 
04:53:50.330 --> 04:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
was in Colorado in 1905 and then of
 
04:53:51.650 --> 04:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
course eventually it became a national
 
04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
holiday in 1971.
 
04:53:58.250 --> 04:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
now last year Colorado became first
 
04:53:58.260 --> 04:53:59.090 align:start position:0%
now last year Colorado became first
again

04:53:59.090 --> 04:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
addressing the controversy surrounding
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day while continuing to
 
04:54:06.050 --> 04:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
recognize Italian Americans
 
04:54:09.490 --> 04:54:09.500 align:start position:0%
Colorado replaced Columbus Day with
 
04:54:11.690 --> 04:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
Cabrini day
 
04:54:14.750 --> 04:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
commonly known as Mother Cabrini Francis
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
Xavier Cabrini was an Italian nun who
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
came to the United States in 1889 and
 
04:54:23.570 --> 04:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
she became an American citizen and she
 
04:54:26.150 --> 04:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
worked with the sick and the poor she
 
04:54:28.490 --> 04:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
established numerous schools hospitals
 
04:54:30.350 --> 04:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
and orphanages throughout the United
 
04:54:30.360 --> 04:54:34.010 align:start position:0%
and orphanages throughout the United
States

04:54:34.010 --> 04:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:36.288 --> 04:54:36.298 align:start position:0%
she is the first United States citizen
 
04:54:38.208 --> 04:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
to be canonized the Saints in the
 
04:54:40.970 --> 04:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
Catholic church and Cabrini day is the
 
04:54:43.310 --> 04:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
first paid holiday in the United States
 
04:54:45.410 --> 04:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
to recognize a woman
 
04:54:45.420 --> 04:54:46.490 align:start position:0%
to recognize a woman
so

04:54:46.490 --> 04:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
considering all of this I asked the
 
04:54:51.530 --> 04:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
committee to think about retaining this
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill to explore a way for us to
 
04:54:56.810 --> 04:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
recognize Native Americans while at the
 
04:54:58.490 --> 04:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
same time continuing the
 
04:55:00.770 --> 04:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
long-established recognition of Italian
 
04:55:04.670 --> 04:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
Americans and without Columbus
 
04:55:06.890 --> 04:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
now I know there are those who disagree
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
with my position including some very
 
04:55:12.288 --> 04:55:12.298 align:start position:0%
good friends of mine in in the house
 
04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm here looking for a middle way
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
I would never ask anyone to support
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that with dishonor any
 
04:55:25.970 --> 04:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
aspect of who they are where they came
 
04:55:28.850 --> 04:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
from or their heritage
 
04:55:32.690 --> 04:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
I pray the day comes when we extend to
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
all without prejudice the respect and
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
dignity that we each deserve thank you

Northeastern Woodlands tribes and I'm
 
04:56:55.550 --> 04:56:55.560 align:start position:0%

04:57:19.970 --> 04:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
and programs
 
04:57:24.050 --> 04:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
as such we fully endorse House Bill 155
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
and strongly recommend that this bill so
 
04:57:30.288 --> 04:57:30.298 align:start position:0%
important to the indigenous citizens of
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire be passed
 
04:57:35.448 --> 04:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
furthermore we do not endorse the
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
continued celebration of Columbus Day in
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
any capacity and therefore reject the
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment
 
04:57:46.970 --> 04:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
I now speak as a private citizen
 
04:57:50.150 --> 04:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
I gave serious thought to re-reading my
 
04:57:52.730 --> 04:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
comments from last year or perhaps from
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
the year before
 
04:57:58.730 --> 04:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
I remember a comment that one of you
 
04:57:58.740 --> 04:57:59.750 align:start position:0%
I remember a comment that one of you
made

04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
made
 
04:58:02.990 --> 04:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
last year and I quote about this being a
 
04:58:07.010 --> 04:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
left-handed attempt at reparations
 
04:58:09.350 --> 04:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
I vividly recalled the vote of last
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
year's Bill and sitting in the gallery
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
watching huge numbers of elected
 
04:58:15.708 --> 04:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
officials walk out during the discussion
 
04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
about indigenous People's State Bill and
 
04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
return to vote to table it
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
I thought about making comments about
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
how this is not about Italian people as
 
04:58:28.970 --> 04:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
I did last year in the year before and
 
04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
again this year
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
I recall educating this body about the
 
04:58:37.610 --> 04:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
horrific acts of murder of rape of
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
enslavement and of kidnapping that began
 
04:58:43.010 --> 04:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
the genocide of our indigenous peoples
 
04:58:44.930 --> 04:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
in this hemisphere
 
04:58:47.288 --> 04:58:47.298 align:start position:0%
I thought back on Dr Richard beauvair
 
04:58:49.070 --> 04:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
retired New Hampshire State
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
archaeologist informing this body that
 
04:58:54.770 --> 04:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
this state has been inhabited by the
 
04:58:57.170 --> 04:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
indigenous people for at least twelve
 
04:58:59.930 --> 04:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred years and so yes
 
04:59:04.430 --> 04:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
we did live here and we still do
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
but then I remembered that with the two
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
previous spills you already have heard
 
04:59:12.890 --> 04:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
all this I see all of your faces that I
 
04:59:14.390 --> 04:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
saw last year
 
04:59:16.850 --> 04:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
so nothing is new here
 
04:59:19.368 --> 04:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
we shared quotes from The Diary of
 
04:59:21.530 --> 04:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
Christopher Columbus himself and of
 
04:59:24.288 --> 04:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
others who traveled with him that proved
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
beyond the shadow of adult of a doubt
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
that they committed atrocities that defy
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
all reason
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
and you know that
 
04:59:36.890 --> 04:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
04:59:39.530 --> 04:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
I was raised by Republicans
 
04:59:41.930 --> 04:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
my dear parents taught me that if
 
04:59:44.030 --> 04:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
something wrong was done
 
04:59:47.690 --> 04:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
you recognize it you admit it and you
 
04:59:49.250 --> 04:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
make it right
 
04:59:51.770 --> 04:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
until this very moment the state of New
 
04:59:53.990 --> 04:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire celebrates the horrors that
 
04:59:58.670 --> 04:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
happened in the man who made them happen
 
05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know that Christopher Columbus never
 
05:00:03.650 --> 05:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
stepped foot on this land
 
05:00:06.550 --> 05:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
he did not discover these United States
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know the evil that was done by him
 
05:00:10.670 --> 05:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
and his men
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know that our indigenous ancestors
 
05:00:16.730 --> 05:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
were the first people to live here
 
05:00:20.090 --> 05:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
so I asked this question
 
05:00:20.100 --> 05:00:22.190 align:start position:0%
so I asked this question
why

05:00:22.190 --> 05:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:00:25.070 --> 05:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
why do you vote to continue to celebrate
 
05:00:29.390 --> 05:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
a lie to celebrate atrocities to
 
05:00:31.788 --> 05:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
celebrate genocide
 
05:00:34.368 --> 05:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
I challenge each of you to answer that
 
05:00:37.310 --> 05:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
question if not here in a public forum
 
05:00:40.550 --> 05:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
then in the Silence of your own home
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing is not a partisan
 
05:00:43.680 --> 05:00:46.070 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing is not a partisan
issue

05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:49.010 --> 05:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
it's a that's an excuse
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
there is a right thing to do here
 
05:00:54.890 --> 05:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
and once again I hope you have the
 
05:00:57.650 --> 05:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
courage to do it
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to my words and
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%

05:01:04.670 --> 05:01:04.680 align:start position:0%

thank you Miss Blake you're welcome
 
05:01:10.850 --> 05:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
I don't see any questions so thank you
 
05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.970 --> 05:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.980 --> 05:01:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%

05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
before when I implied that the arrow
 
05:02:02.270 --> 05:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
Acts were cannibals and more like they
 
05:02:04.368 --> 05:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
were not it was the carobs and it was
 
05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
actually the carobs that wiped out the
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:20.750 --> 05:02:20.760 align:start position:0%

Barrington New Hampshire
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to express my support for
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
establishing an indigenous people's day
 
05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
to take the place of Columbus Day I am
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
especially speaking as an
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
Italian-American woman
 
05:02:52.850 --> 05:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
I personally have no interest in being
 
05:02:55.070 --> 05:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
connected with a violent and oppressive
 
05:02:55.080 --> 05:02:56.510 align:start position:0%
connected with a violent and oppressive
man

05:02:56.510 --> 05:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
man
 
05:02:56.520 --> 05:02:57.170 align:start position:0%
man

um
 
05:03:00.530 --> 05:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
well I really do appreciate the work
 
05:03:02.510 --> 05:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
that Italians did
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
who came before me did to remove
 
05:03:09.050 --> 05:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
so much prejudice against
 
05:03:11.948 --> 05:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
Italians in the U.S
 
05:03:15.230 --> 05:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
at this point we know so much more
 
05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
about Columbus and the violence that he
 
05:03:18.120 --> 05:03:20.090 align:start position:0%
about Columbus and the violence that he
committed

05:03:20.090 --> 05:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
committed
 
05:03:23.868 --> 05:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
continuing to hold him up is someone to
 
05:03:26.990 --> 05:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
honor and be associated with it's just
 
05:03:29.330 --> 05:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
not something that I want
 
05:03:29.340 --> 05:03:30.708 align:start position:0%
not something that I want
um

05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
my father was a huge believer in social
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.878 --> 05:03:39.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:03:39.708 --> 05:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:43.628 --> 05:03:43.638 align:start position:0%
to get honest about our history and to
 
05:03:46.730 --> 05:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
make amends where we can
 
05:03:49.610 --> 05:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
um and then partly in his name Giovanni
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
antonucci I want to you know be here
 
05:03:53.930 --> 05:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
05:03:56.570 --> 05:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to
 
05:03:56.580 --> 05:03:57.410 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to
um

05:03:57.410 --> 05:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
offer the words of Pope Francis in July
 
05:04:00.240 --> 05:04:02.090 align:start position:0%
offer the words of Pope Francis in July
2015.

05:04:02.090 --> 05:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
2015.
 
05:04:04.910 --> 05:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
when he said I say this to you with
 
05:04:07.310 --> 05:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
regret many grave sins were committed
 
05:04:10.010 --> 05:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
against the native people of America in
 
05:04:12.650 --> 05:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
the name of God I humbly ask forgiveness
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
not only for the offense of the church
 
05:04:17.330 --> 05:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
herself but also for crimes committed
 
05:04:19.610 --> 05:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
against the native peoples during the
 
05:04:23.330 --> 05:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.550 --> 05:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
so it's in that spirit that I support
 
05:04:28.368 --> 05:04:28.378 align:start position:0%
ending Columbus Day and instead enacting
 
05:04:30.410 --> 05:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
an indigenous people's day here in New
 
05:04:32.448 --> 05:04:32.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's what would make me feel

05:06:12.650 --> 05:06:12.660 align:start position:0%

um is it in any way
 
05:07:06.730 --> 05:07:06.740 align:start position:0%
reasonable or correct for for
 
05:07:11.628 --> 05:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
us to see in Christopher Columbus any
 
05:07:16.730 --> 05:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
aspect of Italian culture a nation which
 
05:07:19.850 --> 05:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
um as having studied
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
the Latin language
 
05:07:26.208 --> 05:07:26.218 align:start position:0%
from my 14th year and until I graduated
 
05:07:28.970 --> 05:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
from high school and having studied
 
05:07:31.550 --> 05:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
Italian culture virtually all my life
 
05:07:33.770 --> 05:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering does Christopher Columbus
 
05:07:36.010 --> 05:07:36.020 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
05:07:40.850 --> 05:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
deserve to be celebrated as and as
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
Exemplar of Italian culture
 
05:07:45.120 --> 05:07:46.788 align:start position:0%
Exemplar of Italian culture
well

05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
well I I don't think so
 
05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
um and I was not raised with him as an
 
05:07:54.110 --> 05:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
important part really of my family or my
 
05:07:54.120 --> 05:07:55.368 align:start position:0%
important part really of my family or my
Heritage

05:07:55.368 --> 05:07:55.378 align:start position:0%
Heritage
 
05:07:57.948 --> 05:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
um he wasn't really held up as someone
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
that we were proud of
 
05:08:00.000 --> 05:08:01.190 align:start position:0%
that we were proud of
um

05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
I've again people like Mother Cabrini
 
05:08:05.040 --> 05:08:06.590 align:start position:0%
I've again people like Mother Cabrini
um

05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:09.770 --> 05:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
and so many artists and there's really
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
many wonderful Italians and
 
05:08:15.650 --> 05:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
um Christopher Columbus is not one that
 
05:08:16.970 --> 05:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
is on my
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
list as being
 
05:08:19.320 --> 05:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
list as being
um

05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
or that I was raised to think of as
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
someone that we wanted to be associated
 
05:08:24.240 --> 05:08:25.310 align:start position:0%
someone that we wanted to be associated
with

05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:08:28.030 --> 05:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't think so I I do very much
 
05:08:31.070 --> 05:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
understand the history of coming to the
 
05:08:33.288 --> 05:08:33.298 align:start position:0%
holiday and I think there are some
 
05:08:35.170 --> 05:08:35.180 align:start position:0%
important pieces you know that people
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
very much were working to make this
 
05:08:38.160 --> 05:08:39.410 align:start position:0%
very much were working to make this
country

05:08:39.410 --> 05:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
a better place for someone like me to
 
05:08:43.730 --> 05:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
live and I deeply appreciate that and I
 
05:08:46.010 --> 05:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
think the history of it and the massacre
 
05:08:47.930 --> 05:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
that took place and there's some things
 
05:08:51.050 --> 05:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
there that we can you know
 
05:08:52.970 --> 05:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
that it's good that we're learning about
 
05:08:55.550 --> 05:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I know I'm very happy to learn more
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
of that history
 
05:08:59.330 --> 05:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't feel that Christopher
 
05:09:01.810 --> 05:09:01.820 align:start position:0%
Columbus needs to be
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
the important part of that
 
05:09:08.810 --> 05:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:10.250 --> 05:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%

determination on HB 155 in regard to
 
05:09:47.090 --> 05:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
renaming Columbus Day as indigenous
 
05:09:48.288 --> 05:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
peoples today
 
05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
any other effort to create an
 
05:09:52.670 --> 05:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
alternative day for indigenous people
 
05:09:55.730 --> 05:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
stay such as August 9th uh would be to
 
05:09:57.770 --> 05:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
avoid the truth about America and it's
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's really inconsistent with the
 
05:10:01.310 --> 05:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
historical truth and as such
 
05:10:02.930 --> 05:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
continuously Narrative of social
 
05:10:02.940 --> 05:10:04.730 align:start position:0%
continuously Narrative of social
injustice

05:10:04.730 --> 05:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
injustice
 
05:10:06.948 --> 05:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
it is true idpj is an international
 
05:10:09.050 --> 05:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
movement to correct history and
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
recognize the contributions and
 
05:10:13.128 --> 05:10:13.138 align:start position:0%
sacrifices of indigenous people here and
 
05:10:17.090 --> 05:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
worldwide but these are our lands in the
 
05:10:19.970 --> 05:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
United States not in Australia or some
 
05:10:22.368 --> 05:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
other place where August 9th may have
 
05:10:24.890 --> 05:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
made sense these lands are ours for more
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
than ten thousand years before Europeans
 
05:10:30.350 --> 05:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
many of our numerous contributions and
 
05:10:32.810 --> 05:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
sacrifices to U.S society past and
 
05:10:35.868 --> 05:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
present not excluding taking on land's
 
05:10:37.610 --> 05:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
resources and our lives we're always
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
overlooked it is taught it's time to
 
05:10:42.410 --> 05:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
really stop honoring the false Narrative
 
05:10:44.930 --> 05:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
of European and religious superiority
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
and to honor the original indigenous
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
people that have given so much to this
 
05:10:50.330 --> 05:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
country in the world
 
05:10:52.610 --> 05:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
now is the time to discuss the facts of
 
05:10:54.890 --> 05:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
this holiday it's based on events that
 
05:10:56.810 --> 05:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
no civilized country should be honoring
 
05:10:59.208 --> 05:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
Columbus in his own words describes the
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
atrocities of genocide that he and his
 
05:11:03.948 --> 05:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
men and those explorers of the new the
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
age of Discovery committed against
 
05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
indigenous people of the new world
 
05:11:10.490 --> 05:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
a time when European rule is attempting
 
05:11:12.770 --> 05:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
to divide and control the world
 
05:11:15.288 --> 05:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
take over newly discovered land seeking
 
05:11:17.690 --> 05:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
the resources of gold in their peoples
 
05:11:19.128 --> 05:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
as slaves
 
05:11:22.970 --> 05:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
during the 1500s Spain which no no most
 
05:11:24.530 --> 05:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
people don't understand had a formal
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
plan of Jewish genocide removing seeds
 
05:11:29.690 --> 05:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
to lands and property of the Jewish
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
Jewish community in the Iberian
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
Peninsula spoken about the fact that
 
05:11:36.530 --> 05:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
those stolen assets of these Jewish
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
people helped fund Columbus's Global
 
05:11:38.878 --> 05:11:40.190 align:start position:0%
people helped fund Columbus's Global
ambitions

05:11:40.190 --> 05:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
ambitions
 
05:11:42.050 --> 05:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
let's go back to Columbus
 
05:11:45.050 --> 05:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
he was born in 1451 he was born in the
 
05:11:46.610 --> 05:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
Republic of Genoa
 
05:11:48.410 --> 05:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
Italy was not formally created until
 
05:11:52.368 --> 05:11:52.378 align:start position:0%
1861 400 years later he was never truly
 
05:11:54.170 --> 05:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
an Italian in that sense
 
05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
Colombo actually lived most of his life
 
05:11:59.628 --> 05:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
in Portugal and Spain Columbus as he got
 
05:12:01.970 --> 05:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
renamed was actually an agent of a
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
Spanish royalty
 
05:12:06.650 --> 05:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
and essentially a mercenary Explorer in
 
05:12:09.170 --> 05:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
exploit a fahaya he made four trips to
 
05:12:11.330 --> 05:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
the Caribbean explored the area around
 
05:12:14.090 --> 05:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
Cuba in hispanual but he never set foot
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
on North America and had no historical
 
05:12:19.010 --> 05:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
connection to the United States
 
05:12:21.288 --> 05:12:21.298 align:start position:0%
the Vikings like previously said were
 
05:12:22.910 --> 05:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
probably the first true Europeans that
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
landed in the Americas
 
05:12:27.170 --> 05:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
meeting the indigenous people which he
 
05:12:29.090 --> 05:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
mistakenly called Indians a name we
 
05:12:31.310 --> 05:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
still have to live with he commented on
 
05:12:34.730 --> 05:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
how gentle healthy peaceful kind they
 
05:12:37.670 --> 05:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
were to him and his men in his own words
 
05:12:40.070 --> 05:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
they knew not what iron was they had no
 
05:12:42.110 --> 05:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
defensive weapons and will be easily
 
05:12:42.120 --> 05:12:43.310 align:start position:0%
defensive weapons and will be easily
enslaved

05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
enslaved
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
is started and fervored the slavery
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
movement in the Americas when he brought
 
05:12:49.490 --> 05:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
back the first indigenous slaves to
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
Europe which in turn promoted the global
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
expansion of slavery into the Americas
 
05:12:56.090 --> 05:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
and into the Atlantic and that didn't
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
end until the mid-1800s
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
we could go on about as numerous acts of
 
05:13:02.810 --> 05:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
Cruelty and genocide during his visits
 
05:13:05.390 --> 05:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
to the Caribbean they were so brutal and
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
descriptive it was shameful these were
 
05:13:11.030 --> 05:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
acts of brutality a horrific nature
 
05:13:12.650 --> 05:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
against peaceful men and women and
 
05:13:14.930 --> 05:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
children who had no resources to defend
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
themselves these atrocities were
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
committed at acts of entertainment for
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
his men this is how we controlled and
 
05:13:23.930 --> 05:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
dominate those he preferred and he
 
05:13:25.730 --> 05:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
wanted to make peaceful indigenous
 
05:13:27.288 --> 05:13:27.298 align:start position:0%
people that he would put into
 
05:13:27.298 --> 05:13:28.550 align:start position:0%
people that he would put into
enslavement

05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
enslavement
 
05:13:31.010 --> 05:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's a holiday you know Columbus day has
 
05:13:32.690 --> 05:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
been observed in various communities
 
05:13:36.070 --> 05:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
with Italian immigrants from the late 18
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
1700s it started in New York and and in
 
05:13:42.110 --> 05:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
in Boston as well as a nationalist
 
05:13:44.570 --> 05:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
movement for Italians it was promoted by
 
05:13:45.770 --> 05:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
the Knights of Columbus which was
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
established in 1882. most of uh we have
 
05:13:51.050 --> 05:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
to reflect now on most of our national
 
05:13:52.850 --> 05:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
and state holidays were set with very
 
05:13:55.010 --> 05:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
high standards and reasons for making an
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
honoring holiday
 
05:13:57.890 --> 05:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
now that we know some of the facts
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding Columbus would you consider
 
05:14:01.788 --> 05:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
re-establishing a holiday to honor him
 
05:14:04.250 --> 05:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
today I question whether that would make
 
05:14:06.650 --> 05:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
sense this is not a matter of honoring
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
Italians this is about the continuing
 
05:14:10.910 --> 05:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
honoring of a man who committed genocide
 
05:14:13.610 --> 05:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
slavery in many acts against humanity
 
05:14:15.770 --> 05:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
this is about correcting the Injustice
 
05:14:17.930 --> 05:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
of history in the Americas
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
to the Counterpoint we would very
 
05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
strongly support a special Italian
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
holiday to honor people like Leonardo da
 
05:14:28.310 --> 05:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
Vinci Galileo Marco Polo Marconi for
 
05:14:30.830 --> 05:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
many and many many of us some of which
 
05:14:33.650 --> 05:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
were known to be U.S citizens and did
 
05:14:35.810 --> 05:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
great things for the America
 
05:14:39.070 --> 05:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
so with that I say thank you please vote
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%

05:14:58.680 --> 05:15:03.340 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:15:03.340 --> 05:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:14.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:15:14.530 --> 05:15:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:17.868 --> 05:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
yes can you hear me yes thank you okay
 
05:15:20.510 --> 05:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes yeah my name is ismaelini and I'm
 
05:15:23.930 --> 05:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
speaking in strong support of this bill
 
05:15:25.788 --> 05:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
um this is literally a continuation of
 
05:15:28.610 --> 05:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
the racism we refuse to make right I
 
05:15:30.110 --> 05:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
also want to start off by acknowledging
 
05:15:31.970 --> 05:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
the land that we're on and respect the
 
05:15:34.190 --> 05:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
ability people who are the proper
 
05:15:36.410 --> 05:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
stewards of the land that we are all on
 
05:15:36.420 --> 05:15:37.250 align:start position:0%
stewards of the land that we are all on
now

05:15:37.250 --> 05:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:15:39.050 --> 05:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
um it is not okay that we're over here
 
05:15:41.090 --> 05:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
and we want to respect the wishes of
 
05:15:44.270 --> 05:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
some Italians that need a hero in a man
 
05:15:47.030 --> 05:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
who brought genocide while disrespecting
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
the Italians who are saying this is not
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
the proper way to celebrate Italian
 
05:15:54.050 --> 05:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
Heritage in this state why would we want
 
05:15:56.090 --> 05:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
to rob a man who took thousands of
 
05:15:58.610 --> 05:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
indigenous people as slaves and utilize
 
05:16:00.650 --> 05:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
it utilized them
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
um took selling women into sexual
 
05:16:05.690 --> 05:16:05.700 align:start position:0%
slavery and murdered so many people this
 
05:16:08.448 --> 05:16:08.458 align:start position:0%
is not honoring a culture it's honoring
 
05:16:10.670 --> 05:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
a man who brought genocide on a people
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
as some Italians have already said so
 
05:16:15.530 --> 05:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
eloquent currently this is not the
 
05:16:17.990 --> 05:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
Italian History that they are proud of
 
05:16:20.030 --> 05:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
and not the Italian History our state
 
05:16:22.730 --> 05:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
should be a proud of so we should not be
 
05:16:24.770 --> 05:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
celebrating the spirit of exploration
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
that destroys a people and a culture
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
what kind of message would that be
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
sending to our children like let's
 
05:16:32.930 --> 05:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
explore and it's okay to hurt people
 
05:16:36.170 --> 05:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
while we're exploring no so we're just
 
05:16:38.208 --> 05:16:38.218 align:start position:0%
respecting people by keeping Columbus
 
05:16:41.208 --> 05:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
Day it's a slap on the face for people
 
05:16:44.448 --> 05:16:44.458 align:start position:0%
that we never really did right by from
 
05:16:46.490 --> 05:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
our mistakes so
 
05:16:48.530 --> 05:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
also this is not about including history
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
we should never remove the history that
 
05:16:53.050 --> 05:16:53.060 align:start position:0%
everyone needs to know about it's about
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
honoring bad history instead of looking
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
at this is a sad part of our history so
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
this day should have been removed long
 
05:17:04.010 --> 05:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
ago and it's time we make things right
 
05:17:07.430 --> 05:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
in a small Way by naming this indigenous
 
05:17:09.948 --> 05:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
people's day as a token of acknowledging
 
05:17:12.890 --> 05:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
the harms done to a community that we
 
05:17:14.890 --> 05:17:14.900 align:start position:0%
acknowledge their presence still today
 
05:17:17.448 --> 05:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
and that they still face so much
 
05:17:20.208 --> 05:17:20.218 align:start position:0%
discrimination even today for these
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
reasons we should have removed this day
 
05:17:24.410 --> 05:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
long ago and honor those who deserve to
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
be honored and we have yet Done Right by
 
05:17:30.770 --> 05:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
so please vote Yes on this bill
 
05:17:33.050 --> 05:17:33.060 align:start position:0%

05:19:27.890 --> 05:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chairman and uh members of the
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record uh my name
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
is William Thomas and I reside in Auburn
 
05:19:35.270 --> 05:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:19:39.470 --> 05:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
I am a retired uh Civics and history
 
05:19:42.410 --> 05:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
teacher at Manchester Central High
 
05:19:48.050 --> 05:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
School and I am supporting uh House Bill
 
05:19:52.670 --> 05:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
155 replacing Columbus Day uh I'm just
 
05:19:55.910 --> 05:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
curious if anybody received the uh
 
05:19:59.208 --> 05:19:59.218 align:start position:0%
written testimony I sent in
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes we did thank you okay thank you so
 
05:20:06.170 --> 05:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
let me start by saying I uh I I I taught
 
05:20:08.690 --> 05:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
history but I'm not really a historian
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
but I think history and I would mention
 
05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh and I always did mention my students
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
let's not forget her story in thinking
 
05:20:21.948 --> 05:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
of Granny D and owner judge and the
 
05:20:25.128 --> 05:20:25.138 align:start position:0%
woman in Dover and others who have you
 
05:20:27.708 --> 05:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
know through the years been uh largely
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
forgotten but anyway I think history or
 
05:20:34.490 --> 05:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
history invites us to re-examine what we
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
think we know about history or her story
 
05:20:40.850 --> 05:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
often by discovering new sources of
 
05:20:43.850 --> 05:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
information especially and I tried to
 
05:20:46.190 --> 05:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
emphasize this with my students in
 
05:20:48.890 --> 05:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
looking at not just their textbook but
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
other uh information in terms of primary
 
05:20:55.128 --> 05:20:55.138 align:start position:0%
sources what is a primary source what is
 
05:20:58.250 --> 05:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
a secondary source uh third hand Source
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
Etc and we we do know has been mentioned
 
05:21:04.570 --> 05:21:04.580 align:start position:0%
previously that Columbus kept a journal
 
05:21:09.170 --> 05:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
we know that the Spanish priest the Las
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
Casas who accompanied him on three of
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
his voyages kept a journal we know they
 
05:21:15.170 --> 05:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
exist they're in Spain they've been
 
05:21:19.128 --> 05:21:19.138 align:start position:0%
translated and so we have evidence in
 
05:21:22.490 --> 05:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
the Admiral's own words about the sexual
 
05:21:27.050 --> 05:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
slavery about the uh the genocide that
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
he and his men initiated
 
05:21:34.250 --> 05:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
so and I think of uh and I've used a
 
05:21:36.530 --> 05:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
textbook called The People's History of
 
05:21:39.288 --> 05:21:39.298 align:start position:0%
the United States by Howard Zen at least
 
05:21:41.448 --> 05:21:41.458 align:start position:0%
the first chapter excerpts called
 
05:21:43.850 --> 05:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
Columbus the Indians and human progress
 
05:21:47.170 --> 05:21:47.180 align:start position:0%
or lack thereof and
 
05:21:50.448 --> 05:21:50.458 align:start position:0%
Zen comments on one famous historian
 
05:21:54.830 --> 05:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
from Harvard uh Samuel Elliott Morrison
 
05:21:58.850 --> 05:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
who actually replicated by taking a a
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
ship tracing Columbus's Voyage the first
 
05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh from Spain through the Canary Islands
 
05:22:07.010 --> 05:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
to the Bahamas
 
05:22:07.020 --> 05:22:08.350 align:start position:0%
to the Bahamas
and

05:22:08.350 --> 05:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:11.448 --> 05:22:11.458 align:start position:0%
interestingly uh Morrison admired
 
05:22:16.788 --> 05:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
Columbus tremendously and uh at the same
 
05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
time he said yeah he had some flaws he
 
05:22:22.190 --> 05:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
had some uh
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh problems but but basically he praised
 
05:22:29.810 --> 05:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
his semenship and I read other stories
 
05:22:32.690 --> 05:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh accounts by historians where the
 
05:22:35.330 --> 05:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
other two uh captains of the of the
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
three ships that went to on the first
 
05:22:41.330 --> 05:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
voyage were better Pilots uh than
 
05:22:44.090 --> 05:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
Columbus but anyway then you have on the
 
05:22:45.470 --> 05:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
opposite side
 
05:22:48.910 --> 05:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
we see this historian David standard
 
05:22:51.890 --> 05:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
saying the destruction of the Indians of
 
05:22:55.070 --> 05:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
the Americas was Far and Away the most
 
05:22:59.570 --> 05:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
active Act of genocide in the history of
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
the world and by the way uh now it comes
 
05:23:04.610 --> 05:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
to mind I forget the representative
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
Italian from I think Milford who who did
 
05:23:11.330 --> 05:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
comment on the Italians who were killed
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
in 1891. my account where I read that
 
05:23:18.288 --> 05:23:18.298 align:start position:0%
was it was 13 Sicilian and I'm not sure
 
05:23:19.628 --> 05:23:19.638 align:start position:0%
if if
 
05:23:23.330 --> 05:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
not denigrating either Italians or
 
05:23:26.090 --> 05:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
Sicilians but but uh that was the
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
comment I recall reading so another
 
05:23:32.330 --> 05:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
historian and this is important I think
 
05:23:35.330 --> 05:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
to point out uh his name was basil
 
05:23:35.340 --> 05:23:36.470 align:start position:0%
to point out uh his name was basil
Davidson

05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
Davidson
 
05:23:39.770 --> 05:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
he assigns responsibility to to Columbus
 
05:23:43.730 --> 05:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
for initiating the African slave trade
 
05:23:45.948 --> 05:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
to the Americas he said the first
 
05:23:48.350 --> 05:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
license granted and he did his research
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
to send enslaved Africans to the
 
05:23:53.330 --> 05:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
Caribbean was issued by the king and
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
queen in 1501 when Columbus himself was
 
05:24:01.128 --> 05:24:01.138 align:start position:0%
the ruler in the Indies leading Davidson
 
05:24:04.850 --> 05:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
to dub Columbus the father of the slave
 
05:24:07.610 --> 05:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
trade so again when we think of honoring
 
05:24:08.590 --> 05:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
this man
 
05:24:13.250 --> 05:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
not only with the genocide of some
 
05:24:15.350 --> 05:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
historians have estimated over a hundred
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
million he initiated that plus the
 
05:24:21.890 --> 05:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
African slave trade I I I have to say I
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think he is worthy of that honor
 
05:24:29.690 --> 05:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
and so this is why I do support uh
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples today and one last
 
05:24:32.400 --> 05:24:33.288 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples today and one last
thing

05:24:33.288 --> 05:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh there's an acquaintance of mine who's
 
05:24:39.170 --> 05:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
a retired teacher who's the editor of a
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
magazine called rethinking schools his
 
05:24:45.590 --> 05:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
name is Bill Bigelow and and Mr Bigelow
 
05:24:48.650 --> 05:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
says if indigenous peoples lives matter
 
05:24:51.770 --> 05:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
in our society and if black people's
 
05:24:54.650 --> 05:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
lives mattered in our society it would
 
05:24:57.590 --> 05:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
be inconceivable that we would honor the
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
father of the slave trade with a
 
05:25:01.910 --> 05:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
national holiday
 
05:25:04.810 --> 05:25:04.820 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have this holiday
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
legitimizes a curriculum that is
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
contemptuous of the lives of people of
 
05:25:11.280 --> 05:25:12.470 align:start position:0%
contemptuous of the lives of people of
color

05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
color
 
05:25:14.690 --> 05:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
Elementary School libraries still
 
05:25:16.910 --> 05:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
feature books like quote follow the
 
05:25:19.150 --> 05:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
dream the story of Christopher Columbus
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
by Peter sis s-i-s
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
who which Praises Columbus and says
 
05:25:28.610 --> 05:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
nothing of the life destroyed by Spanish
 
05:25:32.530 --> 05:25:32.540 align:start position:0%
colonialism in the Americas so basically
 
05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh I mean I know Durham Hopkinton I know
 
05:25:41.930 --> 05:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
cities like Minneapolis Seattle and I
 
05:25:44.750 --> 05:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
think Portland Alaska was the first
 
05:25:47.090 --> 05:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
state to declare indigenous people's day
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that's going on is
 
05:25:54.410 --> 05:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
occurring uh International in the U.N
 
05:25:56.930 --> 05:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples day of spine except
 
05:25:59.810 --> 05:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
when we we stop and reflect about the
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
force being cut down in the Amazon where
 
05:26:04.910 --> 05:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
indigenous people live in Madagascar
 
05:26:08.208 --> 05:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
Madagascar Etc uh that's not really
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
honoring them as well a day we need to
 
05:26:15.050 --> 05:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
make real uh what happened and and what
 
05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
happened was a genocide a holocaust if
 
05:26:21.230 --> 05:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
you will of indigenous people so I'd be
 
05:26:23.570 --> 05:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%

any other generations of our family
 
05:27:20.940 --> 05:27:21.530 align:start position:0%
any other generations of our family
um

05:27:21.530 --> 05:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:24.110 --> 05:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
I really don't think it's a moment of
 
05:27:27.050 --> 05:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
Pride for Italian Americans I know no
 
05:27:28.670 --> 05:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
one in my family
 
05:27:30.470 --> 05:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
would definitely support him being
 
05:27:30.480 --> 05:27:31.490 align:start position:0%
would definitely support him being
celebrated

05:27:31.490 --> 05:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
celebrated
 
05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
and as all branch and in the spirit of
 
05:27:36.590 --> 05:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
inclusion I ask why don't you celebrate
 
05:27:38.750 --> 05:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
January 7th known as Flag Day in Italy
 
05:27:41.510 --> 05:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
or something to that effect
 
05:27:43.250 --> 05:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
um I can't remember the other prior
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
holiday I think it was kabini I
 
05:27:47.448 --> 05:27:47.458 align:start position:0%
apologize if I'm asking her that
 
05:27:49.550 --> 05:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
pronunciation I think that would be an
 
05:27:51.230 --> 05:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
adequate substitution
 
05:27:53.330 --> 05:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
now an acknowledgment of my Native
 
05:27:55.610 --> 05:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
American Heritage I am a descendant of
 
05:27:57.830 --> 05:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
an Abenaki tribe whose knowledge I do
 
05:27:59.390 --> 05:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
not have due to it being lost by
 
05:28:01.850 --> 05:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
generational alcoholism
 
05:28:04.670 --> 05:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
now I think that the trauma is inflicted
 
05:28:04.680 --> 05:28:06.470 align:start position:0%
now I think that the trauma is inflicted
by

05:28:06.470 --> 05:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:28:06.480 --> 05:28:08.270 align:start position:0%
by
Columbus's

05:28:08.270 --> 05:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
Columbus's
 
05:28:10.670 --> 05:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
brutal imperialistic campaign where he
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
was even brought back to Spain and tried
 
05:28:14.030 --> 05:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
for his crimes
 
05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
and was actually exiled for many
 
05:28:18.050 --> 05:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
European countries due to them
 
05:28:19.610 --> 05:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
I really don't think this is someone
 
05:28:21.890 --> 05:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
that merits any celebration other than
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
maybe the fact that he couldn't even
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:28.320 --> 05:28:29.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:28:29.150 --> 05:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:30.830 --> 05:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
nobody's trying to slight Italian
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
Americans but
 
05:28:34.368 --> 05:28:34.378 align:start position:0%
I just can't really understand where
 
05:28:35.990 --> 05:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
this sentiment's coming from
 
05:28:37.490 --> 05:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
this holiday wasn't even conceived until
 
05:28:39.110 --> 05:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
the 1970s
 
05:28:41.690 --> 05:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
so why don't we stop with this
 
05:28:43.310 --> 05:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
information and start speaking to the
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
truth thank you very much
 
05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Klein are there any other
 
05:28:58.490 --> 05:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:14.270 --> 05:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:16.250 --> 05:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Smith
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:21.890 --> 05:29:21.900 align:start position:0%
hello um
 
05:29:24.590 --> 05:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh there's time I've done this I didn't
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
realize this was speak I'm sorry
 
05:29:29.270 --> 05:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I have to rename this because this is
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
Sarah Smith
 
05:29:34.550 --> 05:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm Sarah Smith I uh it I live in
 
05:29:37.550 --> 05:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
Pembroke New Hampshire
 
05:29:40.368 --> 05:29:40.378 align:start position:0%
um I've represented here by Diane
 
05:29:40.378 --> 05:29:41.750 align:start position:0%
um I've represented here by Diane
schuett

05:29:41.750 --> 05:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
schuett
 
05:29:46.190 --> 05:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm a retired school teacher and I
 
05:29:48.050 --> 05:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
would like to um
 
05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention that
 
05:29:54.050 --> 05:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
that uh holidays are celebrated in
 
05:29:54.060 --> 05:29:55.310 align:start position:0%
that uh holidays are celebrated in
schools

05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:29:57.770 --> 05:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
um and part of the curriculum
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
is to celebrate the holidays the social
 
05:30:02.750 --> 05:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
studies curriculum of the second graders
 
05:30:05.690 --> 05:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
is to celebrate learn about the holidays
 
05:30:08.690 --> 05:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
that we celebrate so
 
05:30:12.050 --> 05:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
um I would like you to picture uh
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
a bunch of seven-year-olds
 
05:30:17.930 --> 05:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
learning about Christopher Columbus
 
05:30:20.690 --> 05:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
and how would it and knowing what we
 
05:30:22.930 --> 05:30:22.940 align:start position:0%
know about Christopher Columbus now
 
05:30:26.570 --> 05:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
would you have the teachers lie to them
 
05:30:28.970 --> 05:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
about what he did
 
05:30:31.190 --> 05:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
how would you have them approach it
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
celebrating this man whatever if you
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
tell them that well just sanitize it
 
05:30:39.170 --> 05:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
don't say anything about that other
 
05:30:41.270 --> 05:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
stuff because it really is too shocking
 
05:30:43.788 --> 05:30:43.798 align:start position:0%
for second graders
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
to learn about
 
05:30:49.610 --> 05:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
um then then they begin they've had a
 
05:30:52.368 --> 05:30:52.378 align:start position:0%
false history planted in their mind
 
05:30:54.770 --> 05:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
and these false histories have a
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
tendency to last a long time as you're
 
05:30:59.990 --> 05:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
probably aware having Having learned
 
05:31:03.770 --> 05:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
several of them so my question for you
 
05:31:06.350 --> 05:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
is are you aware of the fact that as you
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
celebrate this as you put this as a
 
05:31:10.670 --> 05:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
holiday for New Hampshire You're
 
05:31:12.770 --> 05:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
Expecting second graders to learn about
 
05:31:12.780 --> 05:31:15.830 align:start position:0%
Expecting second graders to learn about
it

05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that that's this is my this is my
 
05:31:22.310 --> 05:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
point I'm just I'm in favor of changing
 
05:31:24.230 --> 05:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
this to indigenous people's day because
 
05:31:27.650 --> 05:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
I think this is really too um terrible a
 
05:31:31.368 --> 05:31:31.378 align:start position:0%
history to teach to young children
 
05:31:35.530 --> 05:31:35.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:38.208 --> 05:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
05:31:39.830 --> 05:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:31:39.840 --> 05:31:57.050 align:start position:0%
any questions
foreign

05:31:57.050 --> 05:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:59.390 --> 05:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
hello how's everyone doing today my name
 
05:32:01.850 --> 05:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
is Anthony Harris
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm po I'm calling in testifying and
 
05:32:08.868 --> 05:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
support of hb155
 
05:32:08.878 --> 05:32:09.830 align:start position:0%
support of hb155
um

05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:12.050 --> 05:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
I remember being in elementary school
 
05:32:14.030 --> 05:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
and they're teaching us about Columbus
 
05:32:17.030 --> 05:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
Day and how he discovered America and he
 
05:32:20.030 --> 05:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
was this great guy they painted him to
 
05:32:23.208 --> 05:32:23.218 align:start position:0%
be this beautiful man and and someone
 
05:32:26.150 --> 05:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
that you can look up to and Inspire to
 
05:32:26.160 --> 05:32:27.230 align:start position:0%
that you can look up to and Inspire to
become

05:32:27.230 --> 05:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
become
 
05:32:29.690 --> 05:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
but then as I get older and I do my own
 
05:32:32.410 --> 05:32:32.420 align:start position:0%
studies and I realize who he really is
 
05:32:35.570 --> 05:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
it makes me look at the American
 
05:32:35.580 --> 05:32:37.390 align:start position:0%
it makes me look at the American
government

05:32:37.390 --> 05:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:32:42.890 --> 05:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
and why would you celebrate someone who
 
05:32:47.090 --> 05:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
was such a horrible person a horrific
 
05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
figure someone that we would call a
 
05:32:51.890 --> 05:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
monster today
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
we would lock up and throw away the key
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
and in some states he will be have the
 
05:33:00.288 --> 05:33:00.298 align:start position:0%
lethal injection for the atrocities that
 
05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
he committed on the people
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
and that would be in any country
 
05:33:10.670 --> 05:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
so if as America being
 
05:33:14.330 --> 05:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
one of the greatest countries on this
 
05:33:14.340 --> 05:33:16.190 align:start position:0%
one of the greatest countries on this
planet

05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
planet
 
05:33:20.750 --> 05:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
why would we want to celebrate this
 
05:33:24.288 --> 05:33:24.298 align:start position:0%
and to teach our kids
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
now we're lying to our kids throughout
 
05:33:30.970 --> 05:33:30.980 align:start position:0%
history and then it's up to us to
 
05:33:34.610 --> 05:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
deprogram them from these lies that the
 
05:33:39.650 --> 05:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:44.330 --> 05:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
I need the ones who controlling this
 
05:33:44.340 --> 05:33:46.490 align:start position:0%
I need the ones who controlling this
bill

05:33:46.490 --> 05:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:33:49.970 --> 05:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
I need you to look and say
 
05:33:53.288 --> 05:33:53.298 align:start position:0%
would you sit down with your
 
05:33:56.570 --> 05:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
granddaughters and your grandsons and
 
05:33:59.570 --> 05:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
would you teach them how wonderful
 
05:34:01.970 --> 05:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
Christopher Columbus is
 
05:34:05.570 --> 05:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
and how you can aspire to become just
 
05:34:09.530 --> 05:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
like him let's celebrate him on this day
 
05:34:12.650 --> 05:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
how would you feel in yourself in your
 
05:34:16.128 --> 05:34:16.138 align:start position:0%
heart and your souls to the god that you
 
05:34:18.590 --> 05:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
pray to
 
05:34:21.350 --> 05:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
do you really feel comfortable
 
05:34:25.368 --> 05:34:25.378 align:start position:0%
not changing this day from Columbus Day
 
05:34:28.610 --> 05:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
to the indigenous people's day
 
05:34:31.850 --> 05:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
ask yourself these questions
 
05:34:33.708 --> 05:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
in yourselves
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
in your own hearts would you teach your
 
05:34:37.920 --> 05:34:38.690 align:start position:0%
in your own hearts would you teach your
children

05:34:38.690 --> 05:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
and your loved ones that this was a
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
horrible God this was a fantastic God
 
05:34:47.150 --> 05:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
and you can model yourself after it
 
05:34:51.470 --> 05:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
if you want then you should put hb50 uh
 
05:34:55.730 --> 05:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
155 you should push this through
 
05:34:58.128 --> 05:34:58.138 align:start position:0%
thank you and have a beautiful day God
 
05:35:00.050 --> 05:35:00.060 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
05:35:17.030 --> 05:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the opportunity
 
05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
to offer testimony this afternoon my
 
05:35:21.708 --> 05:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
name is Carissa Coro I live in Penacook
 
05:35:24.288 --> 05:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
on Stolen Abernathy land and for 12
 
05:35:26.690 --> 05:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
years I taught literature to high school
 
05:35:28.970 --> 05:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
students here our first unit of American
 
05:35:31.850 --> 05:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
literature focused on creation myths and
 
05:35:32.990 --> 05:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
first-hand accounts from early
 
05:35:35.628 --> 05:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
colonizers through these readings my
 
05:35:37.788 --> 05:35:37.798 align:start position:0%
students came to an understanding that
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
the Columbus they have been taught to
 
05:35:41.570 --> 05:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
admire in elementary school for his
 
05:35:43.850 --> 05:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
bravery and perseverance as an explorer
 
05:35:46.730 --> 05:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
was by many accounts including his own a
 
05:35:49.788 --> 05:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
pretty terrible human being in fact as
 
05:35:51.948 --> 05:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
we heard before his actions were so
 
05:35:53.628 --> 05:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
horrific he was returned to Spain and
 
05:35:54.770 --> 05:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
shackles and stripped of his
 
05:35:54.780 --> 05:35:55.970 align:start position:0%
shackles and stripped of his
governorship

05:35:55.970 --> 05:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
governorship
 
05:35:58.190 --> 05:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
some of my students were really upset
 
05:36:00.288 --> 05:36:00.298 align:start position:0%
that they had been essentially lied to
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
which we which you just heard in
 
05:36:01.680 --> 05:36:02.690 align:start position:0%
which we which you just heard in
testimony

05:36:02.690 --> 05:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:36:04.310 --> 05:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
um that we would put someone so terrible
 
05:36:07.128 --> 05:36:07.138 align:start position:0%
on a pedestal in our school district in
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
eighth grade they spent quite a lot of
 
05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
time studying the Holocaust in
 
05:36:12.288 --> 05:36:12.298 align:start position:0%
preparation for the trip to Washington
 
05:36:14.868 --> 05:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
DC and so
 
05:36:17.330 --> 05:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
um they know what genocide looks like in
 
05:36:19.550 --> 05:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
terms of reading about it and they knew
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
that this is what occurred and so their
 
05:36:23.390 --> 05:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
question was why were their elementary
 
05:36:25.490 --> 05:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
teachers do this to them why would they
 
05:36:27.470 --> 05:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
learn about Columbus at all why this
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
holiday and so I don't know um if you
 
05:36:32.690 --> 05:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
know the answer but part of it is
 
05:36:35.030 --> 05:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
connected to historical fiction I'm
 
05:36:37.190 --> 05:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
greatly embellished by Washington Irving
 
05:36:39.650 --> 05:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
and repackaged to elementary school
 
05:36:41.868 --> 05:36:41.878 align:start position:0%
children in our country as a way to
 
05:36:43.310 --> 05:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
celebrate the colonies and U.S
 
05:36:46.070 --> 05:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
Independence there's a lot in Irving's
 
05:36:48.050 --> 05:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
account of Columbus that we still
 
05:36:50.448 --> 05:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
believe today including the ship's names
 
05:36:52.670 --> 05:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
which aren't actually the Nina and the
 
05:36:55.610 --> 05:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
pink death they have other names so this
 
05:36:59.628 --> 05:36:59.638 align:start position:0%
campaign so successful that we still
 
05:37:01.730 --> 05:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
hold these shoes to this day even though
 
05:37:03.830 --> 05:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
we have new truths and we understand
 
05:37:03.840 --> 05:37:05.150 align:start position:0%
we have new truths and we understand
things

05:37:05.150 --> 05:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:37:07.128 --> 05:37:07.138 align:start position:0%
um for me upholding
 
05:37:09.708 --> 05:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
um Irving's Christopher Columbus is like
 
05:37:12.590 --> 05:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
using the musical Hamilton uh to
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
actually teach the events of the
 
05:37:15.470 --> 05:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
American Revolution
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so when folks talk about rewriting
 
05:37:20.690 --> 05:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
history Irving helped to do this
 
05:37:22.970 --> 05:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
um so as a class we inevitably ended up
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
with this question how do you teach
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
elementary students about Columbus so it
 
05:37:28.730 --> 05:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
was really well what would you want your
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
teachers to do so um I gave them a task
 
05:37:33.170 --> 05:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
to create a children's book that was
 
05:37:36.770 --> 05:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
both honest and um that was what they
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
thought was age-appropriate for
 
05:37:41.208 --> 05:37:41.218 align:start position:0%
elementary students and it was difficult
 
05:37:42.770 --> 05:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
um because how do you explain to
 
05:37:45.230 --> 05:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
students elementary students that one of
 
05:37:47.030 --> 05:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
our national holidays celebrates a man
 
05:37:49.250 --> 05:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for starting the
 
05:37:52.010 --> 05:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
largest genocide known to man who is by
 
05:37:54.050 --> 05:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
his own admission and slaves and beings
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
to allowed rates who use dismemberment
 
05:37:58.730 --> 05:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
to control the enslaved who allowed the
 
05:38:01.070 --> 05:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
killing of infants for sport the truth
 
05:38:03.410 --> 05:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
is you can't tell elementary kids this
 
05:38:05.690 --> 05:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
truth and we should not and we should
 
05:38:08.448 --> 05:38:08.458 align:start position:0%
not be lifting this man up as a hero I
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
cannot imagine in 200 years a day where
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
we celebrate Hitler because of some fan
 
05:38:17.208 --> 05:38:17.218 align:start position:0%
fiction story it's really absurd New
 
05:38:18.830 --> 05:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should join other states and
 
05:38:20.570 --> 05:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
municipalities and change in the name of
 
05:38:23.570 --> 05:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
this day doing so will really hurt no
 
05:38:26.990 --> 05:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
one keeping it continue with a lie in a
 
05:38:29.030 --> 05:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
celebration of a man who caused Mass
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
death and destruction and really
 
05:38:32.930 --> 05:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
destruction of culture for his own
 
05:38:36.350 --> 05:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
personal gain not doing so will cause
 
05:38:39.350 --> 05:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
harm it's an annual reminder for the
 
05:38:41.448 --> 05:38:41.458 align:start position:0%
descendants of the survivors of genocide
 
05:38:44.330 --> 05:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
of the ancestors culture story wisdom
 
05:38:47.570 --> 05:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
and homelands lost this day has caused
 
05:38:50.628 --> 05:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
harm annually for a very long time
 
05:38:52.788 --> 05:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
instead we should honor those who have
 
05:38:54.470 --> 05:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
stored this land for thousands of years
 
05:38:56.810 --> 05:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
who influenced our governmental
 
05:38:58.490 --> 05:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
structure that we're participating in
 
05:39:01.010 --> 05:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
today and whose language we use daily in
 
05:39:03.170 --> 05:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
our placings it's time to honor those
 
05:39:05.510 --> 05:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
ancestors that were lost and the bravery
 
05:39:07.850 --> 05:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
and perseverance of peoples who survived
 
05:39:10.368 --> 05:39:10.378 align:start position:0%

of America and they also discovered
 
05:40:04.490 --> 05:40:04.500 align:start position:0%

representative Perez yes thank you for
 
05:41:47.448 --> 05:41:47.458 align:start position:0%

state representative of District 23 and
 
05:41:54.530 --> 05:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
then I'm calling to support this bill
 
05:41:58.730 --> 05:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's a Latina from uh Central America
 
05:42:02.270 --> 05:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
I I don't celebrate Columbus Day and I
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe that we should be
 
05:42:06.470 --> 05:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
celebrating Columbus Day he did such a
 
05:42:09.050 --> 05:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
trick like horrible thanks to our
 
05:42:12.050 --> 05:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
communities and Indigent communities and
 
05:42:15.590 --> 05:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
our countries that I don't believe the
 
05:42:18.170 --> 05:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
US should be celebrating such a horrible
 
05:42:21.170 --> 05:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
person I believe we should encourage
 
05:42:24.830 --> 05:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
people to celebrate Indigent people
 
05:42:27.770 --> 05:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
um we have so many so many people they
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
indigen in my country that they should
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
be celebrated but we don't do that and
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
then I believe the U.S should be taken
 
05:42:36.948 --> 05:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day and celebrate it it's an
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
Indigent day thank you so much for the

05:43:28.490 --> 05:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
supporters in New Hampshire and we
 
05:43:32.208 --> 05:43:32.218 align:start position:0%
support the passage of HB 155 indigenous
 
05:43:33.890 --> 05:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
people's day
 
05:43:36.890 --> 05:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
uh the indigenous people's day is a way
 
05:43:36.900 --> 05:43:39.010 align:start position:0%
uh the indigenous people's day is a way
to

05:43:39.010 --> 05:43:39.020 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:43:43.368 --> 05:43:43.378 align:start position:0%
to make up our relations with indigenous
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
peoples in North America in in New
 
05:43:47.280 --> 05:43:48.350 align:start position:0%
peoples in North America in in New
Hampshire

05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:43:52.490 --> 05:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of the testimony we heard today
 
05:43:55.190 --> 05:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
um kind of talked about indigenous
 
05:43:58.190 --> 05:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
people who lived in the past
 
05:44:00.770 --> 05:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
but and and
 
05:44:03.890 --> 05:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
what I think we are failing to recognize
 
05:44:07.430 --> 05:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
is that the celebration of
 
05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day harms people today and and
 
05:44:14.690 --> 05:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
Indigenous folks today
 
05:44:18.530 --> 05:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
and unlike St Patrick's Day which is a
 
05:44:18.540 --> 05:44:19.390 align:start position:0%
and unlike St Patrick's Day which is a
saint

05:44:19.390 --> 05:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
saint
 
05:44:23.390 --> 05:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh and not a national holiday
 
05:44:28.788 --> 05:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
um Columbus Day is is excludes
 
05:44:30.830 --> 05:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
um people and
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
it it is ex it celebrates the colonizer
 
05:44:37.970 --> 05:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
and it celebrates
 
05:44:41.288 --> 05:44:41.298 align:start position:0%
Columbus specifically who's who's
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
depravity is recorded by himself
 
05:44:49.128 --> 05:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
uh as well as other people who saw it
 
05:44:49.138 --> 05:44:51.590 align:start position:0%
uh as well as other people who saw it
firsthand

05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
firsthand
 
05:44:54.110 --> 05:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
um it he was so barbaric
 
05:44:57.470 --> 05:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
that Columbus's leadership uh was his
 
05:45:00.048 --> 05:45:00.058 align:start position:0%
own cause uh for his dismissal and
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
imprisonment when he returned to Spain
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
on his third trip
 
05:45:08.270 --> 05:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
um Columbus
 
05:45:08.280 --> 05:45:08.990 align:start position:0%
um Columbus
um

05:45:08.990 --> 05:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:11.708 --> 05:45:11.718 align:start position:0%
making the connection that Columbus
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
represents Italian people
 
05:45:15.360 --> 05:45:16.250 align:start position:0%
represents Italian people
um

05:45:16.250 --> 05:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:20.030 --> 05:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
I think is is
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
um it fails to recognize that Italian
 
05:45:26.390 --> 05:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
people don't celebrate him
 
05:45:28.128 --> 05:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
um and that there are certainly many
 
05:45:32.270 --> 05:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
other people of Italian Heritage uh to
 
05:45:32.280 --> 05:45:34.368 align:start position:0%
other people of Italian Heritage uh to
celebrate

05:45:34.368 --> 05:45:34.378 align:start position:0%
celebrate
 
05:45:34.378 --> 05:45:35.390 align:start position:0%
celebrate
um but

05:45:35.390 --> 05:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:45:42.170 --> 05:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
this bill is a way to correct history
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and to recognize the people who have
 
05:45:47.628 --> 05:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
survived after generations of abuse and
 
05:45:50.830 --> 05:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
who are still experiencing that abuse
 
05:45:54.110 --> 05:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
this this is a way to correct history
 
05:45:56.448 --> 05:45:56.458 align:start position:0%
that we knew
 
05:46:00.830 --> 05:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
um and and to see it with clear eyes
 
05:46:00.840 --> 05:46:02.090 align:start position:0%
um and and to see it with clear eyes
um

05:46:02.090 --> 05:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:07.128 --> 05:46:07.138 align:start position:0%
and not to glorify a man's inhumanity
 
05:46:11.270 --> 05:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
um but to glorify people and to
 
05:46:14.090 --> 05:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
celebrate people every all of the
 
05:46:16.368 --> 05:46:16.378 align:start position:0%
indigenous people
 
05:46:20.868 --> 05:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
um and and this because there is a
 
05:46:24.830 --> 05:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
holiday now and we want to re-name a
 
05:46:24.840 --> 05:46:26.448 align:start position:0%
holiday now and we want to re-name a
holiday

05:46:26.448 --> 05:46:26.458 align:start position:0%
holiday
 
05:46:28.490 --> 05:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
um is a way to fix it
 
05:46:31.810 --> 05:46:31.820 align:start position:0%
and and a record to recognize the harm
 
05:46:36.590 --> 05:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
and and to see the people
 
05:46:39.890 --> 05:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
um that we we want to be and to
 
05:46:39.900 --> 05:46:41.690 align:start position:0%
um that we we want to be and to
celebrate

05:46:41.690 --> 05:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
celebrate
 
05:46:46.490 --> 05:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
um the holiday of of people and
 
05:46:52.490 --> 05:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
um there is it as a as another person of
 
05:46:52.500 --> 05:46:53.590 align:start position:0%
um there is it as a as another person of
Italian

05:46:53.590 --> 05:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
Italian
 
05:46:56.990 --> 05:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
Heritage I'm a descendant of Italian
 
05:47:00.048 --> 05:47:00.058 align:start position:0%
Americans too and
 
05:47:02.510 --> 05:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I do recognize that
 
05:47:04.970 --> 05:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
my ancestors
 
05:47:07.610 --> 05:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
um had faced discrimination
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh and faced hardships
 
05:47:13.250 --> 05:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
um for being Catholic and for speaking
 
05:47:15.530 --> 05:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
different languages and looking
 
05:47:15.540 --> 05:47:16.730 align:start position:0%
different languages and looking
different

05:47:16.730 --> 05:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:47:16.740 --> 05:47:19.010 align:start position:0%
different
but

05:47:19.010 --> 05:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:47:19.020 --> 05:47:20.410 align:start position:0%
but
the

05:47:20.410 --> 05:47:20.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:47:24.048 --> 05:47:24.058 align:start position:0%
descendants of Italians today do not
 
05:47:26.330 --> 05:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
face those same hardships
 
05:47:26.340 --> 05:47:28.070 align:start position:0%
face those same hardships
and

05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:47:31.368 --> 05:47:31.378 align:start position:0%
by contrast the Ser the folks who
 
05:47:34.430 --> 05:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
survived Chris Christopher Columbus's
 
05:47:34.440 --> 05:47:36.770 align:start position:0%
survived Chris Christopher Columbus's
genocide

05:47:36.770 --> 05:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
genocide
 
05:47:40.430 --> 05:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
and and the many people of this
 
05:47:43.368 --> 05:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
hemisphere who are here today who are
 
05:47:45.788 --> 05:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
the original
 
05:47:50.330 --> 05:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:53.810 --> 05:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
they are still enduring that
 
05:47:53.820 --> 05:47:55.670 align:start position:0%
they are still enduring that
discrimination

05:47:55.670 --> 05:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
in a way it and and I I would
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
05:48:06.650 --> 05:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
would Grant the relief that my ancestors
 
05:48:08.810 --> 05:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
searched for
 
05:48:11.930 --> 05:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
and it would Grant it to folks who are
 
05:48:15.530 --> 05:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
enduring bigotry and hate today
 
05:48:18.048 --> 05:48:18.058 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be an honor to
 
05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
Grant a national holiday to those who
 
05:48:24.830 --> 05:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
were first Wrong by colonists
 
05:48:29.510 --> 05:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
and to recognize that indigenous people
 
05:48:32.990 --> 05:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
can have can use this important tool on
 
05:48:36.288 --> 05:48:36.298 align:start position:0%
national holiday to lift their stories
 
05:48:38.750 --> 05:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
and history and culture and practices
 
05:48:40.250 --> 05:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
and wisdom
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
for all of us in our country
 
05:48:45.708 --> 05:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
to recognize
 
05:48:49.910 --> 05:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and I I just want to in an effort to
 
05:48:52.190 --> 05:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
recognize repair and heal the wounds of
 
05:48:54.590 --> 05:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
the past New Hampshire Sierra Club
 
05:48:56.750 --> 05:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
supports changing Columbus Day to
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day any other
 
05:49:03.470 --> 05:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
measure it will not meet that goal and
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
we asked the committee to support
 
05:49:10.910 --> 05:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
passage as introduced thank you
 
05:49:13.128 --> 05:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I'd like to
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
mention that changing a national holiday
 
05:49:19.610 --> 05:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
is beyond our power I understand
 
05:49:19.620 --> 05:49:21.230 align:start position:0%
is beyond our power I understand
so

05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:21.240 --> 05:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:49:22.440 --> 05:49:22.450 align:start position:0%

Goffstown I am an Episcopal priest I

serve in Hampstead but I'm also on the
 
05:53:04.970 --> 05:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation Commission for the
 
05:53:07.730 --> 05:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
Episcopal Church of New Hampshire and uh
 
05:53:09.530 --> 05:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
I want to speak on behalf of that
 
05:53:12.048 --> 05:53:12.058 align:start position:0%
commission and also with myself
 
05:53:14.208 --> 05:53:14.218 align:start position:0%
um but wearing the commission hat as the
 
05:53:15.948 --> 05:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
Episcopal priest you know we believe
 
05:53:18.890 --> 05:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
that indigenous people and their history
 
05:53:20.990 --> 05:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
and culture need to be emphasized and
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
that glorifying atrocities committed by
 
05:53:27.170 --> 05:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
Columbus should not be done and you know
 
05:53:28.490 --> 05:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
and some of that was done in the name of
 
05:53:30.170 --> 05:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
God and kind of from the religious
 
05:53:32.090 --> 05:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
perspective that that's not something we
 
05:53:34.010 --> 05:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
want associated with with a God who we
 
05:53:36.110 --> 05:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
believe is love
 
05:53:38.150 --> 05:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and believe that there is a lot that
 
05:53:39.470 --> 05:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
is beautiful and amazing about
 
05:53:41.510 --> 05:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
indigenous culture so many of the place
 
05:53:43.250 --> 05:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
names in New Hampshire come from the
 
05:53:45.470 --> 05:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
Abenaki uh language and there's a rich
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
history to celebrate there and that
 
05:53:50.390 --> 05:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to really learn uh and uh
 
05:53:54.288 --> 05:53:54.298 align:start position:0%
personally I I grew up in Alaska uh with
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of friends who are indigenous
 
05:53:57.410 --> 05:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
there and there's just a great amount of
 
05:53:58.970 --> 05:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
wisdom to learn from indigenous people
 
05:54:02.150 --> 05:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's a rich culture or cultures many
 
05:54:05.270 --> 05:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
cultures uh and personally though I grew
 
05:54:07.368 --> 05:54:07.378 align:start position:0%
up in Alaska I was born in the Northeast
 
05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
and my my family participated in
 
05:54:11.750 --> 05:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
massacring indigenous people in New
 
05:54:14.868 --> 05:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
England and was rewarded for it um the
 
05:54:17.690 --> 05:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
the town of Amherst New Hampshire uh the
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
one of the first Harmons uh was awarded
 
05:54:22.670 --> 05:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh land there for participating in
 
05:54:24.650 --> 05:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
massacring native people in Southern New
 
05:54:27.410 --> 05:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
England uh and it's a it's a dark part
 
05:54:29.150 --> 05:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
of our history that we need to
 
05:54:31.670 --> 05:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
reconsider and celebrating Columbus and
 
05:54:33.770 --> 05:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
celebrating it like other uh speakers
 
05:54:35.150 --> 05:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
have said and just making it like it's
 
05:54:36.170 --> 05:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
something to celebrate and look
 
05:54:37.730 --> 05:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
positively on and not account for these
 
05:54:40.970 --> 05:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
other things is as uh difficult
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'm also irish-american and uh you know
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh St Patrick's Day isn't a a state
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
holiday with people getting it off in
 
05:54:52.128 --> 05:54:52.138 align:start position:0%
the same way and and I you know why why
 
05:54:53.628 --> 05:54:53.638 align:start position:0%
would the Italian Americans get
 
05:54:56.030 --> 05:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
something uh that the the Irish do not
 
05:54:57.770 --> 05:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of a a strange
 
05:55:00.410 --> 05:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
question there and uh from the Irish
 
05:55:02.510 --> 05:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
perspective my family experienced the
 
05:55:04.910 --> 05:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
famine on another wing of it and if we
 
05:55:06.288 --> 05:55:06.298 align:start position:0%
were celebrating people who contributed
 
05:55:08.570 --> 05:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
to the famine my family wouldn't be
 
05:55:11.990 --> 05:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
happy with that uh and so why are we uh
 
05:55:14.150 --> 05:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
lifting up somebody who who like
 
05:55:16.430 --> 05:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
Columbus who did a number of horrendous
 
05:55:18.288 --> 05:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
