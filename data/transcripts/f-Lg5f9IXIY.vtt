please bear with me if I make any small

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Travis Corcoran and I'm the
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill
 
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh the problem in theory New Hampshire
 
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
town government is open and fair in
 
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
practice while sometimes true but is
 
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
also sometimes secretive and biased from
 
00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 align:start position:0%
discussions both with constituents and
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
with multiple lawyers the problem of
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
town boards that engage in
 
00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 align:start position:0%
self-interested governing or casually
 
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
violate citizens rights to open
 
00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
government is a widespread one as a
 
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
citizen I've read dozens of New
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Court cases and rulings
 
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
arising out of 10 boards engaging in
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest and illegal secret
 
00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
meetings or Communications this is out
 
00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
of the hundreds of such cases that exist
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that in turn is a small subset of
 
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
the nappend very few citizens Sue when
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
the rights are violated as lawsuits are
 
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
very expensive tedious and stressful
 
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes Town boards do not merely
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
deliberate an illegal secrecy but
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually purport to make decisions and
 
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
authorize expenditures and secrecy
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
because they know that they act in
 
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
secrecy and that their deliberations and
 
00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 align:start position:0%
votes will never be made public they're
 
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
not constrained by possible
 
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
repercussions if an action taken in a
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
secret meeting is later revealed no one
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
need admit to voting for it was the
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
decision made fives of zero four one
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
three two was there actually a majority
 
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
at all was the vote even held there is
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
no way for anyone but the board members
 
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
themselves to know
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
the current incentives are effectively
 
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
heads I win Tails it's a tie
 
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a provides the citizens May suit
 
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
or illegal of illegally hidden public
 
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
information but there's no remedy if a
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
citizen discovers that actions or
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
decisions had been made in secrecy there
 
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
may be no minutes or votes kept so
 
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
merely mandating the release of
 
00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 align:start position:0%
non-existent records does nothing
 
00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
expenditures authorized outside of legal
 
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
meetings cannot be clawed back judicial
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
actions authorized outside of legal
 
00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
meetings likewise cannot be undone
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
further the incentives for board members
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
suffer from the principal agent problem
 
00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 align:start position:0%
if they conduct a secret meeting and
 
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
authorize expenditures in the very worst
 
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
case for the board members a citizen
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
will sue innocent taxpayers will defend
 
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
the behavior that the board took in
 
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
court and if the board loses then
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
innocent taxpayers will pay a second
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
time paying the plaintiff's legal fees
 
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
the pain of misbehavior under current
 
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
law lands entirely on the innocent and
 
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
those who broke the law suffer zero
 
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.730 align:start position:0%
those who broke the law suffer zero
consequences

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
thus the need for this bill a board
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
member who has a desire to violate the
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
State Constitution and the law may not
 
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
blink at doing so when he knows that he
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
is entirely immune to personal
 
00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
repercussions but is much more likely to
 
00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 align:start position:0%
take the rights of citizens seriously if
 
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
there are possible penalties that would
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
affect them
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
the political option is theoretical but
 
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
now realistic
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
in many towns various boards are
 
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
appointed Not Elected and so are not
 
00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 align:start position:0%
responsive to political process a
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
concerned citizen who is upset that a
 
00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 align:start position:0%
board had you know done such a thing
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
authorized expenditures uh in an illegal
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
secret meeting would first need to
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
propose a warrant article get sufficient
 
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
signatures on the petition win uh at the
 
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
polls with the warrant radical convert
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
the town to elected zoning or planning
 
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
or whatever other board might be
 
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
relevant and then run additional
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
campaigns to place public-minded
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
citizens on the boards and even then
 
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
harms already committed cannot be undone
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
and new board members serve under the
 
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
same flawed incentives as the old board
 
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.070 align:start position:0%
same flawed incentives as the old board
members

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
this bill is complementary to RSA 91a
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a lets citizens attempt to recover
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
illegally classified information this
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
bill provides penalties for actions
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
taken illegally outside of legal
 
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.610 align:start position:0%
taken illegally outside of legal
meetings

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
finally economy this bill address is a
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
real problem experienced by the citizens
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
in towns across New Hampshire is
 
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
narrowly targeted and poses no or
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
minimal costs on towns directly
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
addressed at the state level
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
legislation not at a town level via the
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
political process
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
the best law is one that causes correct
 
00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
Behavior by well-tuned incentives this
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
bill by making board members be aware of
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
and face some small penalties for
 
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
egregious violations of Ethics laws
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
would improve life for countless New
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens reduce the number of
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuits chugged in our overworked
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
courts and thus reduce costs on the
 
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
state and impose minimal or no costs on
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
the town and that's the end of my
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
prepared testimony I've submitted this
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
online but on the drive here I thought
 
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
of one illustrative example to explain
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
uh you know sort of scenario if we have
 
00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
for example a parent who has a child
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
with autism or some learning disability
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
there might be state regulations
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
mandating that the town provides special
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
services and of course you know the town
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
is you know free to not do that in which
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
case citizens would have to go to the
 
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
courts and argue for it and the town
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
government in turn has to decide whether
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
it would defend that lawsuit uh they
 
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
might you know their two options are
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
basically the board of Selectmen can
 
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
meet and say you know yes we just don't
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
want to pay for this this parent is
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
entirely wrong and they are allowed to
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:19.909 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
the issue specifically uh is that in
 
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
such a case the board might decide to
 
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
meet uh and not even call it a meeting
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
they might meet in a coffee house or
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
something and say yes this is uh
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
certainly worth twenty five thousand
 
00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
dollars from the taxpayers to defend
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
against this parent trying to
 
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
legitimately get the you know uh uh
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
rights for their children and if the
 
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
parents you know then win you know
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
finally they get the special classes or
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
the teacher's aid or whatever that state
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
law mandates
 
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
at this point uh the lawsuit is over and
 
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the town would like to
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
know hey we just you know we the town
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
government uh just violated this parents
 
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
rights and then we went to court a
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
second time to try to insist on that
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
violation who exactly made this decision
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
who authorized the expenditure of twenty
 
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars and you know this
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
is the best case scenario there could be
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
multiple cases that might get appealed
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
up to the Supreme Court there might be
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
following cases so you could end in a
 
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
situation where 50 or 75 000 of citizens
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh funds have been spent in you know
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
sort of Defending these uh lawsuits and
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
this is exactly why the political
 
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:21.380 align:start position:0%
process is open you want to know
 
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
retrospectively you know who did this so
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
that we know whether we should vote for
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
these people in office a second time and
 
00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:29.459 align:start position:0%
you also want prospectively the board
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
members to realize hey the votes that I
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
take about spending dollars I will be
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
accountable for it will come out
 
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
eventually and under current law
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
um you know it is wrong to have such a
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
mating and authorize expenditures but
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no way
 
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
um for citizens to do anything about it
 
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
later that's the inclusion of my
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm happy to entertain any
 
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.990 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm happy to entertain any
questions

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you I just have one question if I
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
may on something that you had just
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned and I'm wondering if if I'm
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
confused or if possibly if I heard what
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
you were saying incorrectly
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned uh the example that
 
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned what I'm not playing
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
politics I actually I do work in a
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
school and I when I work in the special
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
education department and it sounded me
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
that the example you were given was a
 
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.430 align:start position:0%
that the example you were given was a
school

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
more of a school situation not an actual
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
local municipality you know we had the
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
school board right it could bless you
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
and then of course we have our Board of
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
Selectmen so was that your intention to
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
discuss extreme situation would I not
 
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
hear correctly that was a good question
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you for it
 
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
um the as I mentioned that was an
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
example that came to me to sort of uh
 
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
concretize it as I was driving and I
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
didn't get the chance um but you know we
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
can supplement that with any other
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
example where uh you know if we wanted
 
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
to make it a zoning issue where a uh
 
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:51.140 align:start position:0%
zoning board of appeals
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
authorizes uh you know a body shop in a
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
residential area
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
um and then the citizen you know wishes
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
to appeal that goes to court and the
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen for example in the
 
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
scenario might have a secret meeting
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and so you know the citizen in the
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
end might win say yes that was an
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
illegal zoning decision it was made
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
improperly and we say you know this was
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
such a slam dunk the BOS you know made a
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
really silly decision to all authorized
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
expenditure of twenty thousand dollars
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
who exactly did that so that I can keep
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
that in mind when I go to the polls
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
thank you I like that example much
 
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
better are there any questions from
 
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.300 align:start position:0%
anybody in the committee
 
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
I notice in the bill
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
um you uh there's a liberal use of the
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
word theft
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I can't quite hear you
 
00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
sorry about that in the in in the bill
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
in the wording of the bill itself you
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
use the word theft pretty liberally
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and in in New Hampshire's theft
 
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:53.579 align:start position:0%
typically has a criminal penalty this
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill has uh civil penalties
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
um curious about your your use of the
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
wording and and why it appears in here
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
um so again I missed the one critical
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
word because a door was opening um but I
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
think I can answer it even having missed
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
the word
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
um this was uh drafted by OLS um and uh
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
it depended on their help I would
 
00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:17.459 align:start position:0%
absolutely be amenable to changing the
 
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
wording to uh make it in keeping uh with
 
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative selig
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm sorry that I I
 
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
apologize that I'm going to phrase this
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
awkwardly I'm still trying to formulate
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
how to make this make sense so if I
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly if
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
um for example
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
Joe the plumber
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
um goes to the planning board and asks
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
them to create a legal zone for him
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
within his district to rezone his house
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
so that he can have his Plumbing trucks
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
all be parked there uh where it would
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
not otherwise be and they approve it and
 
00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
then his next door neighbor
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
um goes to the you know go sues the
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
planning board for approving that
 
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.710 align:start position:0%
planning board for approving that
decision

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.310 align:start position:0%
decision
um

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
and the planning board then hires an
 
00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
is it is it your premise that that's
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
theft that they're I'm just trying to
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
make sense of I I think I understand the
 
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
question I can speak to it
 
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
um so so that was excellent that's a
 
00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
perfect example uh currently it is uh
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely illegal and in in under this
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill would absolutely continue to be
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
legal that the uh Board of Selectmen
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
would authorize
 
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
um a defense of that and win or lose
 
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's fine and that would not be made
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
theft under this bill
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
um you know it is entirely reasonable
 
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
that a board might say hey we acted in
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
good faith this is our understanding of
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
the law we consulted with an attorney
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
the attorney said yes that is reasonable
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
this law specifically addresses
 
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
um if the board of Selectmen instead of
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
doing this properly going into a closed
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
meeting discussing it
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
um you know perhaps taking advice from
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
an attorney and then voting four to one
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
um saying yes let's defend this lawsuit
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh that is currently legal and would
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
remain legal the scenario that this bill
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
addresses is when the board of Selectmen
 
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
meets at one selectman's house uh not
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
recorded not an official meeting
 
00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:17.339 align:start position:0%
um and says you know we need to have the
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
secret meeting because we all know
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
what's wrong
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
um you know we all know that this
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
defense is really iffy it's a Hail Mary
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
pass probably the guy's gonna win but
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
you know Joe the plumber is my cousin
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
he's your you know high school friend
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
Etc let's do this solid for him at least
 
00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
show that we're trying
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
um and you know then if we lose you know
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh at least no one will know that we
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
voted for uh this uh expenditure
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
recognize for follow-up thank you so my
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
understanding of the way Town ordinances
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire law is and again I'm
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
not an attorney and I'm also new to all
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
of this but
 
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
is that secret meetings are actually
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
explicitly prohibited by law and Statute
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
in which case they would be acting
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
outside the purview of their committee
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
which would not then give them
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
protection so I still don't understand
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
why this would be necessary it seems to
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
me to be I'm just trying to sorry I
 
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
think that's an excellent question um
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
and and that question speaks to exactly
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
um it is illegal uh to have a secret
 
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
um it is illegal uh to have a secret
meeting

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
um but the question is what are the
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
incentives on the board um if you know
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
let's say that they choose to have that
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
secret meeting you know they twist their
 
00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:28.019 align:start position:0%
wax mustaches and say yes we're all you
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
know gathered together to do something
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
villainous here we know we're breaking
 
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
um but still we all agree that uh you
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
know let's have the secret meeting let's
 
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
authorize the town attorney uh let's pay
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to do Joe the plumber
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
this a salad
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
um now what let's say that happens and a
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
check is written it's handed to the
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
attorney the case goes to court the town
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
either wins or lose
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
um and then a citizen you know says hey
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
uh I have read RSA 91a I know that
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
closed meetings
 
00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
um are legal especially in this
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
particular case but that minutes and
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
vote totals must be kept and those
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
minutes and vote totals must be released
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
at the conclusion of the lawsuit so
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
great the lawsuit is over I would like
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
to see so that I can vote uh for you
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
know people who are making good
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
decisions and vote against people who
 
00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:16.019 align:start position:0%
are making bad decisions I would like to
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
see that vote total please please show
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
me the minutes
 
00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:21.959 align:start position:0%
and the answer is you know LOL there are
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
no minutes there's no vote total uh you
 
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
don't get to know what we did at that uh
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
illegal meeting
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
um the only remedy under current law is
 
00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:33.079 align:start position:0%
that a citizen can sue under RSA 91a
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
they can you know reach into their own
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
pocket they can pull out ten or twenty
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars they can go to court
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
and they can win at which point the
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
judge will say uh board that had this
 
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
illegal meeting please hand over minutes
 
00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:47.579 align:start position:0%
if any of your decision
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh minutes if any of the meeting
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
and the board says okay we understand
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
but there were no minutes at this point
 
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
the money of the taxpayer money has
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
already been spent the lawsuit has
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
already taken place uh the citizen who
 
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
had to you know prosecute the underlying
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh you know is out of pocket so
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
um just because something is illegal
 
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that there's any incentives
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
to stop the board from doing it and
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what this is attempting
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
um I was under the impression that
 
00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
um vote totals and minutes weren't kept
 
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
in non-public sessions is that the case
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
um that is not my understanding
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
um I believe and I don't have the Clause
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
at hand right now
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
um but there is a clause in RSA 91a it's
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
you know the third or fourth paragraph
 
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
and it specifically says that in the
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
case of
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
close meetings for the purpose of
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
Defending a lawsuit so we might both be
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
right in different subsections so for
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
example if it's a closed meeting to
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
decide you know what should we do about
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
the police chief uh you know we think
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
that he's hitting on employees
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
um you know I I'm not sure if minutes
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
and votes are kept for that but I am
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
quite convinced uh that they are kept
 
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
for decisions about engaging in lawsuits
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
and it is explicitly the case that they
 
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
must be released after the conclusion of
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
so to answer that they they keep very
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
very vague minutes for any kind of
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
non-public and I I do believe that they
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
do keep they do keep votes and then in
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
the event that they're ever unsealed
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
then they have the information but
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
they're very very big
 
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so hey I just want to stand
 
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
corrected in the in the bill the bill
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
references RSA 63711
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
um uh and that specific
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
um uh part of it of the applicable Parts
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of theft by a public
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
servant and subject to the penalties in
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
RSA 637-11
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
for an expense larger than fifteen
 
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:54.860 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars that's a class B felony
 
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
so it is not just a civil issue it is a
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
criminal issue
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
um and for an offense where the sum
 
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:06.140 align:start position:0%
total is larger than a thousand dollars
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's a Class A misdemeanor
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
I guess my question for you is is uh
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
do you think we should be criminalizing
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
um the behavior that this Behavior
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
arises to number one to a to a criminal
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
behavior and do you think that this
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
penalty is appropriate for volunteers
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
that is uh an excellent question
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh I would say that on the one
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
hand it's volunteers but on the other
 
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
hand uh it's a paid position
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
um so but uh the intent here was not
 
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
specific penalties
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
um you know in general uh we set
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
incentives not because or penalties not
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
because we want to collect them but
 
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
because we want people to be aware that
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
there is a hard line that they shouldn't
 
00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
cross so you know for example we had a
 
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
road that doesn't have a speed limit on
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
it we might choose to put a you know 50
 
00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
mile an hour speed limit there not
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
because we are hoping to get lots of
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
fines but just to make aware of what the
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
boundaries are and you know then ideally
 
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
we would hope that we never once catch
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
anyone bringing it that's the goal the
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
goal is not to punish people
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know in in my ideal version
 
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
this bill would be passed and then it
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
would never actually result in anything
 
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
speaking specifically to the size of the
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
penalties much of what I'm aiming for
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
could be accomplished just as well with
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
a 500 penalty as a you know class B
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
felony or something
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
um I uh again depended on OLS and
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
probably didn't express my intent
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
crisply to them I would be happy to
 
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
amend this and I would love to hear any
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
feedback about what would seem to be an
 
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of penalty that
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
expresses the intent of the law and the
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
importance of having open and responsive
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
government without you know certainly
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
holding 10 years in jail or 50 000 fine
 
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
over somebody
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
I apologize for being late but you can
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
see the reasons why out the window
 
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
I have some confusion it sounds like
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
there may be criminal penalties
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
but it looks like the entire section of
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
section two is that any citizen can take
 
00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:21.299 align:start position:0%
action and you may have said this before
 
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
I came in and I apologize if you did
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
to challenge uh take it it sounds like
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
they take it to court and then get some
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
kind of remuneration for that and and
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
whatever so so at least partially even
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
though it falls under something that has
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
a criminal penalty this is like one of
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
some of the laws that have recently be
 
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
passed that that takes this kind of
 
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
thing out of the purview of the courts
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
and puts it into the purview of any
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
private citizen that wants to take a
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
civil action uh that's an excellent
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
question correct in that yeah that's an
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
excellent point and I again played I'm
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
an engineer not a lawyer so I think that
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is something that definitely needs
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
to be tidied up via Amendment the intent
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
to have civil action uh is definitely on
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
there um so that you know citizens just
 
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
as with RSA 91a can push for uh you know
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
some sort of resolution without having
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
to depend on third parties but I
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
entirely understand that uh it is not
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
the purview of private citizens to uh
 
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
you know push for criminal penalties
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and so I would like to speak to oh
 
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
less and come up with something that
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
resolves that and uh
 
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up recognize
 
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and in in the first part of it it
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
says so it's a person who authorizes or
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
attempts to authorize a defense
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if then it says to
 
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
pay they have to pay for it or or not
 
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I guess if you have if does the
 
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299 align:start position:0%
person have to be authorized
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
the person who does the deed of talking
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
about or raise or discussing it looks
 
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
like even a defense
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
or something
uh

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just confused whether whether that
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
person has to be authorized in the
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
organization that he's in to be able to
 
00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
make payments or or does that even
 
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
factor in at all uh that is a great
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you for it uh and I
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
think that this is another thing that I
 
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
need to work with ol us on and uh
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
clarify what the appropriate approach
 
00:23:27.169 --> 00:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
so I I came in late in
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
you don't want them to defend
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
a member of the town or no uh that's a
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
great question
 
00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:42.890 align:start position:0%
great question
um

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
under current law and under uh the
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
proposal of this bill it is absolutely
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
legal for a town to defend against any
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and they can deliberate on it
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
they can choose to defend they can
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
choose not to defend they can choose to
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
defend to The Bitter End defending it
 
00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
you know appeal after appeal all the way
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
um that is absolutely reasonable for a
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
town to do
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and would remain legal the uh problem
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
that this addresses is that sometimes
 
00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
towns know that they have a bit of a
 
00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299 align:start position:0%
stinker of a case and the individual
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
board members who uh are in the position
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
of authorizing or not authorizing a
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
defense you know might want to spend
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
some money to show a buddy that they're
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
collaborating with hey I've got your
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
back we're going to fight this to The
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
Bitter End but they might not want that
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
to be public later you know the Best of
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
Both Worlds where they're doing one
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
thing but uh if citizens later say hey
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
we spent twenty five thousand dollars uh
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
authorizing this insane thing we got
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
slapped down by the judge we the town
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
who's behind this because when I go to
 
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
the polls in March I want to make sure
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
that I'm you know electing Selectmen who
 
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:51.059 align:start position:0%
are responsible stewards of our tax
 
00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:52.070 align:start position:0%
are responsible stewards of our tax
dollars

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
um once a lawsuit is concluded the
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
deliberations about defending that
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and authorizing the expenditure
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
are public information however it is
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
possible for board members to violate
 
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
that law they can say Hey you know let's
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
not meet at Town Hall let's not turn the
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
cameras on let's all meet in my sun room
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
and figure out what we're going to do
 
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
about this we know we're going to lose
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
but at least Joe the plumber who's my
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
cousin and your high school buddy he'll
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
know that we did everything we could and
 
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
you know sure it's going to cost twenty
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars but it's not like
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to pay that right
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
now that can happen and then the lawsuit
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
loses and then the citizen who was
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
trying to you know get his uh child you
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
know special remedies or there's a
 
00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:33.539 align:start position:0%
zoning dispute or you know Contracting
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
says great I want to know who spent that
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
money and the answer is oh there are no
 
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
records we did it in a secret meeting
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
and you can say Okay RSA 91a says that I
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
can get the details of that and the
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
answer is we didn't keep any notes
 
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
um and then he says you know and also I
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
spent to prosecute this lawsuit against
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
you I spent 25 000 what happens do I get
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
that money back and the answer is nope
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's done we just had a secret meeting
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
we authorized expenditures in this
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
illegal secret meeting and there's
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
nothing a citizen can do about it you
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
can't even vote against us next time
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
because you don't know who did it
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
but in that example
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
um couldn't the citizen file a complaint
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
that the right to know law was violated
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
in that case absolutely and uh this was
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
a question that I think representative
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
selig asked earlier he could file a
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
complaint and
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
what under current law what happens with
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
that complaint so first of all you don't
 
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
file a complaint under RSA 91a you
 
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
launch a lawsuit under 91a you can then
 
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
go to court the citizen can reach into
 
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
his own pocket spend fifteen thousand
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
dollars the judge can say yes clearly uh
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
there should have been minutes there
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
should have been a vote recorded it
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
should now be publicized so you know
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
Board of selectment or planning board
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
please publicize those minutes tell this
 
00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
citizen what he wants to know tell him
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
who voted for that expenditure and the
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
board you know Smiles at Cheshire Cat
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
grin and says oh there are no notes
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
and the judge says okay well I did what
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
I could and then the citizen asks judge
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know I spent twenty thousand dollars
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
to you know deal with the zoning issue
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever went to court
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
um they had a secret meeting they uh
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
expended uh taxpayer funds in this
 
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
secret meeting now there's absolutely
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
nothing they're saying they don't know
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
who did it that money doesn't go back to
 
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers what do I get judged what
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
do the taxpayers get and the judge says
 
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
you know I'm sorry citizen under RSA 91a
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
everything that could be done has been
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
done we asked them to reveal minutes and
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
they told us there are no minutes that's
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
the end of it
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
I understand the the hypothetical
 
00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:48.049 align:start position:0%
I understand the the hypothetical
situation

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
um what I'm also curious about is
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
whether there's actually any data on how
 
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
often this happens that's an excellent
 
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.390 align:start position:0%
often this happens that's an excellent
question

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
um I have you know knowledge of a couple
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
of times it has happened locally and
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that motivated
 
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
me to run for the house
 
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
um I have done a lot of lay research
 
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
reading Supreme Court New Hampshire
 
00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh cases and I've spoken
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
to local attorneys
 
00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
um and the answer is oh yes stuff like
 
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
this happens but you know when someone
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
says yes this happens and yeah I had a
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
client up in you know Milford or you
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
know in Henniker or something that's
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
happened to that's an anecdote it's true
 
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
um but it's not hard data and uh you
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
know I'm an engineer so I always like
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
hard data much more than a story you
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
know a friend told me that his cousin
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know had this happen so I wanted to
 
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
walk in here with a list of here 73
 
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:40.100 align:start position:0%
times that this has happened
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh there does not seem to
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
be an easy way to get hard numbers on
 
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.710 align:start position:0%
be an easy way to get hard numbers on
that

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.450 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
quick question I thought you had to come
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
out of non-public session and for a vote
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
I didn't think you could take a vote in
 
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
non-public session
 
00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's the case or not
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
um but in either case we are we're
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
getting to the exact same thing uh
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
apparently you know there's the
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
situation whether you're allowed to or
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
not you get into a situation where votes
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
are taken in things that are neither
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
public sessions nor non-public sessions
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
they are illegal meetings and
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
expenditures are authorized in those
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
meetings so you know uh if your
 
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
statement is wait that doesn't sound
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
right to me I don't think they're
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that I entirely agree with
 
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.029 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that I entirely agree with
you

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
represent the Senate of Roy
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
so is he is it your position that while
 
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.950 align:start position:0%
so is he is it your position that while
91a

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
91a
 
00:29:48.289 --> 00:29:48.299 align:start position:0%
exists and dictates what they may or may
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
not do it has no teeth if they decide
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
we're just not going to follow that
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question uh it has
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
two or three teeth
 
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
um and so the teeth specifically that it
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
has is
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
um as a citizen you can sue and say hey
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
there may or may not be records and
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to hide them from me
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
please give me those records and if you
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
go through the laborious and expensive
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
and stressful process and if you win you
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
can get the records
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't help so here's you know
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
one tooth that is missing it doesn't
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
help if there are no records and here's
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
the second thing if actions were
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
authorized there is no way to undo those
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
actions so if you know to make up a
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
crazy thing if there was a taking we
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
decided that we wanted this Farmer's
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
field to put in a football uh field
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
instead and we did that
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and then the farmer sued and we went
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
to court and everything and we want to
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
know you know who is behind all of this
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
and the answer is oh we were very
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
careful to not take any records so great
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
you don't get your records and second
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
the farmer says well can I have my field
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
back now the answer is no that's done
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
well okay can I at least have my you
 
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
know forty thousand dollars in legal
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
fees back now nope that's spent can the
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
citizens have the thirty thousand
 
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
dollars that they uh spent or um and the
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
answer is nope that's spent as well so
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh there was a question earlier
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
about do we really want to criminalize
 
00:31:06.169 --> 00:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
and make a class B felony out of uh
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
things and and I agree to that and uh we
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
really you know don't want to have
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
massive penalties I would not want a law
 
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
that's going to let some volunteer who
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
maybe got in a little over their head
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
suddenly is you know paying a hundred
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in fines
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
um but I think that by having uh some
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
you know I don't want to quite say token
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
but you know uh relatively small fine to
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
make it clear that this is a boundary
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
that you know if you want to take Farmer
 
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:30.299 align:start position:0%
Joe's field for a parking lot do it on
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
the up and up you know have the uh
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
Integrity to at least have your vote
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
recorded in a closed meeting so that
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
when it's all done later that'll come
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
out and you know you should be proud of
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
and defend your vote on that so this is
 
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.549 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and and pardon me for not having um
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
had time to read it through yet I I too
 
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit late
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
is there any way that the penalties you
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
are proposing would fall back on the
 
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the intent here is
 
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
specifically not it is very specifically
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
because that's the problem it tries to
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
solve and so you know I would hate to
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
say hey the taxpayers are uh getting a
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
raw deal let's give them a second Raw
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
Deal to make it better
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so uh the intent is that this is
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
um a an action committed by an
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
individual who serves on a board and the
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
consequences should fall on that there
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
was uh like I said one question about
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
the size of the penalties and that's
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
certainly something I need to address
 
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
and there was another excellent question
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
about sort of a weird mismatch between
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
civil and criminal and that also needs
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
to be addressed but um as I work with
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
OLS uh I will certainly keep as the core
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
issue you know something you and I both
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
agree on apparently uh that these should
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:51.059 align:start position:0%
so I the the last thing I'd like to ask
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
you about is
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
what what is an example of or or an
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
explanation of who the who the people
 
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
are it sounds like there are two or more
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
people who are yeah two or more people
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
who who are on some legislative
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
organization and they get together and
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
there's three of them
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
and two of them say I think we ought to
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
start a lawsuit in the third one says no
 
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
and they say well we took a vote and
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead with this
 
00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
lawsuit so they go ahead with a lawsuit
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether they win it or
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
lose it I'm not sure I heard that but
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
but but then what happens the the uh the
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
money that comes from the municipality
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
has to be in my opinion has to be voted
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
on by the municipality I don't know how
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
they how they wiggle their way into a
 
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
non-session or whatever how did they do
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
that in right so this is an excellent
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
question someone else asked a question
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the similar vein uh you know and
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
the question was effectively you know
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
hey that's illegal they can't do that so
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
what is it you know specifically that
 
00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
you're trying to address with us and and
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
I'm agreeing with you yes that's exactly
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
correct that um a bunch of board of
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
Selectmen for example meeting at a
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
coffee house or in someone's sun room
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
um and having a off the Record uh
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
discussion and vote that is neither in a
 
00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:14.060 align:start position:0%
uh open meeting nor in a closed meeting
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
cannot authorize the expenditure of
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds to defend against a
 
00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
lawsuit they can't do it the law says
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
they can't do it but the question is say
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
they do it anyway and the town attorney
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
says okay you know I I got the phone
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
call from the head of the BOS the head
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
of the BOS says that they want me to
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
defend the planning boards or the zoning
 
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
boards decision to put in a oil refinery
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a you know um you know
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
park or whatever
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
um you know that shouldn't happen we
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree uh and yet um it's
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
something that can happen there's you
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
know we've got laws but there's no you
 
00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.099 align:start position:0%
know law of physics that stops these
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
people from doing it that phone call
 
00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
from being made that check from being
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
signed so the question is when such a
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
sequence of events happens uh what
 
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
remedy do citizens have afterwards and
 
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:09.740 align:start position:0%
just follow up
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
and my follow-up would be they can't
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
authorize it in the private they can't
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
authorize it in the off-site non-public
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
session so they have to get into and not
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
they'd have to get into a non-public
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
session to do that to get the
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
authorization they could they couldn't
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
just make the phone call from their
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
meeting at work I understand the
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
question and I'm not even sure it's
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
criminal because now it's the solution
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
apparently from the bill is that it's
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
it's a civil thing that anybody can
 
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
whether whether or not and you might
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
want to clarify this portion of it does
 
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
the person can anybody in the state of
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who just thinks it's a bad
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
idea get into civil court with this
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
because it says anybody can do that or
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
maybe am I misreading that
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
um that was excellent I believe there's
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
two questions there the first question
 
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.810 align:start position:0%
two questions there the first question
sorry

00:35:58.810 --> 00:35:58.820 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
the first question was
 
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.050 align:start position:0%
the first question was
um

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
the first was basically a statement and
 
00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:11.579 align:start position:0%
the statement was but current law does
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
not allow a POS
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
um to meet and without going into either
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
open or closed session authorize
 
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
expenditure of funds for the defense of
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit I 100 agree with you current
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
law does not authorize that to happen
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
current law also doesn't authorize you
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
know Murder or burglary and yet those
 
00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:31.619 align:start position:0%
things happen so the question is when an
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
illegal action like that happens what is
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
the remedy and this bill seeks to
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
provide a remedy for a thing that should
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
never happen because it's illegal but a
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
thing that does happen the second
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
question was who does this bill
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
authorize to push for enforcement and
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
your observation was that it says uh I'm
 
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
not sure what line number but something
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know any person that is intentional
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
and that is part of it so that you know
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh if you know Joe the plumber was an
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
example earlier if Joe the plumber has a
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
back room deal he is you know get some
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
spot zoning so they can park trucks in
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
the middle of a residential area
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
um the zoning board gives him you know
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
spot zoning approval even though spot
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
zoning has been illegal The Neighbor
 
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
Next Door you know uh goes through the
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
political process in the town the BOS
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
says you know we've heard your
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
objections but we don't care the citizen
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
then sues the BOS meets in secret
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
session and authorized expenditure of
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to defend a clearly
 
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
losing lawsuit
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and then after it's all over
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
um you know under this bill there's the
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
The Proposal of what can a citizen do
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
um to you know enforce the fact that the
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
BOS should not be having secret meetings
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
and illegally authorizing expenditures
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
and so the any person could speak to the
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
one citizen who originally filed uh the
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
lawsuit it could speak to another
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
citizen who is like-minded and lives on
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
the other side of Joe the plumber it
 
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
good Etc
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from the
 
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.690 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from the
committee

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%

my my testimony here um I uh
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here to
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill 302 a bill that
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
make uh constitutional training uh more
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
more stringent and uh and uh you know a
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
better a better
 
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
better training for for our police
 
00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.930 align:start position:0%
better training for for our police
officers

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
um I I thought about this idea uh a
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago a year and a half
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
ago or so while we were at uh the
 
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
Bedford state house uh
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
we uh we we voted on a bill to uh to
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
eliminate qualified immunity for our law
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
enforcement and uh you know coming from
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
a law enforcement family I I knew that
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
wasn't a good idea
 
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want I don't want our
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
offices out there uh second guessing
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
every move they make
 
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
but anyway I did I went to a seminar and
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know it was about qualified
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
immunity and it was mostly all people
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
that wanted to get rid of it uh you know
 
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
the ACLU lawyers and stuff and uh that
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
one of their one of their main
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
objections was the lack of
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional knowledge by our police
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
officers you know these are the guys
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
that are here to enforce the
 
00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339 align:start position:0%
Constitution and uh you know they felt
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
that uh you know that they they didn't
 
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
have enough training in it so I put this
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
bill together I I spoke to uh to John
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
cipa about a year ago about it and he
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
and I just spoke and uh you know uh we
 
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh we we both kind of agree that you
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
know that you know constitutional
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
training for for law enforcement is a
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
good idea and um you know the the the uh
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
the difference of opinion that we have
 
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
and I'm not uh I wouldn't object to uh
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
to knocking down the the eight hours
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
that I have here uh down a six or
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
whatever uh you know whatever would be
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate but we just need better
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
training and um you know it's it's to
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
fend off the uh the attack on on
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity uh is the the reason
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
I put this together
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
and uh that would be about it
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um I'll take the
 
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
first question have you conferred with
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
um with um director skippa and asked
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
that they do have constitutional uh law
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
and training as part of their Academy
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
correct yes they do and uh you know the
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the opinion of uh those
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
at that seminar and uh you know direct
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
us on a skipper doesn't uh doesn't seem
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
to be too averse to you know adding a
 
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
little more uh and uh you know we've
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
just got to do better uh you know uh
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
We've uh I was just talking to him about
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
an instance uh my brother
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we both Drive limos and uh two
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning he was pulled
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
over uh a a cop pulled up behind him
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
with the bright lights on and all the
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
rest and blinding them and so he just
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
pulled over and to let him buy didn't
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
know he was a cop and uh you know he got
 
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
read the riot act and you know have you
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
been drinking you're all over the road
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
well you know when you when you've got
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
bright lights shining in your eyes uh
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
you tend to do that and uh you know my
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
my brother my brother been sober for 25
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
five years at the time but anyway you
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
know it was a you know it's something
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't have happened and um you
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
know uh the the if the officer had more
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
training and and stuff maybe of
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I've talked to other other
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
guys I drive with and uh that they have
 
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
the same problems in some of the small
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
towns uh you know so uh you know if we
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
have some some better constitutional
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
training you know for the people that
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
are there to enforce the Constitution uh
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
I think New Hampshire would be a better
 
00:54:04.619 --> 00:54:05.809 align:start position:0%
I think New Hampshire would be a better
place

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
um the Constitution is a really big
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
document and uh eight hours isn't a heck
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
of a lot of time
 
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:20.930 align:start position:0%
of a lot of time
um

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
are there particular areas of focus you
 
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
would like to see the training
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
um zero in on
 
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question absolutely uh
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's written here the Bill of
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
Rights okay uh the the I don't think
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
police officers need to know Commerce
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
law and election law and stuff let you
 
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
know let's let's focus on the Bill of
 
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:43.630 align:start position:0%
know let's let's focus on the Bill of
Rights

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.010 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
um specifically if you're talking about
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights I mean that's pretty
 
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.490 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights I mean that's pretty
short

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
short
 
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
um piece of it right
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
um and if there's already training I'm
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
just wondering what kind of feedback you
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
got as far as
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
um is it is it the training that's
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
lacking or is it kind of you know the
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
testing the the demonstration of of that
 
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.430 align:start position:0%
testing the the demonstration of of that
knowledge

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question it's a good
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
question huh well
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
I guess it wouldn't be very fair to uh
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
to to test somebody on something that
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
they haven't been trained on so uh you
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
know that the training is uh is
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
necessary uh you know I um
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
you know it'd be more thorough some some
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
might have enough to get through a test
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
and uh you know and score maybe a 70 but
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
I I'd like our law enforcement to be
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
able to score you know 95 to 100 and if
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
they have the training they can
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
thank you I think at this point um it
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
would probably be best to hear from
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
director Skipper thank you very much for
 
00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:45.020 align:start position:0%
um bringing this bill oh I'm sorry
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely just if it's I think we
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much know what he knows so
 
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
I I was just trying to understand the
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
connection to qualified immunity
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and your bill I I misunderstood your
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
your connection between those I'm really
 
00:55:59.579 --> 00:56:01.870 align:start position:0%
your connection between those I'm really
sorry

00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
there is a push to get rid of qualified
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
immunity do you understand what
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity is okay uh there's a
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
there's a push we did have a bill I'm
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
not sure if it was last year the year
 
00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:13.370 align:start position:0%
not sure if it was last year the year
before

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.109 align:start position:0%
before
um

00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
it was a close vote and um you know I I
 
00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
think it'd be disastrous for law
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement it'd be disaster disasters
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
represent scitec I don't want to
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
protract this but you may be headed in
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction here's why I can't
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
imagine a patrolman saying to his
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
Sergeant you've just asked me to do
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
something unconstitutional because I've
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
just read this I had a training I just
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
that's not how line command works in the
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
police department I have some experience
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
with that would you comment on that what
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
what how can how can you tell your your
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant no you're wrong that's what
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
the courts are for
 
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
if I was a police officer thanks for the
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
question if I was a police officer and I
 
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:06.020 align:start position:0%
was being asked to do something
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh I'd certainly have a
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
record of it and uh if it's a lieutenant
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'd ask a captain
 
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I think the answer to that
 
00:57:19.609 --> 00:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
question is not is not part of this bill
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
this is the training part as far as how
 
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
the Departments handle that I think is
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%

I'm the director of New Hampshire police
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
standards and training we are the sole
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
source for recruit training here for
 
00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
every single law enforcement agent here
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and we
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
also serve as the primary source for
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
incumbent or in-service police training
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire as
 
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.270 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire as
well

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your uh you're allowing
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
me to uh come and just share uh some of
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
my thoughts on this particular Bill uh
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
and and Mr chair I would ask if I uh
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
pass something along to this committee
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
does it become a public record it does
 
00:58:30.049 --> 00:58:30.059 align:start position:0%
okay uh and so in that case I will not
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
pass the document around only because it
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
contains uh test information and a
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
facilitator guide uh for the actual
 
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
block of instruction but I hold here uh
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
our uh
 
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
60 uh check that 12 hour class on
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
constitutional law which is delivered at
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
every recruit Training Academy that we
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
deliver in New Hampshire
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh this this was compiled and built by
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
one of my training Specialists who is a
 
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh an attorney as well as a certified
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
police officer
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
the uh this lesson uh is not only
 
00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
lecture based but also scenario based
 
00:59:17.819 --> 00:59:19.789 align:start position:0%
lecture based but also scenario based
yes

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
if I could I I thought your intention
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
was to give a handout if you want to
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
just pass that around to let folks look
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
at it it doesn't become part of the
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
I would ask every member if you have an
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at the table of
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
contents because it clearly sets forth
 
00:59:59.890 --> 00:59:59.900 align:start position:0%
each module of the entire lesson plan uh
 
01:00:02.109 --> 01:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
this lesson plan
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
speaks directly to those constitutional
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
aspects that a law enforcement officer
 
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
is going to need to know and and to
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative loves uh position there
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
are there are portions of these
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
documents that are just not relevant to
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh and so we concentrate
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
our efforts on those areas that are
 
01:00:29.289 --> 01:00:29.299 align:start position:0%
specific to law enforcement activities
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
we we speak not only to the Federal
 
01:00:35.049 --> 01:00:35.059 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the state constitution
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh certainly Bill of Rights but we also
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
talk about historical data as well and
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
and some of the um
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh just human rights that came before
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
any Constitution did we really want to
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
build out a strong foundation with these
 
01:00:56.329 --> 01:00:56.339 align:start position:0%
recruits with regard to those aspects of
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
constitutional law that they're going to
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
be working with every single day that
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
they go out on the street
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
I would like to share with you that
 
01:01:06.119 --> 01:01:06.829 align:start position:0%
I would like to share with you that
um

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
I am extremely proud of this work
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
product that's going around the table
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
and in fact next month I have been
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
invited to participate in a national
 
01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:16.849 align:start position:0%
invited to participate in a national
study

01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:01:19.569 --> 01:01:19.579 align:start position:0%
uh for uh
 
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
directors of law enforcement standards
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
and training internationally uh where I
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be attending a program on
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
the development of best practice for
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
teaching constitutional and procedural
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
Justice that will lay out uh really kind
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
of a framework on a national level with
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
regard to teaching the Constitution to
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
new police recruits and I've already
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
forwarded this document to the committee
 
01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:54.059 align:start position:0%
as we prepare to to have these
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
discussions and already I've received a
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of uh really accolades
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
to pass along to the person that
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
developed this this is I in my opinion
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
is serves as a as an example Nationwide
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
on how we should be teaching
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
constitutional law to to recruit
 
01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:16.130 align:start position:0%
constitutional law to to recruit
officers

01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
it's also important to understand that
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
particularly with teaching adults
 
01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
lecture is not the best way to get the
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
point across you really want to create
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
opportunities where you give adults fact
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
patterns and let them work through it
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
themselves have that that open
 
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.549 align:start position:0%
themselves have that that open
discussion

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
try to come to the appropriate decision
 
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
in a safe environment right through
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
scenario training in group group
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
projects those laminated cards that are
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
going to follow that lesson plan and
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
facilitators guide are actual scenarios
 
01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:52.460 align:start position:0%
that we use at the Academy to teach
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
those recruits as they go through this
 
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.030 align:start position:0%
those recruits as they go through this
program

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
I would look forward to I would welcome
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work with uh
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative love and really anybody
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
in this state quite frankly
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
if there is a concern that we are not
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
providing the best instruction that we
 
01:03:16.089 --> 01:03:16.099 align:start position:0%
can provide to our police officers
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
particularly with regard to
 
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
constitutional law I stand ready to work
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
with anyone and I I was lucky enough to
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with representative
 
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
love before testimony began I I
 
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
certainly would look forward to sitting
 
01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
down and working with him to see
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh maybe the shortcomings that he he
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
might have in his mind uh whether we are
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
addressing those shortcomings that that
 
01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
he believes exists uh and if they do
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
exist then let us work to uh to make a
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
phenomenal lesson plan even better quite
 
01:03:49.799 --> 01:03:51.410 align:start position:0%
phenomenal lesson plan even better quite
frankly

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.270 align:start position:0%
frankly
um

01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
my other concern is it's important to
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
teach the content
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
hours uh is just checking a box if you
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
if the two hours of instruction it might
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
be 45 minutes of content
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
it could be four hours of content you're
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
trying to shove in a you know a two-hour
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
Block it's important for me and for my
 
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
staff to make sure that we are
 
01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
representing uh appropriately as we
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
teach these uh topics not only
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
constitutional law but any law uh or any
 
01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:26.839 align:start position:0%
block of instruction that we are
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
valuing the time of the student and
 
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
we're valuing the time of the home
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
agency that is paying that student to be
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
in that seat studying uh
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
to become a police officer in the state
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and so I was very
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
concerned when there was uh actual hours
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
attached uh to this bill and and again
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh I I certainly look forward to working
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
with representative love and and
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
any other person in the state of New
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who thinks that we need to to
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
revisit what we're doing here and I
 
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
stand ready to to respond to any
 
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.069 align:start position:0%
stand ready to to respond to any
questions

01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you director did representative
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
love have an opportunity to look at
 
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
these yet like uh not yet we've
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
literally just uh saw each other we've
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
talked on the phone a couple of times
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
for the first time we've met so uh not a
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
chance yet thank you
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
um how how is how do you um
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
the course material is good how do you
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're understanding the
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
testing process that that they've
 
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
absorbed this and they know it thank you
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
very much and it's an excellent question
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know written tests are just that
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
they're written tests and and uh
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
genuinely you're measuring the student's
 
01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.450 align:start position:0%
genuinely you're measuring the student's
recall

01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
that's all you're doing is you're
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
measuring their ability to remember
 
01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.410 align:start position:0%
measuring their ability to remember
things

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
it's more important for us to make sure
 
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
that they can as the representative
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
spoke to actually perform
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
comprehend understand
 
01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
negotiate to the correct answer and
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
that's why it's vitally important for
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
those scenario and group trainings to
 
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
take place we measure on a written test
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
which is included in the back portion of
 
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:13.700 align:start position:0%
that facilitator's guide but we also
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
measure through a grading rubric that's
 
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
been designed by our curriculum
 
01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:19.849 align:start position:0%
been designed by our curriculum
coordinator

01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
coordinator
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when they do these
 
01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
scenarios and they do these group
 
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.250 align:start position:0%
scenarios and they do these group
projects

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
that they're able to take a fact pattern
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh that may be murky because let's all
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
agree that uh uh being a cop is it's a
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
murky job it's there's not a lot of
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
bright lines and you really have to to
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
be a problem solver so put these young
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
people into groups let them take those
 
01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
murky facts let them work through it
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
have discussions come to the to the
 
01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:50.579 align:start position:0%
answer that they need to come to and
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
then be able to defend why did you come
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
to this answer why do you think this is
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
the best approach
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh and it's always fun to let them
 
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
defend their position in front of their
 
01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
peers that's where the best discussions
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
happen because they're uh they're pretty
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
tough on each other too so it's a good
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
learning experience
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
um also I would ask
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
constitutional laws you know
 
01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
um Can Change by the minute sometimes
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
how do you address it once they've left
 
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
your Academy how do you how do you make
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
sure that they're keeping up with it
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question as well uh
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things in candidly
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of fell off of our radar uh
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
right around when covet hit
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh was that we provided uh a an annual
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
law update it was it was really just a
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
flyer it was no more than a flyer it is
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
my intention to uh create an annual
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
in-service program that they every
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
officer can complete online to include
 
01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:53.049 align:start position:0%
officer can complete online to include
testing

01:07:53.049 --> 01:07:53.059 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
with legal updates New Hampshire legal
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
updates that is something that our state
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
has never mandated uh but it's something
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
that I would like to Institute in 2023
 
01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
we we now have the staff to be able to
 
01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
put that together and so to address
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
those types of concerns as well as just
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
changes in in motor vehicle law and uh
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know training and things of that
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
nature I think it's very important to
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
send out the consistent clear message uh
 
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
and and attach a a testing component to
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
it as well and we can do that through
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
our online learning Bureau
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
does is there currently an insurance
 
01:08:37.849 --> 01:08:37.859 align:start position:0%
requirement that they have every year
 
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh there is not uh we have uh in
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
mandatory in-service
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh training hours that are required but
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
we do leave a fair amount of that to the
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
Chief Executive Officer of each agency
 
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
to determine what would be the best way
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
to spend those training dollars for that
 
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
particular Community uh candidly uh I I
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
I think it is important that we create
 
01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh in conjunction with the Attorney
 
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
General's office and we have a great
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the AG's
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
office to create that annual legal
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
update and we deliver it in a very uh
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
you know defined way
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
in in my last question your agency that
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
has anything to do with officer uh
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
discipline or issues that occur later
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
with their licensure
 
01:09:31.259 --> 01:09:32.630 align:start position:0%
with their licensure
um

01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
there was a scenario brought up about
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know if someone was ordered to do
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
something unconstitutional can you just
 
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:39.799 align:start position:0%
speak to that shortly if you could
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
absolutely chair uh and thank you for
 
01:09:45.769 --> 01:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
that question uh as of January 1st of
 
01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
this year uh
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police standards and
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
training now has a very clearly
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
organized conduct Review Committee that
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
has been established to address any
 
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
allegation of defined police misconduct
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
under RSA 106-l
 
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.910 align:start position:0%
under RSA 106-l
uh

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
being given an unconstitutional order uh
 
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
could very well fall under that
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee's review
 
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
certainly uh an unconstitutional act by
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
a police officer is going to in the
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
first instance negate any law
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement action that they took and
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
certainly would open them to civil
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
penalty uh for conducting that kind of
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional act and it could very
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
well expose them to criminal liability
 
01:10:37.689 --> 01:10:37.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have a quick question you
 
01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
mentioned you mentioned 12 hours of
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
training when you first began your
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
testimony was that 12 hours in
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional training or was that I
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the documents yet or is
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
that a bigger piece of stuff so uh thank
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
you for that question I looked at the
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
first part which looks like it went
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
article by article where you know the
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
Fifth Amendment and all the amendments
 
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
are important about searches and whatnot
 
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question the 12-hour
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
block of instruction is to deliver the
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
lecture and to apply the scenario
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
training for constitutional law uh it's
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
also important to understand while we
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
have this block of instruction on
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional law that builds the
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
foundation I can tell you that right now
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
I just left I I was monitoring a class
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
that was being delivered by a member of
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and that's
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
an eight-hour block on search and
 
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.970 align:start position:0%
an eight-hour block on search and
seizure

01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
seizure
 
01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
so we introduce the notion of
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
protections under the Fourth Amendment
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
and part one Article 19 of our state
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
constitution relative to searches
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
seizures and the arrest of people
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
but that these students get that uh
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
reinforced every time we have a separate
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
class we have a class on laws of arrest
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's another eight hours that builds
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
off of the 12-hour block of
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional law we have an eight-hour
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
class on search and seizure again that
 
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
revisits all of the foundation class of
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional law class uh when we
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
talk about defensive tactics and they're
 
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
down there uh you know rolling around
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
with each other and pinning each other
 
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
to the ground there is a discussion both
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
on the Constitutional application of
 
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:32.169 align:start position:0%
on the Constitutional application of
force

01:12:32.169 --> 01:12:32.179 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
and and the ethical application of force
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
as well we have we build in blocks of
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
instruction relative to ethics in in
 
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
every one of our classes as well uh
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
again it's um they're going to eat this
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
elephant but they do it in very small
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
bites throughout the 16-week academy uh
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
and I hope that answers your question
 
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.870 align:start position:0%
and I hope that answers your question
sir

01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
sir
 
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.209 align:start position:0%
sir
foreign

01:12:58.209 --> 01:12:58.219 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that and it was kind of uh
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of it might have been the
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
question about
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
what a police officer does in uh when
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
they think they're being asked to do
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
something that's unconstitutional so
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's a command a person that is in
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
authority and then being told to do
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
something that you're not quite sure of
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it could be like the famous case
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
where someone was killed and there were
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
three officers working and and you have
 
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
a a an instructor you know his boss and
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
just came out of instruction and all of
 
01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff is there training in
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
there in your uh organization to address
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
things that you might have been divulged
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
to by that kind of situation absolutely
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes uh again
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh there are uh there's statutory
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
requirements for police officers to
 
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.649 align:start position:0%
requirements for police officers to
report

01:13:50.649 --> 01:13:50.659 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
misconduct uh that is uh alleged to have
 
01:13:59.090 --> 01:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
occurred by another police officer that
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
is RSA 105 19. uh and that that requires
 
01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
officers to report uh uh specific
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
allegations of misconduct that they
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know I'll tell you a funny story
 
01:14:15.169 --> 01:14:15.179 align:start position:0%
when I very first started as a police
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
officer uh I graduated from the Academy
 
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
I went back to my home agency and
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
was talking about a situation with a you
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
know over a coffee there was a bunch of
 
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
us sitting around and and my boss came
 
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
in and I respected the guy very much and
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
he said well you could have just
 
01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
arrested him and held him for four hours
 
01:14:32.699 --> 01:14:34.370 align:start position:0%
arrested him and held him for four hours
and

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
um in fact many many years ago I'm not
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to tell you how many years ago
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
because it was a long time ago but uh
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
you actually could do that until a New
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court case uh dictated
 
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
that uh you cannot arrest somebody and
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
hold them for four hours without having
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
probable cause to make that arrest uh
 
01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
and and I I share that with this
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee because that's an excellent
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
example of how a police officer who's
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
now in a position of authority they they
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
believe that they are acting uh with
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
best knowledge and in fact there's been
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
a change in law that they're not aware
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
of uh and and candidly to representative
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
loves uh response
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
in the first instance that younger
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
officers should ask for review by a
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
higher up and if he needs to go by or
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
she needs to go by
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
that supervisor to the captain as
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative love said that's the very
 
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
first step to fix that immediately uh
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
and and certainly you know if they can't
 
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
get it fixed uh they can reach out to us
 
01:15:44.689 --> 01:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
and we can address it as well
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
um so I'm curious I I know I well I
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
guess it is kind of a two-parter
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
question but it just goes really quick
 
01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.310 align:start position:0%
question but it just goes really quick
too

01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
too
um

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm guilty of all these all the time
 
01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.970 align:start position:0%
I'm guilty of all these all the time
okay

01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
um first of all how long has this
 
01:16:04.729 --> 01:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
I believe it is on the cover uh and uh I
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm only saying that because I can't
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh I can't remember uh but this came out
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
of uh recommendations from uh the liac
 
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
commission which
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
seems like yesterday but I believe it
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
was a couple of years ago when that
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
summary report was issued and uh one of
 
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
one of the steps that I took was to
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
Corral my folks and say show me what we
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
have we need to do better let's let's
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
build this out better and that uh that
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
is a result of of that directive so
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
probably the last couple years
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
um the second part of my question is
 
01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.050 align:start position:0%
um the second part of my question is
um

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
is there I know that you know we already
 
01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
spoke to kind of can what I would call
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
continuing education just because of the
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know professions I've been in
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and that being in the process of
 
01:16:59.930 --> 01:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
being made and that would be for updates
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
and things like that my question is for
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
people who have been in the police force
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
for much longer than that module has
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
been in use did they then go back I know
 
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
that this is in the training academy so
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
this would be something you know first
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
first training is there you know has
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
there traditionally been the opportunity
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
for um for officers who maybe didn't go
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
through this you know comprehensive and
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
thorough module to go back and get that
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
same education that's a thank you for
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
that question it's an excellent question
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
candidly there's no mechanism to uh
 
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
provide that opportunity to come back
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that we can't just
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
offer this 12-hour block of instruction
 
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
as an in-service program and allow uh
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
any police officer in the state of New
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire corrections officer in the
 
01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire state corrections
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
officer to attend that particular
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
in-service program I will I will tell
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
you that um
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh anecdotally uh we are crushed for uh
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
space in our building and we have a very
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
small teaching staff
 
01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
uh and so that that also becomes part of
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
the overall discussion is uh making sure
 
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
that we're allocating resources
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
appropriately to to get the biggest bang
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
for our for our buck uh and that's why
 
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
we see the development of online
 
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
training programs to be the best way to
 
01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:30.620 align:start position:0%
address uh pushing that
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
as you spoke to that you know kind of
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
that you've been on for 10 15 20 years
 
01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.910 align:start position:0%
that you've been on for 10 15 20 years
uh

01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:41.689 --> 01:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
you know take take uh maybe not 12 hours
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
online that would be a long time but
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
maybe we we chop it up into smaller
 
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
bites of an hour or two because then
 
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
that officer can do it on duty they can
 
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
come in and have have their meal sit in
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
front of the computer and bang that out
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
quick and it also helps them maintain
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
kind of uh their in-service requirements
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
they would get credit for for uh you
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
know completing that so
 
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
wait you've you've helped me maybe uh
 
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
look at a different way of uh building
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
actually yeah representative means
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I I know one issue
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
that's come up across the country and
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it has come up here at
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
all in New Hampshire uh is the issue of
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
of some officers believing that they
 
01:19:35.159 --> 01:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
of some officers believing that they
have

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
um Supreme legal Authority and the power
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
and duty to disregard laws that they
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
regard as unconstitutional
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
um are you instructing how are you
 
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
instructing officers in the academy when
 
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
it comes to that I'm sure that many of
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
the officers are aware of that situation
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
and and how do you think it plays into
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
this conversation
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I would
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
ask for clarification I'm not uh in it I
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
apologize some of it I didn't hear
 
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh can you give me a specific example
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
sure I think that across the country
 
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
there have been folks that have called
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
themselves uh Sovereign sheriffs
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
um and when it comes to enforcing uh
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
things like Firearms laws and things and
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
um they've sometimes taken upon taken it
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
upon themselves to interpret the
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
Constitution that that that all those
 
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
laws are unconstitutional uh whether
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
they're federal or state and they refuse
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
to enforce them I'm just curious what
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
what the policy is on that in New
 
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:44.750 align:start position:0%
what the policy is on that in New
Hampshire

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and thank
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
you for the clarification as well uh
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
candidly speaking uh
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:59.510 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
uh

01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
the common sense
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
that is found as part of the Bedrock of
 
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
this state uh not only permeates
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
throughout our state but through our New
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement community
 
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.330 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement community
uh

01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:13.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
you see
 
01:21:19.090 --> 01:21:19.100 align:start position:0%
those types of situations generally with
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional officers those officers
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
that are elected by the people
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
uh here in New Hampshire I have never
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
heard I know all of the sheriffs I meet
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
with them monthly at their Association
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
meetings that is not uh that does not
 
01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:40.580 align:start position:0%
exist within the elected sheriffs here
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire I've never heard of
 
01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:46.100 align:start position:0%
a sheriff speak that way
 
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
they are presently every sheriff is a
 
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
certified police officer in the state of
 
01:21:53.290 --> 01:21:53.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
constitutionally it's not necessitated
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
but they all feel it's important to be
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
certified as a police officer as well
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh and I have never heard of that type
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
of discussion or position by any of our
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
elected law enforcement officials here
 
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering so in the bill
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
um eight hours of training as well on
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution as a New
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution addressed in this
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum or is that like a separate
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
module that the officers take thank you
 
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
for that question uh that is uh the New
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution that is
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
specifically relevant to law enforcement
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
activities is included in that block of
 
01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.910 align:start position:0%
activities is included in that block of
instruction

01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh and candidly uh I have a copy of the
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution that sits on
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
my desk uh and and candidly there's
 
01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
probably two or three
 
01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
pages of that very thick book that that
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
01:23:20.649 --> 01:23:20.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
actually can you describe
 
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
um uh just a little bit I think it would
 
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
be helpful kind of in the context of
 
01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
this decision now that or discussion now
 
01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
that I've gone ahead and raised it
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
um but what what kind of instruction is
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
currently in the 12-hour program around
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment uh what what are we
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
what are we telling officers to do to
 
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
not to do to be careful of how does how
 
01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:46.699 align:start position:0%
does that work
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
if may I refer to if you give a a short
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
answer that'd be okay that's really
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
relevant to the that's really diving
 
01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
into the the weeds of this billboard go
 
01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.130 align:start position:0%
into the the weeds of this billboard go
ahead

01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:57.140 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
I I think that we talk about the fact
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
that the Second Amendment exists uh I I
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
would really want to look at that to to
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
speak accurately to it uh
 
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
we create uh scenario training not so
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
much at the Constitutional Law class but
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
at the end of The Academy we have a what
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
we call a applied Patrol procedures
 
01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.930 align:start position:0%
we call a applied Patrol procedures
section

01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:22.940 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:24:25.729 --> 01:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
where we create a scenario where you
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
know there's a law-abiding citizen
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's carrying a firearm and and
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
um uh is protesting and and we asked the
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
recruits to negotiate that and and do it
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
in a safe way but do it in a way that
 
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
protects you know everybody's rights I
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's helpful to to
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
answering your question
 
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.709 align:start position:0%
answering your question
um

01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
it is helpful thank you very much and
 
01:24:50.689 --> 01:24:50.699 align:start position:0%
and uh sir if you want to speak offline
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
with some other questions I'd be happy
 
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
to talk with you thank you director I
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
think that to answer that question might
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
take four hours because there's a lot
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
involved in that if just for the
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
edification of the committee and perhaps
 
01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
to answer representative Muse scenario
 
01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:05.990 align:start position:0%
to answer representative Muse scenario
wise

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
wise
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
um you have a citizen walking out in
 
01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:10.340 align:start position:0%
front of the state house with an AR-15
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
what's this what what would the officer
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
be trained to do in that situation yeah
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
so uh that that happens quite often here
 
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh
 
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
can tell you that uh people who uh
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
police in New Hampshire recognize that
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
that citizen has a right to have that
 
01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
firearm uh it may be inappropriate uh in
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
the officer's mind personally that
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's bringing an AR-15 to Walmart
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh but they're they are still entitled
 
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
to do that uh the officer is going to
 
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
introduce themselves they're going to
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
explain why that they're they're
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
contacting the person who has the
 
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
firearm we've received a number of
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
complaints there's a lot of people that
 
01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
are concerned uh I'm here to just make
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
sure that everything is all right you
 
01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:01.850 align:start position:0%
sure that everything is all right you
know

01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:03.129 align:start position:0%
know
um

01:26:03.129 --> 01:26:03.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
they're generally met with I have a
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
right to have this I have a right to
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
have this we recognize that right yes
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
you do have a right to to have that just
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
understand that there's other people
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
that were concerned and they called us
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know in the end just that give
 
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
and take on the side of the road just
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
that discussion is enough to
 
01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.129 align:start position:0%
that discussion is enough to
um

01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
uh provide an opportunity for the
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
officer to evaluate whether there is a
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
threat that exists or whether it's just
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
a law-abiding a citizen who
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
chooses to bring their AR-15 to Walmart
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh and again I I spoke about it earlier
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
being a cop oftentimes it's murky it's a
 
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
you're you're in a gray area and you're
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
to do the very best you can with limited
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
information with people who
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
may not be completely Cooperative with
 
01:26:59.810 --> 01:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
you so uh so the officer is trained to
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
do the very best they can while
 
01:27:04.729 --> 01:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
protecting people's rights uh but also
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
keeping people safe and making sure that
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
crimes are not going to be committed
 
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
it's a it's quite a tightrope
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of vacancies if anybody's
 
01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.750 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of vacancies if anybody's
interested

01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you once

again honorable members of the criminal
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
justice committee I can promise you it
 
01:34:21.649 --> 01:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
was not my incent to come before you
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
three days in a row this year but I did
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
end up supporting Bill's uh that I was
 
01:34:31.610 --> 01:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on and wanted to show support
 
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
so for the record my name is Ellen Reed
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
I represent New Market and new Fields
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
um and the bill before you would codify
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
what is already certainly in my
 
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
interpretation in most people's
 
01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
interpretation uh the Constitutional
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
requirement that uh prisons and jails
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
provide basic menstruation hygiene
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
products for women or inmates who
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
menstruate so I want to just first say
 
01:35:08.689 --> 01:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
that I will use the term woman I am
 
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
using that in the biological sense I am
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
not getting into any other political
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
issues I want to strictly talk about the
 
01:35:21.129 --> 01:35:21.139 align:start position:0%
biological need for products to address
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
menstruation which is a real thing I
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
will say that not all women obviously
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
menstruate but 80 percent of women who
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
are incarcerated are of administration
 
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
age and so therefore when we say women
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
we are talking about most of the people
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about are likely to
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
need these products
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
so as I said I think that we are all
 
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
very clear both on the federal and the
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
state level Constitution that when we
 
01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
incarcerate an individual it becomes the
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the government to
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
provide for their basic health and
 
01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.649 align:start position:0%
provide for their basic health and
hygiene

01:35:56.649 --> 01:35:56.659 align:start position:0%
hygiene
 
01:35:59.530 --> 01:35:59.540 align:start position:0%
obviously menstruation falls under that
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
and when women do not have access to uh
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
period products it becomes an actual
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
health issue women and I'll speak
 
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
broadly about women what's called period
 
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
poverty who don't have access to
 
01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
products in general forced to use toilet
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
paper napkins paper towels socks in
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
incarceration those products become rare
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
as well and so they can be forced to use
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
really anything they can find that is
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
absorbent when you're not incarcerated
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
and you are in this period poverty it
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
inhibits people from being able to
 
01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:42.020 align:start position:0%
participate in Social Act activities
 
01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
there's a sense of Shame obviously that
 
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
comes with that especially if though
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
that evidence is visible it is the same
 
01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:54.659 align:start position:0%
in incarceration where women who may be
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
liable to have blood on their clothing
 
01:36:59.810 --> 01:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
would not want to engage in the small
 
01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
amount of time they get to engage in
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
social activities or in enrichment
 
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
activities that the facilities do
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
provide so
 
01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.610 align:start position:0%
provide so
because

01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
specifically in my bill I say as needed
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
as adequate for the person who's
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
incarcerated you might notice that
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note on this it's our
 
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
as I said it's already a constitutional
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
requirement I believe the reason after
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
talking with several people the reason
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal note on this is
 
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
because first of all for the most part
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
jails and prisons are already providing
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
these products but they're not
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
how should I put it maybe putting the
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
kind of priority on the needs that is
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
necessary because we do have repeated
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
anecdotes of women who are not getting
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
the products in a timely manner we're
 
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
not getting products that are
 
01:37:50.590 --> 01:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate or adequate for their needs
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
and I know that you'll hear a little bit
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
of that information today and or getting
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
it as written testimony so I won't go
 
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
into too much detail except to say that
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
um as I said there's sometimes uh
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
barriers to getting it that provide
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
um inadequate or inappropriate amounts
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
of time waiting for products uh one
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
person I know at least one woman in mate
 
01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
in the state developed an infection from
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
not being provided uh the correct or
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
adequate products
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
in addition the women who are
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
incarcerated are overwhelmingly in
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
poverty or lower income people and it
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
turns out also lower income women are
 
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
far far more likely to have gynological
 
01:38:44.890 --> 01:38:44.900 align:start position:0%
conditions that
 
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
make them more likely to need
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
menstruation products conditions like
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
PCOS where women can have extremely
 
01:38:55.570 --> 01:38:55.580 align:start position:0%
heavy and extremely long periods
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
so I happen to know from a very personal
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
examples that went with PCOS can bleed
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
for over a year and in fact can bleed so
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
heavily that most products are
 
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.129 --> 01:39:13.139 align:start position:0%
uh finally I will say
 
01:39:15.530 --> 01:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
oh I I just I'm sorry I missed this
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
point because I was just uh I got
 
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
sidetracked but the Constitutional thing
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note uh the reason that I
 
01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a fiscal note is
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
because since it's already a
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate that we take care
 
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the basic health and hygiene of
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
people who are incarcerated that and in
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
fact we do sometimes but it's not being
 
01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
followed adequately that there's no
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
extra actual money being spent and in
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
addition since it's already a
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement this does not
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
become an unfunded mandate because it's
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
already a mandate if the bill were to
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
specify a certain amount then that might
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
change but the last point that I'll
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
bring up because I do have a couple of
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
experts who made their way through the
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
snow here today I think we originally
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
were supposed to have three or four
 
01:39:59.930 --> 01:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
women who were going to give you their
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
personal experience and incarceration in
 
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the snowstorm made it
 
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to come up but we do
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
have a couple experts that managed to
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
make it today and I want to thank them
 
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
so I'll end by saying this language or
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
language very similar to this was
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
already passed by 15 States including
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
Alabama Arizona Illinois Mississippi
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
North Carolina Nebraska Tennessee and
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
Virginia so it is a a widespread problem
 
01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
that I think it doesn't hurt even though
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that it's already a
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate that we provide
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
for basic health and hygiene this is a
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
kind of built and suspenders approach
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
because right now if a person who's
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
incarcerated experiences a problem their
 
01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
only real Avenue of addressing it would
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
be to start a court case and and
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
challenge it constitutionally in which
 
01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
those resources for an inmate is almost
 
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
impossible to acquire having a law will
 
01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.669 align:start position:0%
impossible to acquire having a law will
a

01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:40:55.679 --> 01:40:56.330 align:start position:0%
a
um

01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
kind of encourage the correctional
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
facilities to obey what we believe is
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
already a constitutional mandate where
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
they might not be taking this particular
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
thing very seriously at the moment and
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh and B would provide more legal action
 
01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
available to people who experience a
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
violation of this so with that I'm I'm
 
01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:18.659 align:start position:0%
open for questions
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
um when I read that this bill was coming
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
frankly I was shocked that it would even
 
01:41:28.129 --> 01:41:28.139 align:start position:0%
be necessary and if that is the case it
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
um it certainly needs to be remedied as
 
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
that's barbaric
 
01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:34.189 align:start position:0%
that's barbaric
um

01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
can you speak to some of the possible
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
Health implications of not being able to
 
01:41:41.209 --> 01:41:41.219 align:start position:0%
take care of this I mean you can get
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
UTIs do you know anything about that
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
could you speak to that I I so a little
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
bit I'm not a medical doctor but
 
01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
um so uh I I do know of at least one
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
female inmate who's developed an
 
01:41:59.450 --> 01:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
infection from being given products that
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
were not adequate for her
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
um there there are a wide variety of
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
products that might be necessary for
 
01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:10.139 align:start position:0%
example I believe Carroll County in
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
particular only offers pads
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
um and I believe and again this is
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
anecdotal so I'm piecing together
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
information from from different stories
 
01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
but only one size or type of pad this
 
01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
can be problematic and the largest
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
basically in order to kind of cover
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
their bases but that isn't adequate to
 
01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
people with smaller bodies that can
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
bunch and not be comfortable and so I
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
know that some of the inmates there were
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
requesting things like tampons tampons
 
01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:45.260 align:start position:0%
tend to fit a wider range of women
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
because women's bodies external bodies
 
01:42:52.129 --> 01:42:52.139 align:start position:0%
tend to vary more so
 
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
um in terms of yes UTIs I have a female
 
01:42:58.689 --> 01:42:58.699 align:start position:0%
relative who developed a UTI from
 
01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:02.219 align:start position:0%
improper use and other infections as
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
well I believe things like yeast
 
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
infections but again I'm not a medical
 
01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:06.470 align:start position:0%
infections but again I'm not a medical
doctor

01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure if I don't ask someone else
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
will ask um if someone's going to talk
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
about this one of the witnesses you
 
01:43:14.770 --> 01:43:14.780 align:start position:0%
don't need to but is there specific
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
institution or or place that this has
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
happened that that brought this to your
 
01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:22.139 align:start position:0%
attention and if someone else is going
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
to talk about it personally that's fine
 
01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:26.719 align:start position:0%
so I think you will get more information
 
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
from the experts the I believe and I
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
might be getting my stories confused
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
that the Carroll County was the location
 
01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:39.179 align:start position:0%
of uh the person who got the infection I
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
believe the state tends to be a little
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
bit better in their practices but even
 
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
as we were researching it was hard to
 
01:43:47.090 --> 01:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
get information from these facilities as
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
to what their actual policies were how
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
did women who were incarcerated acquire
 
01:43:57.169 --> 01:43:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
it'll also add the health piece of
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
um inadequate if you provided too strong
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
of a product that could also run the
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
risk of toxic shock syndrome
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
question of the chairs are there any
 
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
cards from the Department of Corrections
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.129 --> 01:44:22.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you for
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
just looking over your bill very quickly
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things you alluded to is that
 
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
women may need different types of
 
01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
products I just wanted to point out in
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
your your bill it doesn't really address
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
that so the the Carroll County situation
 
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
you raised were only one type of product
 
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
is available
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
under your bill May the way that it's
 
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
currently written that may be an
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
acceptable practice I just wanted to
 
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
point that out so by one interpretation
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
I can see your interpretation by one
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
interpretation since it says any product
 
01:45:05.229 --> 01:45:05.239 align:start position:0%
designed to address menstruation
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
then you could interpret it as perhaps
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
even overly broad
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to address uh
 
01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
whether within the committee on the
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
floor or in the senate or in a committee
 
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
of conference I'm happy to address any
 
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
language changes that are necessary
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I think we want to
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair will recognize
 
01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.870 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair will recognize
um

01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
can you turn the mic on
 
01:45:56.770 --> 01:45:56.780 align:start position:0%
I should know that but I'm new thank you
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
I will try to keep my remarks as brief
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
as possible because there are a lot of
 
01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:03.659 align:start position:0%
people here and obviously I will not
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
repeat any of the points already made by
 
01:46:08.209 --> 01:46:08.219 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor I just want to
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
address a few things first I I heard the
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
chairman say that he was surprised the
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed frankly that was
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
my first reaction when I heard about a
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
bill weingard's name do we need it but
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
the fact is that we do so the question
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
is how can we craft this bill to address
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
the issue in the you know best way
 
01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
when inmates are in a you know situation
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
where their constitutional rights are
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
violated it's extremely difficult for
 
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
them to get redressed to it very few
 
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
people have the ability to mount from
 
01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
you know jail a lawsuit and try to get
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
their rights addressed so this bill will
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
clarify what the obligations are and
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
both reduce the impact on the people
 
01:46:49.850 --> 01:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
whose rights may not be respected and it
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
will also decrease the risk of a large
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional lawsuits that you know
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
will cost a lot of money for everybody
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
involved in inmates tend to use public
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
defender you know so all costs will be
 
01:47:02.209 --> 01:47:02.219 align:start position:0%
borne by the state so in my opinion this
 
01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
will definitely help in both improve the
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
practices and decrease legal risks for
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
the state which are all positive
 
01:47:09.239 --> 01:47:11.450 align:start position:0%
the state which are all positive
outcomes

01:47:11.450 --> 01:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
um the questions about you know the uh
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
specificity of the you know amount and
 
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
type of product is a very valid question
 
01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
but if we try to be overly specific it
 
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
could end up with a fiscal note and this
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
is really not the year where we wanna
 
01:47:28.129 --> 01:47:28.139 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
take the risk of the finance committee
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
which I'm brand new on so I cannot
 
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
really speak for them but just as myself
 
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
it would be best if bills would have a
 
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
minimal fiscal impact this year whenever
 
01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
that can be done while still addressing
 
01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
the issue and my concern with specifying
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
an amount for example would be that you
 
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
get into a Goldilocks situation where
 
01:47:51.169 --> 01:47:51.179 align:start position:0%
some whatever amount we specify will be
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
too much for some people who don't need
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
it and too little for other people who
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
need more I think that the use of the
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
word adequate Amounts is necessary is
 
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
really a really good way of defining
 
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
what's needed obviously the prison
 
01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
wardens and the Personnel have the
 
01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
ability to deny products that may be
 
01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
dangerous some of the potential things
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
may not be suited for a jail because
 
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
they can be modified into weapons or
 
01:48:17.689 --> 01:48:17.699 align:start position:0%
whatnot so
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
just seeing adequate's amounts of
 
01:48:22.609 --> 01:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
necessary in my personal opinion allows
 
01:48:22.619 --> 01:48:23.810 align:start position:0%
necessary in my personal opinion allows
the

01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
reasons to maintain their safe
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
environment while addressing the needs
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
and not you know specifying being too
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
specifics about the amount which would
 
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
create issues either way
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to keep it to two minutes
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
I think I'm reasonably close I
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and this is my
 
01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:40.739 align:start position:0%

01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
when menstruators do not have adequate
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
access to period products they are
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
forced to use products longer than
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
intended or attempt to make products
 
01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:40.380 align:start position:0%

using materials that are available to
them

01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
in addition to being unsanitary this
 
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
poses several physical health risks
 
01:49:46.729 --> 01:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
including toxic shock syndrome
 
01:49:49.609 --> 01:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
infections sepsis all of which can
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately lead to infertility
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
lack of access to period products have
 
01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
been linked to mental health issues as
 
01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
well period poverty is associated with
 
01:49:59.330 --> 01:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
increased risks of anxiety and
 
01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:00.830 align:start position:0%
increased risks of anxiety and
depression

01:50:10.490 --> 01:50:10.500 align:start position:0%

jail she witnessed women declining
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
visits with their families and with
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
their attorneys because they did not
 
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
have adequate access to menstrual
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
products while in their periods
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately this conversation comes down
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
to one of human dignity each one of us
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
deserves to be able to manage bodily
 
01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
functions adequately including those who
 
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
are in prison
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
for nearly half of the population this
 
01:50:41.810 --> 01:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
includes proper access to menstrual
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
products no one should be forced to risk
 
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:46.860 align:start position:0%

01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%

infertility to manage a natural body
function

01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
periods are not a luxury and the
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
products that are necessary to manage
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
them are not luxury items
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
they should be provided along with all
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
other necessary hygiene items such as
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
toilet paper to those in state or County
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
custody that require them
 
01:51:05.090 --> 01:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
I would like to thank the sponsor of
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'd also like to note that
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been at the Forefront
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
of menstrual Equity legislation for a
 
01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
few years now as some of you may know in
 
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
2019 New Hampshire was the third state
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
to require period products in public
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
middle and high schools by law
 
01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
I encourage all of you to support this
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
essential piece of legislation and
 
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
continue to Serve and Protect the
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%

snow
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
in 2017 the women from the National
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
Council wrote the contents of the
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
dignity for incarcerated women act in
 
01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
2019 U.S senators and representatives
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
reintroduced the ACT which would
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
highlight the need for improved
 
01:52:35.530 --> 01:52:35.540 align:start position:0%
conditions for incarcerated women
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative Jaya Paul pointed out
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
that the ACT among among other things
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
will ensure that mothers never have to
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
choose between calling their children or
 
01:52:45.169 --> 01:52:45.179 align:start position:0%
buying a tampon
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
accessing sufficient feminine hygiene
 
01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:49.139 align:start position:0%
products primarily in New Hampshire
 
01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
jails but also in the women's prison is
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
a concern as we sit here today
 
01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
Angelica a currently incarcerated female
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
noted that during her stay at Belknap
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
County Jail there were times when she
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
did not have enough pads and tampons
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
furthermore she was issued used
 
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
underwear which contained blood stains
 
01:53:07.609 --> 01:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
from other women
 
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
Melissa a formerly incarcerated woman
 
01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:13.139 align:start position:0%
recalls getting only and I quote giant
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
sized pads that felt like Diapers at
 
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
Carroll County Jail she was never
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
provided with tampons the underwear that
 
01:53:21.649 --> 01:53:21.659 align:start position:0%
she was issued were stained with urine
 
01:53:23.689 --> 01:53:23.699 align:start position:0%
and blood during her time at the women's
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
prison while working in the property
 
01:53:27.410 --> 01:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
Department she was part of discussions
 
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
to recycle underwear and work to sort
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
through used underwear to find quote the
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
good ones
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
Tanya also a formerly incarcerated woman
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
echoed the reality at Carroll County
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
Jail stating that she never got tampons
 
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
and was subjected to wearing stained
 
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
underwear and sleeping on sheets that
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
were also stained with blood during her
 
01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
stay at the women's prison she would
 
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
occasionally run out of tampons and ask
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
other women for extras of which lending
 
01:53:56.689 --> 01:53:56.699 align:start position:0%
and borrowing is a disciplinary offense
 
01:53:59.090 --> 01:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
Natalie recalls her previous Natalie is
 
01:54:00.649 --> 01:54:00.659 align:start position:0%
a formerly incarcerated woman as well
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
she recalls her previous experiences in
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county jail as this quote you
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
only get certain amounts of tampons
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
depending on which officer was working
 
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
the unit as a state County resident you
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
would get used underwear used bras and
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
used socks the sheets were also old with
 
01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
stains the federal residents were taken
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
care of because Liaisons visited once
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
per month to ensure that they were
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
getting their needs met at Grafton
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
County Jail the issue they issued they
 
01:54:31.729 --> 01:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
also issued underwear that were stained
 
01:54:33.649 --> 01:54:33.659 align:start position:0%
when I asked for a new pair of underwear
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
I was told you're lucky you're getting
 
01:54:37.129 --> 01:54:37.139 align:start position:0%
some because if it were up to me you
 
01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
would get nothing so I chose not to wear
 
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
any my sheets were stained with blood
 
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I was only ever given pads not
 
01:54:45.890 --> 01:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
tampons Merrimack County Jail limited
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
the amount of Tamp tampons you could
 
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
have and you had to buy them if you
 
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
needed more
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
at the prison they always gave me stain
 
01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
sheets and underwear and extra tampons
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
were hard to get because not every
 
01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
officer liked you end quote
 
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
with only three pairs of issued
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
underwear per woman and the inconsistent
 
01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
supply of feminine hygiene products many
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
of which were oftentimes very expired as
 
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
much as three or four years of the pads
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
that were handed out women are forced to
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
wash their underwear in the push button
 
01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.139 align:start position:0%
sink because the twice per week laundry
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
times are not sufficient it's also
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
important to note that washing your
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
clothes in the sink and not wearing
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
underwear are the offenses
 
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
we are talking about a basic need that
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
should be honored in a dignified Manner
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
and I encourage you to support this
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
no questions thank you oh wait sorry I
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
got one
 
01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
products on a broad stroke
 
01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:55.189 align:start position:0%
products on a broad stroke
um

01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
so would that prevent a prison from
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
saying we'll give you extra Underpants
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
that are perhaps have extra liners such
 
01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
as the ones you know like they make for
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
teenagers now that are designed to be
 
01:56:10.729 --> 01:56:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
um I I can't speak to exactly what
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
you're asking um I I think that I can
 
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
only tell you that there are certain
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
rules within the prisons the women are
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
only given three pairs of underwear they
 
01:56:21.530 --> 01:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
must prove and show
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
um the tatteredness of underwear to get
 
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
new ones
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
um in some cases if you have money on
 
01:56:28.129 --> 01:56:28.139 align:start position:0%
your quote books
 
01:56:30.770 --> 01:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
um they will not issue extra underwear I
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
know that this bill is talking about
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
feminine hygiene products we are going
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
on the record just talking about the
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
used underwear just to get it on the
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
record I know that this bill doesn't
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
specifically address that I can't really
 
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
speak to the language I hope that
 
01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
answers somewhat of your question thank
 
01:56:45.659 --> 01:56:46.970 align:start position:0%
answers somewhat of your question thank
you

01:56:46.970 --> 01:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:52.850 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
during her introduction uh
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative Reid said there there is
 
01:56:58.250 --> 01:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
a requirement in New Hampshire that
 
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
these products uh be provided but it
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
01:57:04.609 --> 01:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
the current practice may be to provide
 
01:57:09.410 --> 01:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
access to them so for example your uh
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
your example of the woman who didn't
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
have enough who had to buy more the fact
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
that more are available to be bought
 
01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
do you see that I mean do you see that
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
as part of the problem we need to solve
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
I do see that part of a problem one
 
01:57:25.129 --> 01:57:25.139 align:start position:0%
because not every woman has money to be
 
01:57:27.169 --> 01:57:27.179 align:start position:0%
able to purchase more and you can only
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
purchase more through a union Supply
 
01:57:33.050 --> 01:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
book which requires a it can take up to
 
01:57:35.689 --> 01:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
six months for a delivery to come in it
 
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
can be as little as a month so you never
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
really know and you also have to go
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
through a pretty formal process of
 
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
getting money on a slip of paper to the
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
right people and so you might not get
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
your order for quite some time it's not
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
something that you can just purchase on
 
01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
a commissary which would come in the
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
following week and I do think that women
 
01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to pick between how
 
01:57:55.850 --> 01:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
they're going to spend what maybe a
 
01:57:58.370 --> 01:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
dollar a day that they're earning money
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
on their phones to call home to their
 
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
family versus getting a box of tampons
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
that they need
 
01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:09.589 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative

my

unfortunately I'm very familiar with
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
although not in New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
horrified to hear that this the way that
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
that description was given about
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county my own
 
01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
um what I was wondering is we have a
 
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
couple of different
 
01:58:29.089 --> 01:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
um a couple of different kind of pieces
 
01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:30.659 align:start position:0%
of language here that entail different
 
01:58:32.089 --> 01:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
things right
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
um similar to what representative Muse
 
01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.149 align:start position:0%
um similar to what representative Muse
said

01:58:35.149 --> 01:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
um you know we're talking about adequacy
 
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
and then we're talking about limits
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and so what I'm wondering is if it's
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
not based on that person's individual
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
health needs what is it based on what is
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
the number based on
 
01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question excuse me I
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
can say that at the women's prison right
 
01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:52.550 align:start position:0%
can say that at the women's prison right
now

01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:58:55.490 --> 01:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
um they get a 15 a choice of like 15
 
01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
regular tampons and 15 Super tampons or
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
you can choose 30 pads but
 
01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
um you can't like have unlimited access
 
01:59:04.850 --> 01:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know who came up with that
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
number that's a great question right
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
everybody's cycle is a bit different and
 
01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
certainly changes if you have other
 
01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I you know I I
 
01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
think this is a is a great bill it's
 
01:59:25.609 --> 01:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that it's necessary
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and and just to address one of the
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
issues that was raised before about the
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
type of product that may be necessary
 
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
for one woman that was the only
 
01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:36.179 align:start position:0%
suggestion I would have is adding the
 
01:59:39.290 --> 01:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
word um inadequate amounts and types as
 
01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
necessary that would sort of cover
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
without getting too specific and because
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that just leaving it like
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
this might lead to an inmate having to
 
01:59:50.570 --> 01:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
say well it says this and they said well
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't tell us that you have to have
 
01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
tampons as opposed to so if it's just a
 
01:59:56.810 --> 01:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
more general term I'm just a suggestion
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:03.649 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:00:03.649 --> 02:00:03.659 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
after hearing some of the testimony I
 
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
almost think that we need to expand on
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
this bill yeah to because I'm frankly
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
appalled right that you get three pairs
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
of underwear and you can't wash them for
 
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
every other week or whatever that was
 
02:00:21.290 --> 02:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
twice per week is the laundry per week
 
02:00:23.089 --> 02:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
so still yeah not gonna have enough
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
right so to me that and then you get
 
02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
gigged if you wash them in the sink yeah
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
02:00:31.129 --> 02:00:31.139 align:start position:0%
yeah kind of crazy to me but yeah that's
 
02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:33.179 align:start position:0%
just me so I'm wondering if we need to
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
include that in this bill that you get
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
adequate underwear and clean sheets I
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
mean you would think we wouldn't have to
 
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
but apparently we do right
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree with you I'm not the
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
one writing the bill so but I was
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah I know I appreciate that
 
02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
though thank you for that comment
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
representative Sue Newman yes thank you
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
for taking this question you mentioned
 
02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
that products could be or would be
 
02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
available for an inmate to purchase and
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
there were you gave a couple examples of
 
02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
that do you know if the purchase price
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
is like reasonable what no we would well
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
I do sorry I do know it is not
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable Union Supply is often
 
02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:21.659 align:start position:0%
overpriced I don't have the exact prices
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
in my head but I could imagine it would
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
be as much as like ten dollars a box for
 
02:01:30.729 --> 02:01:30.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
question as
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
is this something that a visitor is
 
02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:42.169 align:start position:0%
is this something that a visitor is
allowed

02:01:42.169 --> 02:01:42.179 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
to bring no no one is allowed to bring
 
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:48.300 align:start position:0%
anything into the prisons or jails okay
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:00.179 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative Jess
 
02:02:00.179 --> 02:02:12.589 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative Jess
Edwards

02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:19.139 align:start position:0%
um I apologize for my uh uniform today I
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
testified to the on a veterans bill as a
 
02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
veteran and didn't do a quick change so
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm here uh representing Rockingham
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
District 31 an outstanding District if I
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
might say so uh and uh I
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
I am going to testify to something
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
completely different I'm from the
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
um I've been following
 
02:02:48.290 --> 02:02:48.300 align:start position:0%
um the the issue on menstrual products
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
for a while because this issue has been
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
raised with the school districts
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and I have a bill in because of
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
following that and so for particularly
 
02:03:04.990 --> 02:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
for the newer members of the committee
 
02:03:08.810 --> 02:03:08.820 align:start position:0%
typically when we look at a bill we look
 
02:03:12.010 --> 02:03:12.020 align:start position:0%
at it from a policy perspective and then
 
02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
depending on accepting assuming
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
acceptance of a policy then we look at
 
02:03:21.410 --> 02:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
it if there's a funding issue this this
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
bill does not have a fiscal note
 
02:03:25.850 --> 02:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
and that kind of that concerns me
 
02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:27.649 align:start position:0%
and that kind of that concerns me
because

02:03:27.649 --> 02:03:27.659 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I I will just State you know for the
 
02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
record this is a no-brainer from policy
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'd be stunned if this isn't in
 
02:03:39.290 --> 02:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
practice and I would want to terminate
 
02:03:42.770 --> 02:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
any leadership in the prison system that
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
isn't already doing this and complying
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
with it well uh so the policy is just an
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
obvious one
 
02:03:53.410 --> 02:03:53.420 align:start position:0%
um so so that gets us to the money issue
 
02:03:58.970 --> 02:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh Article 28 Alpha says that we shall
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
not as a legislature issue unfunded
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
mandates and so
 
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
if you look at the words here that we
 
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
shall direct the counties to provide
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
this service because of our Article 28 a
 
02:04:17.159 --> 02:04:19.790 align:start position:0%
this service because of our Article 28 a
requirement

02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
I think the state has to fund it
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
and so this is not a fisc there's no
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to this I I tried
 
02:04:32.089 --> 02:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
to get Mr siani to give me an opinion on
 
02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
whether or not my concerns about this
 
02:04:36.890 --> 02:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
were valid and
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
um and so uh so so that I would just
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
leave to the committee that I I still
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
think that there's an open issue here
 
02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
that assuming this is good policy
 
02:04:52.450 --> 02:04:52.460 align:start position:0%
um are are we
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
walking into the obligation of a 28a to
 
02:05:00.050 --> 02:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
where the state needs to fund that
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
obligation or that mandate and I'm not
 
02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
enough of a constitutional lawyer to
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
answer that but I do think the answer is
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
probably yes if we tell the counties
 
02:05:12.890 --> 02:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
they must do it the state must pay for
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
it and if we let this get out of the
 
02:05:17.209 --> 02:05:17.219 align:start position:0%
house and send to the Senate without
 
02:05:19.970 --> 02:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
paying for a new policy that's a mandate
 
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
then we are failing to do our job
 
02:05:29.450 --> 02:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:31.729 --> 02:05:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
um speaking as the chair if if this bill
 
02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
is amended in such a way or turns out in
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
such a way that it does mandate
 
02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
um it will be sent to fiscal and it will
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
be run through the procedure to ensure
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
that it's paid for
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
um so I I your your concerns are well
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
met and we will ensure that that is
 
02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:54.109 align:start position:0%
met and we will ensure that that is
followed

02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
followed
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair representative
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
um say like first
 
02:06:01.070 --> 02:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:05.219 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um so is it your premise
 
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
that tampons and pads are not a
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
medically necessary product for people
 
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
who menstruate
 
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't think I came anywhere near
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
saying that I would actually I think I
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
actually am on the record saying exactly
 
02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
the opposite this is a no-brainer of a
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
policy and if this isn't being followed
 
02:06:25.970 --> 02:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
people should be getting fired just to
 
02:06:27.050 --> 02:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
be clear if you're going to ask
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
questions of the witness he did testify
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
that he believes the policy is correct
 
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
he's concerned with the fact that if if
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
it's something new that we're mandating
 
02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
be done and paid for that we just make
 
02:06:39.050 --> 02:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
sure it's paid for that was all his
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
testimony was so do you have a follow-up
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
based on that and if I may Mr chair I I
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
I've commanded women in the in the field
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the Hostile fire zone and as a
 
02:06:52.490 --> 02:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
commander of those women I have ensured
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
that uh even in a hostile fire zone that
 
02:06:58.250 --> 02:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
they had the materials that they needed
 
02:07:01.129 --> 02:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
to remain healthy disease non-battle
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
injury is the largest way in which we
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
lose soldiers in combat and so
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
protecting the force of protecting the
 
02:07:13.550 --> 02:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
female force is is just something I've
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.370 --> 02:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
I just I just so I just want to
 
02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:24.350 align:start position:0%
I just I just so I just want to
understand

02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
guiding this now who's paying for it if
 
02:07:30.370 --> 02:07:30.380 align:start position:0%
it's not already included okay so so
 
02:07:33.649 --> 02:07:33.659 align:start position:0%
this is a technical constitutional
 
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
question and one as a representative we
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
should all be familiar with the New
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution and our
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
obligations to adhere to it Article 28
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
Alpha is very clear that the state shall
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
not issue a mandate without paying for
 
02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
the Mandate and so
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
um so I think this is probably a good
 
02:08:00.649 --> 02:08:00.659 align:start position:0%
policy I'm just warning the committee
 
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
and the chair is already aware of this
 
02:08:06.169 --> 02:08:06.179 align:start position:0%
apparently that if this mandate to the
 
02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
counties goes through this is going to
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
need a fiscal note and it will require
 
02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
the state to pay for the mandate so I I
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
will again restate a completely support
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
this is a policy I just worry about the
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
money implication and not because we
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't pay it but because we're
 
02:08:28.729 --> 02:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay it and oftentimes we
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
fail to do our duty under the
 
02:08:30.239 --> 02:08:32.270 align:start position:0%
fail to do our duty under the
Constitution

02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative if you could uh what is
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
your current um leadership position here
 
02:08:37.850 --> 02:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
in the State House
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh well I'm I'm in my second term uh as
 
02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
the chairman of Division III Finance
 
02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
Finance which is responsible for funding
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
Services I I think I was made the chair
 
02:08:53.689 --> 02:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
of that committee because I have an
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
entire Adult Career in the healthcare
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
field and uh in working in all aspects
 
02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:01.619 align:start position:0%
of it pretty much other than Direct Care
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
provision because I'm I'm not a provider
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
and and your testimony today is um in
 
02:09:10.250 --> 02:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
that role to advise the committee of
 
02:09:11.570 --> 02:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
what may potentially be a financial
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
problem that's all is that correct well
 
02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:16.139 align:start position:0%
yes sir I would just say it's slightly
 
02:09:17.570 --> 02:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
different for first it's a
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation I don't want
 
02:09:21.649 --> 02:09:21.659 align:start position:0%
to lose the site that we're responding
 
02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
to our constitutional duties and that
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
that drives it into a financial issue
 
02:09:31.609 --> 02:09:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
um I think you're a little late and I'm
 
02:09:39.290 --> 02:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
concerned that maybe
 
02:09:40.729 --> 02:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
um some of what you're speaking to was
 
02:09:43.070 --> 02:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
addressed by the prior speaker so I was
 
02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
hoping that I could just tell you what
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
the committee's already heard so that
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you could dovetail that into your
 
02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
commentary on 28a and give us your
 
02:09:52.850 --> 02:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
additional thoughts
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
um what we were told earlier is that
 
02:09:57.729 --> 02:09:57.739 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:10:00.770 --> 02:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
Constitution requires
 
02:10:02.330 --> 02:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:05.300 align:start position:0%
prisoners at the state and county level
 
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
receive adequate Health Care
 
02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:10.070 align:start position:0%
receive adequate Health Care
and

02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
County facilities
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
are already
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
providing menstrual products largely but
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
not consistently and that basically the
 
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
goal with the wording of the legislation
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that it is always provided
 
02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
and sort of cement its place among
 
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
the definition of proper health care or
 
02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:34.310 align:start position:0%
the definition of proper health care or
adequate

02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
care in general and so in that regard
 
02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
it's not a 28-day issue but was I
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
believe my understanding of the earlier
 
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.149 align:start position:0%
believe my understanding of the earlier
testimony

02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:10:46.609 --> 02:10:46.619 align:start position:0%
um traditionally it would be if we
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
decide to expand on the underwear and
 
02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
sheets issue
 
02:10:52.189 --> 02:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
um oh and that would definitely require
 
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
a new experience but I think I don't
 
02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:54.890 align:start position:0%
a new experience but I think I don't
think

02:10:54.890 --> 02:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh representatives were speaking to that
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
specifically and so I've just um curious
 
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
as far as tampons and pads of facilities
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
are already providing them and if they
 
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
if you really fall under the
 
02:11:07.790 --> 02:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
Constitutional definition of adequate
 
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
Health Care do you still believe that it
 
02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
could be a 28 day concern to sort of
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
delineate it more clearly in the law in
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
this way thank you
 
02:11:18.050 --> 02:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
question I am a health care
 
02:11:24.410 --> 02:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
administrator uh I am not an attorney I
 
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
am an Aficionado of the Constitution
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
this is uh kind of in the detailed weeds
 
02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
of what the New Hampshire Constitution
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
specifically would require of us as I
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
read this legislation it uses the word
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
necessary adequate amounts as necessary
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
for uh products and the product
 
02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
definition is pretty broad product
 
02:11:48.890 --> 02:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
designed to address menstruation so this
 
02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
would be the scope of what gets covered
 
02:11:55.450 --> 02:11:55.460 align:start position:0%
could potentially be pretty broad
 
02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
given that there's already a
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation uh I'll I I
 
02:12:02.330 --> 02:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
take it your word on on what you've
 
02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:03.950 align:start position:0%
take it your word on on what you've
heard

02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
and if it's not being followed the
 
02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
prisoners have an opportunity to file a
 
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
civil suit for having their
 
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights violated but I
 
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
would also think I'd leave it to the
 
02:12:19.729 --> 02:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
committee but the LBA will conduct
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
audits so so the allegations of of
 
02:12:26.209 --> 02:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
negligence a managerial and
 
02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
administrative negligence that I've
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
heard just here is are severe and I
 
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
would want the state the executive
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
branch to follow up to see the extent to
 
02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
which the counties are violating those
 
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights that you mentioned
 
02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:46.250 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights that you mentioned
hello

02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:51.119 --> 02:12:53.629 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
so um you mentioned that the bill
 
02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
includes terminology such as necessary
 
02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
and adequate is my understanding that
 
02:13:01.490 --> 02:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's also in the constitute the
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
section of the Constitution that speaks
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
to health care for um the incarcerated
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
that it be necessary and adequate
 
02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:09.350 align:start position:0%
that it be necessary and adequate
um

02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is do you do you
 
02:13:13.010 --> 02:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
think it would be less expensive for the
 
02:13:16.669 --> 02:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to pay for a civil suit loss
 
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
or tampons
 
02:13:20.689 --> 02:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
I I I'm I'm not going to answer that
 
02:13:22.490 --> 02:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
question because I I think that will
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
obfuscate my point my my point is if
 
02:13:28.010 --> 02:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
we're issuing a mandate from the state
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
to the counties uh and it's a new
 
02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
mandate then uh we certainly are
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay for it and I was just
 
02:13:41.930 --> 02:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
suggesting that uh given the severity of
 
02:13:45.649 --> 02:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
the abuse that I've heard uh we may want
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
to supplement that with uh an LBA audit
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
or ask the executive branch to conduct
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
an investigation because I think that's
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
just cruel I would even go as far to say
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
that it would be cruel and unusual
 
02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
punishment to deny a woman or basic
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
health care needs
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.079 --> 02:14:08.290 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

02:14:08.290 --> 02:14:08.300 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
no ask him after
 
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
um at this point I would like to call
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
um Jane Graham from the Department of
 
02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:31.069 align:start position:0%
um Jane Graham from the Department of
Corrections

02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%

to testify today
 
02:14:38.689 --> 02:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
um I would like to testify well actually
 
02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
I should add that commissioner Hanks is
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
on her way she was she sent me here
 
02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
first uh in case she wasn't able to make
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
it but she is on her way so if you have
 
02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
more questions that I'm unable to answer
 
02:14:50.330 --> 02:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
she can absolutely answer them
 
02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak
 
02:14:54.410 --> 02:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
regarding hb421 the New Hampshire
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections supports this
 
02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:58.430 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections supports this
legislation

02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
legislation

um it's a we currently provide menstrual
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
products to women who are in our
 
02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
facilities we currently have 136 women
 
02:15:10.490 --> 02:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
between our New Hampshire correctional
 
02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:12.119 align:start position:0%

we provide
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
um we do I want to speak a little bit to
 
02:15:23.229 --> 02:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
the 15 limit we do initially give 15
 
02:15:26.330 --> 02:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
products to women but there is the
 
02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
flexibility to ask for more if you need
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
them so we don't have an actual limit as
 
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
to how many that we will provide it's
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
unlimited we provide
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
um two types of maxi pads a panty
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
Shields product and two types of tampons
 
02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
you've heard people talk about
 
02:15:49.490 --> 02:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
purchasing we do allow people to
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
purchase if we the products that we
 
02:15:53.569 --> 02:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
offer aren't what individuals are
 
02:15:56.330 --> 02:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
looking for providing feminine hygiene
 
02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
products to our residents is the right
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
thing to do for the health and safety of
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
the women that we support
 
02:16:03.770 --> 02:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and it's something that we're we're
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
proud to do to help support the women

that we we house I want to thank you for
 
02:16:10.490 --> 02:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
your time today and I will take any
 
02:16:12.649 --> 02:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
questions that you have
 
02:16:15.410 --> 02:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you what is the Department's
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
policy regarding underwear for uh for
 
02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
for women they're issued three pairs we
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
a brand new underwear when at the prison
 
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
now I I can only speak to the prison I
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the county jails at all I
 
02:16:31.729 --> 02:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
don't have any awareness of those
 
02:16:33.889 --> 02:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
situations I like others have said
 
02:16:33.899 --> 02:16:35.270 align:start position:0%
situations I like others have said
anecdotal

02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
anecdotal
 
02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
um but I don't I don't follow their
 
02:16:38.750 --> 02:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
policies at all
 
02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:39.530 align:start position:0%
policies at all
um

02:16:39.530 --> 02:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:42.410 --> 02:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
so three pairs of brand new underwear
 
02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
when they arrive
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
um we laundry service is at least two
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
times a week and it's sometimes more
 
02:16:52.129 --> 02:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
than that so that's our policy
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
in sheets if sheets are stained and
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
unable to be cleaned if they're staying
 
02:16:58.310 --> 02:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
and unable to be cleaned then we would
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
dispose of those
 
02:17:01.209 --> 02:17:01.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
and if an inmate
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
runs short of products
 
02:17:07.139 --> 02:17:08.230 align:start position:0%
runs short of products
um

02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:12.169 --> 02:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
do you provide more as no we do not we
 
02:17:14.209 --> 02:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
do not limit we only limit the amount
 
02:17:16.490 --> 02:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
they're able to have at one time
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
um so that but that was not an overall
 
02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:22.250 align:start position:0%
um so that but that was not an overall
limit

02:17:22.250 --> 02:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
finally for my questions if this law
 
02:17:27.889 --> 02:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
were magically signed this afternoon by
 
02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
the governor would it cost the
 
02:17:32.089 --> 02:17:32.099 align:start position:0%
department any more money not at this
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
time it it wouldn't because we are it's
 
02:17:36.349 --> 02:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
something we already do again if there
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
were additions to it indeed but if we
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
were amended to underwear and this
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cost another dime correct thank
 
02:17:47.810 --> 02:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
you representative Newell
 
02:17:49.370 --> 02:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Roy and thank you for
 
02:17:51.490 --> 02:17:51.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question absolutely
 
02:17:53.330 --> 02:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks can probably answer
 
02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
questions even better than I can so
 
02:18:09.169 --> 02:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.089 --> 02:18:11.099 align:start position:0%
it's afternoon good afternoon honorable
 
02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
Helen Hicks I'm the commissioner of the
 
02:18:16.129 --> 02:18:16.139 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and happy to
 
02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:18:22.969 --> 02:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
um my question is you know it seems like
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
this is policy this is in the
 
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution it sounds like you guys
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
um as far as the Department of
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections and and we're you know
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
taking counties out of this are um
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
handling this very well and um you know
 
02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
as far as the the letter of the law this
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
is the policy and and it should be
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
provided for so I guess my my thoughts
 
02:18:43.610 --> 02:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
go to why is it not actually being
 
02:18:45.290 --> 02:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
implemented in these type of situations
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
and I know that these may be you know
 
02:18:49.610 --> 02:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
anecdotal and things like that but
 
02:18:51.290 --> 02:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
um so you know I guess what it really
 
02:18:52.969 --> 02:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
comes down to is accountability for
 
02:18:54.770 --> 02:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
people who don't abide by the policy and
 
02:18:55.849 --> 02:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
you know is there any way that you could
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
speak to that or if there have been
 
02:19:00.290 --> 02:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
incidents of that and you know how is
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
that handled
 
02:19:04.129 --> 02:19:04.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh question I can
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
only speak to the State Department of
 
02:19:07.490 --> 02:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
Corrections so they don't oversee County
 
02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:08.990 align:start position:0%
Corrections so they don't oversee County
jails

02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
jails
 
02:19:11.929 --> 02:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
um and I I certainly know from the
 
02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
collaboration pre
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
um this proposed bill that I've heard
 
02:19:18.169 --> 02:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
things that happen at County jails you
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
know and assure you the department
 
02:19:22.370 --> 02:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
provides for this service provides for
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
it freely and then even augments by
 
02:19:27.169 --> 02:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
allowing people to purchase more or
 
02:19:28.969 --> 02:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
different varieties that they might want
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
in addition to just want to reaffirm we
 
02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
give brand new undergarments to people
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
coming to our facilities we do not
 
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
recycle undergarments for men or women
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
for that matter
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
and you know from a perspective of
 
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
since it's not in the law at this point
 
02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
there's no level in which you could go
 
02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
from municipal or County to county and
 
02:19:55.450 --> 02:19:55.460 align:start position:0%
say are you complying with the law
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
and that's all I can offer I mean it's
 
02:20:01.969 --> 02:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
it's a well-made point
 
02:20:04.610 --> 02:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
um but I think the other value that
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
might be considered is the American
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
Corrections Association has standards
 
02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
for jails and standards for prisons so
 
02:20:12.050 --> 02:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
striving to hit those standards would be
 
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
applicable here
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:20:17.810 --> 02:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:20:21.070 --> 02:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
so before everybody starts
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
throwing horrible darts looks at me I I
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
do understand that
 
02:20:32.450 --> 02:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
that there is I don't know that I don't
 
02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
know the official name of it there's
 
02:20:35.570 --> 02:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
that some kind of a shock that that
 
02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
females can experience with a tampon
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
so thank you okay and so it's kind of a
 
02:20:45.550 --> 02:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
two-part one could that could that be
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
considered dangerous and in a facility
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of talk of the wording
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
in this is actually kind of vague for
 
02:20:59.210 --> 02:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
how deep we got into these weeds so if
 
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
this were to be amended do you think
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
that it should actually say
 
02:21:07.130 --> 02:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
you know hygiene hygiene products of
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes I think that's a
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
fair um concern I would say since we're
 
02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the incarceration of adult
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
females by that time in their life they
 
02:21:22.130 --> 02:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
know what product works best for them so
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
allowing them to make the choice that is
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate to their experience makes a
 
02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
lot of sense as an aside if that
 
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
happened in our institutions we have the
 
02:21:33.230 --> 02:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
immediate First Responders to come and
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
assist as well and health care in
 
02:21:37.370 --> 02:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
general so if they were experiencing
 
02:21:39.889 --> 02:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
something else on toward we would be
 
02:21:43.130 --> 02:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so just to clarify
 
02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so just to clarify
that

02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:48.889 --> 02:21:48.899 align:start position:0%
the wording of their choosing you
 
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
actually think would
 
02:21:52.429 --> 02:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
because doesn't say that that's not what
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
it says so like I said we kind of got
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
into the to the weeds here pretty good
 
02:21:58.490 --> 02:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
of what it doesn't say uh so I just
 
02:21:59.690 --> 02:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that you think that
 
02:22:01.370 --> 02:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
that might actually be more clear if
 
02:22:02.809 --> 02:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
it's of their choosing instead of just
 
02:22:04.429 --> 02:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
saying hey we gave you pads and here you
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
go you have your supply yeah I do think
 
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's okay I do think it's important to
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
give a menstruating uh person the
 
02:22:14.170 --> 02:22:14.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pick what works best okay
 
02:22:17.929 --> 02:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
thank you if I may clarify that
 
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
of their choosing between a pad and a
 
02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
tampon not brand names
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:33.170 --> 02:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
Q-tip versus yeah I just know there's a
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
lot of different products and different
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
prices and it would be impossible sir
 
02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
that I just learned about that I didn't
 
02:22:38.889 --> 02:22:38.899 align:start position:0%
even know
 
02:22:41.389 --> 02:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
I'm leaving it Broad
 
02:22:44.330 --> 02:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
and a general is important so that we
 
02:22:46.610 --> 02:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
can respond at least from State
 
02:22:48.770 --> 02:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
Corrections and many of my other County
 
02:22:50.330 --> 02:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
Jail superintendents do the same things
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
as state corrections so please I don't
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
want people walking away thinking the
 
02:22:55.610 --> 02:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
county jail superintendents are not all
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
doing this many do
 
02:22:59.690 --> 02:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative scitec I
 
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
think the word of their reasonable
 
02:23:03.469 --> 02:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
choosing would take care of all of that
 
02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
but I want to I'd like to make a comment
 
02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
which I think you'll understand I've
 
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
been around this place for a while it's
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
unusual to see a commissioner before you
 
02:23:15.889 --> 02:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
you see their second in command and I
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that the
 
02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner has come here thank you
 
02:23:23.389 --> 02:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:25.550 --> 02:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you for that representative
 
02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:27.770 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you for that representative
Bolden

02:23:27.770 --> 02:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
Bolden
 
02:23:30.650 --> 02:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a lot thanks for
 
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:23:33.410 --> 02:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Hanks I was hoping the
 
02:23:34.610 --> 02:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
bike could be a little closer to you
 
02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
when you're speaking
 
02:23:38.090 --> 02:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
um but my question is would you be
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
willing for the education of the
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee in general
 
02:23:42.349 --> 02:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
um because we do have a lot of new folks
 
02:23:45.469 --> 02:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
this year to explain the differences
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
between the state facility and the
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
various County facilities because we
 
02:23:52.610 --> 02:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
heard testimony earlier about for
 
02:23:54.349 --> 02:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
example Belknap was mentioned and it
 
02:23:55.969 --> 02:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to understand whether
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
or not that facility is under your
 
02:23:59.330 --> 02:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
control and some of the experiences that
 
02:24:01.849 --> 02:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
people in Belknap have had and your
 
02:24:05.090 --> 02:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
relationship to that if any and also
 
02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:05.690 align:start position:0%
relationship to that if any and also
um

02:24:05.690 --> 02:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:07.790 --> 02:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
in explaining that could you explain to
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
us how you believe this legislation
 
02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
would impact your budget versus how you
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
suspect that this legislation might
 
02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
impact the county budget and I know that
 
02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
that might be a little challenging but
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
just a primer on the difference between
 
02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
County state would be cool thank you if
 
02:24:22.730 --> 02:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
you could just say what's under your
 
02:24:25.969 --> 02:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
control and and no speculation about the
 
02:24:27.770 --> 02:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
counties please thank you very
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you chairman Roy and
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bolden for that
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
question probably because I haven't also
 
02:24:35.090 --> 02:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
had any water today yet
 
02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
um simply stated the county jails are
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
not under the purview of the State
 
02:24:40.250 --> 02:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections if you're
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
sentenced to County Jail you've received
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
a sentence of one year or less for a
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor crime and or you're in
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
pre-tile pretrial detention pending
 
02:24:52.849 --> 02:24:52.859 align:start position:0%
sentencing on a charge if you are at the
 
02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
State Department of Corrections you have
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
been sentenced to a felony level one
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
year or more I balance all this there's
 
02:25:01.370 --> 02:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
this thing called pre-trial credit so
 
02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
you may come to us with one year or more
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
but you may have pre-trial credit that
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
gives you six months it's with us that's
 
02:25:09.410 --> 02:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
really simply stated the difference
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:12.110 align:start position:0%
between the two
[Music]

02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden there was a second
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that that it will not cost
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections any
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
additional money and I could not intend
 
02:25:26.690 --> 02:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
to speculate on the cost to the county
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
jails because I don't know all of their
 
02:25:30.889 --> 02:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
varying practices and I defer that to
 
02:25:33.469 --> 02:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
them and I asked this before you came in
 
02:25:36.170 --> 02:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
the room I'll I'll ask it again if if
 
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
this law were to be amended and signed
 
02:25:40.450 --> 02:25:40.460 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
02:25:43.309 --> 02:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
that mandated that you provided as
 
02:25:46.610 --> 02:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
requested whatever necessary products
 
02:25:49.969 --> 02:25:49.979 align:start position:0%
they need and mandated clean and new
 
02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
underwear and mandated clean sheets if
 
02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
they are unable to be laundered properly
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
would that cost you another penny
 
02:25:59.330 --> 02:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
no no end
 
02:26:00.889 --> 02:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
that is good to know thank you
 
02:26:02.809 --> 02:26:02.819 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
I didn't have a question but now I have
 
02:26:06.770 --> 02:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
one because I didn't think we sheets
 
02:26:08.809 --> 02:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
were discussed here but anyway it could
 
02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
be um for women's undergarments when
 
02:26:12.889 --> 02:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
they actually submit them to be
 
02:26:12.899 --> 02:26:14.090 align:start position:0%
they actually submit them to be
laundered

02:26:14.090 --> 02:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
laundered
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
are they identified and returned to the
 
02:26:16.319 --> 02:26:17.510 align:start position:0%
are they identified and returned to the
individual

02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
because some of the testimonies seem to
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
be contrary to that
 
02:26:23.630 --> 02:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
02:26:25.849 --> 02:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
representative Newman all of the
 
02:26:29.570 --> 02:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
individuals property is labeled with
 
02:26:31.610 --> 02:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
their last name and they receive a
 
02:26:34.030 --> 02:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
specific unique number that is written
 
02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
both in permanent marker but they're
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
also labeled so they at the State
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections their laundry
 
02:26:42.650 --> 02:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
is done at a minimum twice a week and
 
02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's in addition to their base set
 
02:26:46.849 --> 02:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
that we provide to them for free and
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
then they have the ability to purchase
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
more through the specific vendors
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
just follow up yes sir and does does
 
02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
that include garments as well as the
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
sheets uh are they issued sheets as
 
02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
their property
 
02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
they are issued sheets as their property
 
02:27:07.250 --> 02:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and they are numbered
 
02:27:09.770 --> 02:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
it is not perfect sometimes they do end
 
02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
up with the wrong person but the goal is
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
that your things go in a laundry bag to
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
the laundry that you're in charge of and
 
02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
it comes back from the laundry in that
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
bag drive for you to take care of thank
 
02:27:24.370 --> 02:27:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.170 --> 02:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
02:27:30.170 --> 02:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
um of the chair uh we're preaching to
 
02:27:32.870 --> 02:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
the choir here the real issue is with
 
02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
the counties I mean we've always not
 
02:27:38.929 --> 02:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
wasted our time but uh we need somebody
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
from the county there is an association
 
02:27:43.490 --> 02:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
of counties there that seem to be the
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
people most affected we haven't heard
 
02:27:47.450 --> 02:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
from them so I'm sort of slightly put
 
02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
out I guess I would um
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
hesitate to concur but if I were the
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
type to concur I would concur
 
02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:56.330 align:start position:0%
type to concur I would concur
um

02:27:56.330 --> 02:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:57.650 --> 02:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
any further questions to the
 
02:27:58.730 --> 02:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
commissioner oh representative State
 
02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:01.070 align:start position:0%
commissioner oh representative State
League

02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.309 --> 02:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just if we get more specific about
 
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
the types of hygiene products and
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
Preferred Product style are there any
 
02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
products which you at the person level
 
02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
would say are not appropriate to be
 
02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:20.330 align:start position:0%
would say are not appropriate to be
provided

02:28:20.330 --> 02:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
um to you know in terms of feminine
 
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
hygiene for example you know I know many
 
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
teenagers use period pants right like
 
02:28:29.450 --> 02:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
specific Underpants for that or people
 
02:28:30.670 --> 02:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
who believe in sustainable
 
02:28:34.610 --> 02:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
sustainability uh might use Diva cups um
 
02:28:36.410 --> 02:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
which for those of you who don't
 
02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
menstruate are silicone and other
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
material cups that are inserted and
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
capture menstrual fluid and then are
 
02:28:49.150 --> 02:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative selig and please new
 
02:28:53.690 --> 02:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
members if I pronounce your last name
 
02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
incorrectly please let me know how to
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
pronounce it correctly that was perfect
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:59.870 --> 02:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad you brought that up because
 
02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
um the second item was one I've only
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
recently become familiar with and we
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
would not prefer a vessel that allows
 
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
for the storage of blood in a
 
02:29:12.349 --> 02:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
correctional facility because it is uh
 
02:29:14.270 --> 02:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
can be a bloodborne pathogen as well as
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
used as a weapon to assault our
 
02:29:19.010 --> 02:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
employees with what I would prefer and
 
02:29:21.770 --> 02:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
recommend if we could stick to menstrual
 
02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
pads and
 
02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
is tampon the right word I don't know if
 
02:29:27.290 --> 02:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
that's generic enough those are the two
 
02:29:30.770 --> 02:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
primary products pads is generalized
 
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
enough that it allows us which we do
 
02:29:35.630 --> 02:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
provide different heavy medium light and
 
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
thin so on and so forth same on the
 
02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:42.110 align:start position:0%
thin so on and so forth same on the
tampons

02:29:42.110 --> 02:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the menstrual underwear we do not
 
02:29:46.490 --> 02:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
provide menstrual underwear
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
that I I think we provide enough
 
02:29:52.969 --> 02:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
feminine products if I could as an aside
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
unique to the Department of Corrections
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
possibly we also have what are called
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
resident communication committees where
 
02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
myself I go quarterly and sit with
 
02:30:03.650 --> 02:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
residents who are selected among their
 
02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
peers at all the sites to bring up
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
topics of concern at the State
 
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections with the
 
02:30:11.330 --> 02:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
individuals and cars incarcerated at the
 
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire correctional facility for
 
02:30:14.809 --> 02:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
women this has never come up in six
 
02:30:14.819 --> 02:30:15.610 align:start position:0%
women this has never come up in six
years

02:30:15.610 --> 02:30:15.620 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:30:18.170 --> 02:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
and I suspect even further than that
 
02:30:20.270 --> 02:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
again it's not an issue for the
 
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
department but I appreciate the
 
02:30:23.530 --> 02:30:23.540 align:start position:0%
carefulness of your question
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
as an aside you're talking about other
 
02:30:27.050 --> 02:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
property when you're talking about
 
02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
sheets and things like that we have a
 
02:30:32.030 --> 02:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
robust property policy I would ask I
 
02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
would ask politely if we could stick to
 
02:30:36.410 --> 02:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
feminine products in this bill and if
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
you were going to look at other property
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's provided at the start of
 
02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
incarceration and during incarceration
 
02:30:47.410 --> 02:30:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and that is certainly
 
02:30:51.889 --> 02:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
understood however the testimony we
 
02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
heard regarding underwear was very
 
02:30:55.250 --> 02:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
troubling so it'd be very difficult for
 
02:30:56.450 --> 02:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
us to walk away without at least
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
examining that a little bit further
 
02:31:00.050 --> 02:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
um any other questions of the
 
02:31:04.730 --> 02:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
just a quick question if if we don't
 
02:31:09.650 --> 02:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
change this law could a future
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner roll back some of the the
 
02:31:13.969 --> 02:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
policies that you have that are
 
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
currently uh best practice
 
02:31:19.490 --> 02:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative Muse that's a fair
 
02:31:22.370 --> 02:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
question but this policies existed even
 
02:31:23.870 --> 02:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
before me
 
02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
um nationally in Corrections this is
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
what you do
 
02:31:34.969 --> 02:31:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:37.250 --> 02:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions thank
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
you very much for coming again
 
02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and um is there anyone else
 
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify who is not what who
 
02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:51.889 --> 02:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
I promise not to ask any more questions
 
02:31:56.030 --> 02:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.710 --> 02:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
um I recall
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
maybe in Prior years
 
02:32:05.389 --> 02:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
that you spoke to receiving in prisoners
 
02:32:09.170 --> 02:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
from County who had long-standing
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
medical issues that hadn't been
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
addressed in their County facility and
 
02:32:14.690 --> 02:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
that the responsibility for addressing
 
02:32:16.190 --> 02:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
them fell to you because they would be
 
02:32:18.290 --> 02:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
in your care for so long and because you
 
02:32:20.590 --> 02:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
have these enhanced policies for care
 
02:32:23.330 --> 02:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
prisoners and I was just curious if
 
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
you've ever received or like maybe had
 
02:32:27.770 --> 02:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
conversations with prisoners who were in
 
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
County facilities who reported
 
02:32:33.710 --> 02:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
um to you something related to
 
02:32:36.050 --> 02:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
menstruation that they experienced in
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
county that didn't satisfy your state
 
02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
if you could answer that without
 
02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
specifically getting into County names
 
02:32:48.889 --> 02:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
that would be appreciated happy to do
 
02:32:50.809 --> 02:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
that representative Bolden that's not
 
02:32:52.490 --> 02:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
been something someone shared upon
 
02:32:55.490 --> 02:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
admission the history you recall I think
 
02:32:57.170 --> 02:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
being more poignant we received somebody
 
02:32:59.090 --> 02:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
with for example a broken arm from a
 
02:33:01.250 --> 02:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
facility that had not been mended but
 
02:33:03.770 --> 02:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
not on the menstruation topic
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:33:07.610 --> 02:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
um I will be appointing a subcommittee
 
02:33:12.130 --> 02:33:12.140 align:start position:0%
on this and the subcommittee will be
 
02:33:14.030 --> 02:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes representative
 
02:33:15.410 --> 02:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
saley representative Newell
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bolin representative
 
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
Murphy representative Rhodes will be the
 
02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:23.210 align:start position:0%
Murphy representative Rhodes will be the
chair

02:33:23.210 --> 02:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative Pruitt wanted to be on it
 
02:33:26.090 --> 02:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
but I didn't think it would be a good
 
02:33:26.100 --> 02:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
but I didn't think it would be a good
idea

02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
and with that the public hearing on HB
 
02:33:38.050 --> 02:33:38.060 align:start position:0%
what was that
 
02:33:41.210 --> 02:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
14 41 is closed and we'll be in recess
 
02:33:44.090 --> 02:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
until one o'clock is that right
 
02:33:48.170 --> 02:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:56.830 align:start position:0%
 
130.

02:33:56.830 --> 02:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:51.950 --> 03:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:51.960 --> 03:32:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:59.809 --> 03:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
at this time we will be opening the
 
03:33:03.530 --> 03:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
public hearing on hb216
 
03:33:06.250 --> 03:33:06.260 align:start position:0%
and the chair will recognize
 
03:33:08.690 --> 03:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
Representatives Santa nastazo to
 
03:33:13.849 --> 03:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:15.650 --> 03:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of the
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee
 
03:33:20.450 --> 03:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to rep to introduce House
 
03:33:23.530 --> 03:33:23.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 216 to exempt die
 
03:33:26.090 --> 03:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
methotryptamine from the controlled Drug
 
03:33:26.100 --> 03:33:27.229 align:start position:0%
methotryptamine from the controlled Drug
Act

03:33:27.229 --> 03:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
Act
 
03:33:30.650 --> 03:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
all right so uh Consciousness is a
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
strange phenomenon it can't be explained
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to think about we
 
03:33:36.410 --> 03:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
actually don't even know how to define
 
03:33:36.420 --> 03:33:37.790 align:start position:0%
actually don't even know how to define
it

03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:33:41.450 --> 03:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
um dmt's substance that may be a link
 
03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
between the physical world and the
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
spiritual world so dimethyltryptamine
 
03:33:48.290 --> 03:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
commonly known as DMT is a naturally
 
03:33:49.849 --> 03:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
occurring psychedelic substance that's
 
03:33:52.010 --> 03:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
been used for centuries and traditional
 
03:33:55.070 --> 03:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
spiritual practice DMT can be smoked or
 
03:33:57.710 --> 03:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
Vaped can be ingested as T in the form
 
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
of Ayahuasca DMT is speculated to exist
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
in all animal and plant life but it's
 
03:34:05.330 --> 03:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
known to exist in uh hundreds and
 
03:34:07.250 --> 03:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
thousands known thousands of plant and
 
03:34:09.469 --> 03:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
animal species and it's also in the
 
03:34:10.670 --> 03:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
human body
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh believed to be produced in the penal
 
03:34:15.170 --> 03:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
gland of the brain so this molecular
 
03:34:16.729 --> 03:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
compound is extremely common on Earth
 
03:34:18.530 --> 03:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
and no one actually
 
03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
knows why it exists or what its function
 
03:34:24.410 --> 03:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
is in plants and animals because we just
 
03:34:27.769 --> 03:34:27.779 align:start position:0%
have no research on it so uh according
 
03:34:30.290 --> 03:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
to the National survey on drug use and
 
03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
health less than one percent of
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
Americans age 12 and old are reported
 
03:34:36.170 --> 03:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
using DMT at least once in their
 
03:34:36.180 --> 03:34:37.090 align:start position:0%
using DMT at least once in their
lifetime

03:34:37.090 --> 03:34:37.100 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
03:34:41.450 --> 03:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
so DMT is just not abused
 
03:34:45.050 --> 03:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
all right and uh I have a lot of
 
03:34:47.210 --> 03:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
testimony here on actually the effects
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
of DMT but I'm going to defer that to
 
03:34:52.190 --> 03:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
Derek who's uh actual expert
 
03:34:54.590 --> 03:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just talk about freedom to
 
03:34:58.250 --> 03:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
practice religion so uh in 2006 there
 
03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
was a Supreme Court case where U.S
 
03:35:02.510 --> 03:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
custom agents seized over uh 30 gallons
 
03:35:04.849 --> 03:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
of Ayahuasca that was being shipped to a
 
03:35:06.830 --> 03:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
church in New Mexico and the Supreme
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
Court unanimously delivered judgment in
 
03:35:11.510 --> 03:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
favor of the church under the 1993
 
03:35:14.570 --> 03:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
religious freedom restoration act uh
 
03:35:16.729 --> 03:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
chief justice Roberts held that the
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
government had not adequately
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrated had a compelling interest
 
03:35:22.250 --> 03:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
in Banning what even Federal prosecutors
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
admit is a sincere religious practice
 
03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
and uh so there's just churches uh using
 
03:35:32.710 --> 03:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
DMT and Ayahuasca and ceremonies
 
03:35:35.269 --> 03:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
becoming uh rapidly mainstream in the
 
03:35:37.010 --> 03:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
United States and Canada so any
 
03:35:38.570 --> 03:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
restriction on the substance when
 
03:35:40.729 --> 03:35:40.739 align:start position:0%
intended to be used in a religious
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
practice is a violation of Article 5 of
 
03:35:44.690 --> 03:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution where
 
03:35:46.190 --> 03:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
every individual has a natural and
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
unannual right to worship God according
 
03:35:50.210 --> 03:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
to the dictates of his own conscious and
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
reason and no subject shall be hurt
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
molested or restrained in his person
 
03:35:57.170 --> 03:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
Liberty or estate for worshiping God in
 
03:35:59.150 --> 03:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
the manner in season most agreeable to
 
03:36:01.610 --> 03:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
the dictates of his own conscious or for
 
03:36:04.849 --> 03:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
his religious profession sentiments or
 
03:36:07.490 --> 03:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
persuasion provided he does not disturb
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
the public peace or disturb others in
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
their religious warship
 
03:36:14.870 --> 03:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so uh any questions I would actually
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
like you guys as far as what DMT does
 
03:36:18.830 --> 03:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
and how it works I'd like you did it
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
defer to Derek he's talked to lots of uh
 
03:36:24.530 --> 03:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
phds and people that I know this topic
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
and has uh extensive experience with it
 
03:36:31.969 --> 03:36:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.979 --> 03:36:32.929 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:36:32.929 --> 03:36:32.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:32.939 --> 03:36:34.010 align:start position:0%
um
could

03:36:34.010 --> 03:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
um regarding the religions
 
03:36:38.690 --> 03:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm a Catholic and I must have missed
 
03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
that memo from the pope but is there can
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
you tell me the religions I do actually
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
um use this as part of their common
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
practice if you know uh so there's uh
 
03:36:50.750 --> 03:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
South American and uh Amazon Amazon
 
03:36:53.929 --> 03:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
areas the Shaman's there have used it
 
03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
for centuries uh so that practice has
 
03:37:01.010 --> 03:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
been sort of coming uh to the West
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.250 --> 03:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:11.210 --> 03:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
how would you actually uh obtain uh this
 
03:37:13.130 --> 03:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
chemical now
 
03:37:17.450 --> 03:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
well uh it exists in most plant life if
 
03:37:20.330 --> 03:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
not all and I think the most there's it
 
03:37:22.969 --> 03:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
can be synthesized artificially
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh but I think most people actually get
 
03:37:28.010 --> 03:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
it from a root bark that's imported from
 
03:37:31.010 --> 03:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
Brazil and they somehow mix it with some
 
03:37:33.170 --> 03:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
stuff and extract the actual DMT
 
03:37:33.180 --> 03:37:35.690 align:start position:0%
stuff and extract the actual DMT
chemical

03:37:35.690 --> 03:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.700 --> 03:37:40.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:37:40.130 --> 03:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:42.170 --> 03:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
so is it a is it a commercially
 
03:37:45.469 --> 03:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
available uh available drug or is it
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a make it yourself in your
 
03:37:49.010 --> 03:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
kitchen kind of a drug
 
03:37:52.250 --> 03:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
so the root bark itself is is legal as
 
03:37:54.050 --> 03:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
lots of plants are legal you can go
 
03:37:56.210 --> 03:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
outside and pick some maple leaves and
 
03:37:58.130 --> 03:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
that's legal uh
 
03:38:01.130 --> 03:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
but yeah then someone has to actually
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh do something with the plant to get
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
the DMT extracted out of it when the
 
03:38:08.269 --> 03:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
when the DMT is extracted out in its in
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
its purest form at that moment it's a
 
03:38:17.450 --> 03:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:19.490 --> 03:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
you've missed two critical ingredients
 
03:38:23.929 --> 03:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
do you get high from this stuff and is
 
03:38:28.190 --> 03:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
is it addictive yeah so I left I had
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
written testimony on this and I wanted
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
to skip it for Derek uh but is not
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
addictive and uh you'd have to Define
 
03:38:38.570 --> 03:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
getting high on it
 
03:38:40.250 --> 03:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
for me to answer that what does that
 
03:38:40.260 --> 03:38:41.990 align:start position:0%
for me to answer that what does that
mean

03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:38:43.849 --> 03:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
um let me take a stab at it would it
 
03:38:45.290 --> 03:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
interfere with your operation of Motor
 
03:38:45.300 --> 03:38:46.490 align:start position:0%
interfere with your operation of Motor
Vehicle

03:38:46.490 --> 03:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
Vehicle
 
03:38:48.290 --> 03:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
I would definitely not want to operate
 
03:38:51.170 --> 03:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
more vehicle uh under influence of this
 
03:38:51.180 --> 03:38:56.929 align:start position:0%
more vehicle uh under influence of this
drug

03:38:56.929 --> 03:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:59.950 --> 03:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
03:39:04.490 --> 03:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking
 
03:39:10.250 --> 03:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:12.769 --> 03:39:12.779 align:start position:0%
uh like I was saying that kind of
 
03:39:14.570 --> 03:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
question would be much better answered
 
03:39:19.190 --> 03:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
by Derek uh but uh DMT gives us insight
 
03:39:22.610 --> 03:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
into our own Consciousness uh it can
 
03:39:25.490 --> 03:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
take it takes people their testimony of
 
03:39:27.530 --> 03:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
people that have taken this uh this
 
03:39:30.110 --> 03:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
substance is really bizarre but they go
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
and they go to another uh world as they
 
03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
see it and I mean uh it has a reputation
 
03:39:37.370 --> 03:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
for being known as the god molecule
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
because it actually will convert in
 
03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:49.190 --> 03:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative saley thank you so I just
 
03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
want to clarify so it's essentially a
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
hallucinogenic in its properties is that
 
03:39:58.090 --> 03:39:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair would recognize
 
03:40:10.250 --> 03:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh Derek show Joe zazewski
 
03:40:14.269 --> 03:40:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon
 
03:40:19.849 --> 03:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
um my name is Derek janazewski I am the
 
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
founding pastor
 
03:40:24.290 --> 03:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
for pachamama Sanctuary we are an
 
03:40:25.729 --> 03:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
Ayahuasca church here in New Hampshire
 
03:40:30.429 --> 03:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
we've been operating since uh the end of
 
03:40:33.710 --> 03:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
2019 I'm sorry the beginning of 2019 in
 
03:40:36.889 --> 03:40:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.889 --> 03:40:39.899 align:start position:0%
Ayahuasca is a plant medicine it's a tea
 
03:40:45.469 --> 03:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
it's generated by making tea with a leaf
 
03:40:49.130 --> 03:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
from a shakuna plant and a vine called
 
03:40:49.140 --> 03:40:50.809 align:start position:0%
from a shakuna plant and a vine called
ayahuasca

03:40:50.809 --> 03:40:50.819 align:start position:0%
ayahuasca
 
03:40:53.929 --> 03:40:53.939 align:start position:0%
uh shakuna is c h
 
03:40:59.450 --> 03:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
a c r u n a chakruna and Ayahuasca I
 
03:41:01.790 --> 03:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
think you have the spelling on that
 
03:41:03.950 --> 03:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
Ayahuasca is the vine Ayahuasca doesn't
 
03:41:03.960 --> 03:41:04.849 align:start position:0%
Ayahuasca is the vine Ayahuasca doesn't
have

03:41:04.849 --> 03:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:41:07.929 --> 03:41:07.939 align:start position:0%
it has very very little DMT in it or
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.690 --> 03:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine comes from the
 
03:41:17.210 --> 03:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
chicuna leaf and it's boiled together
 
03:41:21.170 --> 03:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
like tea and drunk like tea there's no
 
03:41:23.150 --> 03:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
um there's no processing that's gone on
 
03:41:26.750 --> 03:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
there's no chemicals that go into it and
 
03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
this Ayahuasca is can is uh is worshiped
 
03:41:34.729 --> 03:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
in South America as a medicine and it's
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
a medicine for the soul
 
03:41:39.530 --> 03:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
um it's a beautiful beautiful teacher
 
03:41:42.889 --> 03:41:42.899 align:start position:0%
and it connects us with another level of
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
Consciousness things that we hide from
 
03:41:45.239 --> 03:41:46.309 align:start position:0%
Consciousness things that we hide from
ourselves

03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
03:41:50.090 --> 03:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
so what it allows us to do is go inside
 
03:41:54.250 --> 03:41:54.260 align:start position:0%
of our mind most drugs like alcohol
 
03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
cocaine and opiates they're abused so
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
that people can forget or stop feeling
 
03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:05.630 align:start position:0%
that people can forget or stop feeling
something

03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
what Ayahuasca does with DMT is it
 
03:42:11.929 --> 03:42:11.939 align:start position:0%
allows people to feel those things
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
and instead of running away from them
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
and it's an uncomfortable process it
 
03:42:19.490 --> 03:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel good it's not a happy
 
03:42:22.610 --> 03:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
enjoyable experience
 
03:42:25.190 --> 03:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
um but when we take our ego away and we
 
03:42:27.490 --> 03:42:27.500 align:start position:0%
can start to feel those feelings with
 
03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine with Ayahuasca
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
um it allows us to get closer to God
 
03:42:35.809 --> 03:42:35.819 align:start position:0%
because our separation is not with God
 
03:42:37.849 --> 03:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
it's with ourselves
 
03:42:41.330 --> 03:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
and so this molecule this beautiful
 
03:42:44.330 --> 03:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
molecule allows us to connect deeply
 
03:42:46.610 --> 03:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
with our inner spirit and reconnect with
 
03:42:46.620 --> 03:42:47.570 align:start position:0%
with our inner spirit and reconnect with
God

03:42:47.570 --> 03:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
God
 
03:42:50.210 --> 03:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
it's my Sacrament and I wouldn't be
 
03:42:52.490 --> 03:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
alive without it
 
03:42:55.130 --> 03:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
um I've have about 2 000 members of my
 
03:42:57.290 --> 03:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
church at this point two thousand
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
members of my church and I've had dozens
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
dozens of men and women who have come
 
03:43:04.969 --> 03:43:04.979 align:start position:0%
some of them were addicts some of them
 
03:43:08.450 --> 03:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
were veterans that gave a lot to this
 
03:43:11.210 --> 03:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
country some of them are soccer moms
 
03:43:15.229 --> 03:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
that were sexually abused and they've
 
03:43:16.870 --> 03:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
come to me and told me that they were
 
03:43:19.790 --> 03:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
suicidal before coming they were going
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
to kill themselves if it didn't work and
 
03:43:25.190 --> 03:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
they now have beautiful lives almost all
 
03:43:26.929 --> 03:43:26.939 align:start position:0%
of them I'm in contact with them all the
 
03:43:28.910 --> 03:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
time at least once every couple of
 
03:43:32.210 --> 03:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
months we exchange emails I have zoom
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
calls where they come
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
um this molecule is present in almost
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
every single living thing almost every
 
03:43:43.309 --> 03:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
animal on the planet has this in it
 
03:43:46.130 --> 03:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
um and it has something to do with the
 
03:43:48.410 --> 03:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
connection of Consciousness uh the
 
03:43:50.450 --> 03:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
molecule itself looks almost identical
 
03:43:53.630 --> 03:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
to serotonin but right now all of you
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
have DMT in your body currently at this
 
03:43:58.570 --> 03:43:58.580 align:start position:0%
moment right now we all do right
 
03:44:01.929 --> 03:44:01.939 align:start position:0%
serotonin is a feel-good chemical
 
03:44:04.610 --> 03:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
DMT or dimethyltryptamine has almost
 
03:44:07.490 --> 03:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
exactly the same makeup so it attaches
 
03:44:10.490 --> 03:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
to the same exact receptors
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
um it's just in a different way
 
03:44:16.190 --> 03:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's very very safe it's it's not
 
03:44:18.349 --> 03:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
abusable nobody wants to take this stuff
 
03:44:20.150 --> 03:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
all the time it's a very intense
 
03:44:23.150 --> 03:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
experience and having that much energy
 
03:44:25.969 --> 03:44:25.979 align:start position:0%
and that much presence of a spiritual
 
03:44:27.769 --> 03:44:27.779 align:start position:0%
experience it's something that somebody
 
03:44:30.530 --> 03:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
might want to do once a year
 
03:44:32.030 --> 03:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
um it's nothing that would make somebody
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
want to steal their neighbor's car or a
 
03:44:37.190 --> 03:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
catalytic converter to get more of it
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
it's not like that it's it's it's it's
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
never going to be like that
 
03:44:45.050 --> 03:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
um it's an experience with God and
 
03:44:46.250 --> 03:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
that's scary
 
03:44:48.410 --> 03:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
an experience with love that's a really
 
03:44:50.929 --> 03:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
scary thing
 
03:44:52.969 --> 03:44:52.979 align:start position:0%
um it's self-love it teaches people to
 
03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
love themselves again
 
03:44:57.309 --> 03:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
that's what serotonin helps us do too
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
it rebalances a lot of the brain
 
03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
chemicals like oxytocin melatonin
 
03:45:02.960 --> 03:45:05.590 align:start position:0%
chemicals like oxytocin melatonin
serotonin

03:45:05.590 --> 03:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
serotonin
 
03:45:08.330 --> 03:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
cortisol especially
 
03:45:11.410 --> 03:45:11.420 align:start position:0%
um so after an experience with
 
03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
dimethyltryptamine people's cortisol
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
levels drop significantly it gives them
 
03:45:19.250 --> 03:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
sometimes a few days sometimes a few
 
03:45:23.150 --> 03:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
weeks of a level mind it relieves the
 
03:45:26.090 --> 03:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
symptoms of depression
 
03:45:28.330 --> 03:45:28.340 align:start position:0%
um and I would say that it does have
 
03:45:31.849 --> 03:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
medicinal value for sure
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's being studied right now at Johns
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hopkins very very deeply in the form of
 
03:45:41.929 --> 03:45:41.939 align:start position:0%
um psilocybin because psilocybin breaks
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
down to DMT
 
03:45:46.190 --> 03:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
psilocybin turns into solosin and then
 
03:45:48.410 --> 03:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
when it gets in the bloodstream and Adam
 
03:45:51.290 --> 03:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
pops off and it becomes DMT it's the
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
same molecule it's the same molecule
 
03:45:54.840 --> 03:45:56.030 align:start position:0%
same molecule it's the same molecule
um

03:45:56.030 --> 03:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:58.729 --> 03:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
religions around this have been around
 
03:46:00.889 --> 03:46:00.899 align:start position:0%
for thousands of years as best we can
 
03:46:00.899 --> 03:46:01.729 align:start position:0%
for thousands of years as best we can
tell

03:46:01.729 --> 03:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
tell
 
03:46:03.469 --> 03:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
there's two that came from South America
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
that are presently operating in the
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
country both have had uh unanimous
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
decisions from the U.S Supreme Court 9-0
 
03:46:14.330 --> 03:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
both times and that's Santo dime and the
 
03:46:16.250 --> 03:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
udv these are both Brazilian churches
 
03:46:17.450 --> 03:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
that came here and they're operating
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
here uh above board with exemptions from
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
the DEA
 
03:46:26.269 --> 03:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
the DEA has paid me a visit
 
03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
and we talked about it and um they're
 
03:46:33.050 --> 03:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
not gonna they're not gonna prosecute me
 
03:46:36.889 --> 03:46:36.899 align:start position:0%
um it's the first amendment protects me
 
03:46:38.990 --> 03:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
um but that protects me there's other
 
03:46:41.690 --> 03:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
people out there that don't want to come
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
to a retreat at my place or don't want
 
03:46:46.309 --> 03:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
to feel religious
 
03:46:48.290 --> 03:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
they deserve to explore their own mind I
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
think that's my view
 
03:46:50.399 --> 03:46:51.469 align:start position:0%
think that's my view
um

03:46:51.469 --> 03:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:53.150 --> 03:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
kind of talk for a lot so if anybody has
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.290 --> 03:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:47:03.469 --> 03:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:47:06.410 --> 03:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
um given the the um effects that you've
 
03:47:08.750 --> 03:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
described why would you what's your
 
03:47:10.729 --> 03:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
opinion as to why the medical community
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
isn't using this or hasn't been using
 
03:47:15.290 --> 03:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
this since it's well known
 
03:47:16.969 --> 03:47:16.979 align:start position:0%
um why are they not using it to treat
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
the depression is it given our mental
 
03:47:22.670 --> 03:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
health uh crisis that we're all saying
 
03:47:25.130 --> 03:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
why would you think that if it has all
 
03:47:26.690 --> 03:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
those benefits that it's not being used
 
03:47:29.210 --> 03:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
by the medical community to address to
 
03:47:30.530 --> 03:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
help address those
 
03:47:33.590 --> 03:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a great question
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and I have some opinions that I'll
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
keep to myself but they're currently
 
03:47:39.710 --> 03:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
studying it right now in a lot of
 
03:47:42.170 --> 03:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
universities across the country like I
 
03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
like I mentioned Johns Hopkins they're
 
03:47:45.710 --> 03:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
studying this deeply
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and my view is is that psilocybin is
 
03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
a lot more
 
03:47:55.610 --> 03:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
um well known but DMT is being studied
 
03:47:58.010 --> 03:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's being studied a lot right now this
 
03:47:59.929 --> 03:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
new psychedelic Renaissance is brought
 
03:47:59.939 --> 03:48:01.250 align:start position:0%
new psychedelic Renaissance is brought
on

03:48:01.250 --> 03:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:09.290 --> 03:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
it takes a while for that to come and uh
 
03:48:14.570 --> 03:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:17.090 --> 03:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
it's free correct
 
03:48:17.100 --> 03:48:20.990 align:start position:0%
it's free correct
yes

03:48:20.990 --> 03:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:23.929 --> 03:48:23.939 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
03:48:26.809 --> 03:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
do you have any medical expertise uh in
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of the impact or potential
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
impact of of a drug like this
 
03:48:36.830 --> 03:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
um on somebody who who not only has a
 
03:48:38.809 --> 03:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
mental health issue but who may also
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
have a form of chemical dependency so
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
taking DMT with with alcohol or taking
 
03:48:50.090 --> 03:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
it with an antidepressant or taking it
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
with another type of drug which is very
 
03:48:54.349 --> 03:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
common among people who abuse drugs they
 
03:48:57.349 --> 03:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
abuse multiple drugs do you have any
 
03:48:59.110 --> 03:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the potential interaction
 
03:49:02.990 --> 03:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
the DMT might have if someone like that
 
03:49:04.729 --> 03:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
used it
 
03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
I do
 
03:49:09.710 --> 03:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
so the interactions with most other
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
drugs are safe
 
03:49:12.239 --> 03:49:13.670 align:start position:0%
drugs are safe
however

03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:49:18.590 --> 03:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that DMT is almost a
 
03:49:23.450 --> 03:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
carbon copy of Serotonin if somebody is
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
taking an antidepressant like Celexa
 
03:49:27.190 --> 03:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
Alexa Lexapro
 
03:49:30.170 --> 03:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
Wellbutrin things of that nature the
 
03:49:30.180 --> 03:49:31.610 align:start position:0%
Wellbutrin things of that nature the
ssris

03:49:31.610 --> 03:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
ssris
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
well then you can have a flood of
 
03:49:36.650 --> 03:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
Serotonin and that person can go into
 
03:49:39.229 --> 03:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
something called serotonin syndrome the
 
03:49:40.849 --> 03:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
serotonin syndrome is an awful
 
03:49:40.859 --> 03:49:42.710 align:start position:0%
serotonin syndrome is an awful
experience

03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
um it's it's very very rarely fatal
 
03:49:48.110 --> 03:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
um but it's really an uncomfortable
 
03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:49.849 align:start position:0%
um but it's really an uncomfortable
experience

03:49:49.849 --> 03:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:49:52.070 --> 03:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
um it's a raised uh raised heart rate
 
03:49:56.090 --> 03:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
raised blood pressure and uh lowered
 
03:49:58.130 --> 03:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
respiration rate or raised restoration
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
rate well since their serotonin
 
03:50:02.210 --> 03:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
regulates all those things the
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
respiration rate the blood pressure and
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
the um and the heart rate uh serotonin
 
03:50:10.130 --> 03:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
syndrome makes them all kind of go
 
03:50:15.290 --> 03:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
Haywire you know I have been around no
 
03:50:17.330 --> 03:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
less than 5 000 people that have taken
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
this and I would say
 
03:50:21.889 --> 03:50:21.899 align:start position:0%
maybe a hundred people have been
 
03:50:25.010 --> 03:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
dishonest about their use of
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
um of uh antidepressants that's really
 
03:50:29.330 --> 03:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
the main one
 
03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
um and of those hundred I had four
 
03:50:33.650 --> 03:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
people that had a difficult experience
 
03:50:37.250 --> 03:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
and no medical emergencies I've spoken
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
03:50:42.290 --> 03:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
neuroscientists from Harvard about this
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
and multiple doctors nurses and EMTs to
 
03:50:49.130 --> 03:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
make sure that the safety of this is
 
03:50:52.130 --> 03:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
incredibly important and
 
03:50:54.769 --> 03:50:54.779 align:start position:0%
um theoretically it can it can be fatal
 
03:50:58.849 --> 03:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
if combined with uh with um
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
an antidepressant but there isn't a case
 
03:51:03.950 --> 03:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
that we can find
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
um the the lethalia this is is almost
 
03:51:07.439 --> 03:51:08.750 align:start position:0%
um the the lethalia this is is almost
zero

03:51:08.750 --> 03:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
zero
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
as far as I know there's there's been no
 
03:51:13.849 --> 03:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
cases in the United States that DMT has
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.229 --> 03:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
um I have a question if
 
03:51:24.469 --> 03:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
as you know with opioids there there's a
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
Narcan is there something that can can
 
03:51:28.370 --> 03:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
bring someone out of one of these
 
03:51:31.309 --> 03:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
experiences if they're having a an issue
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes lemon lemon and salt
 
03:51:38.210 --> 03:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
it it pretty much neutralizes the the
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
molecule and makes it Blow apart it's
 
03:51:42.110 --> 03:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
it's a natural remedy to a natural
 
03:51:42.120 --> 03:51:43.910 align:start position:0%
it's a natural remedy to a natural
molecule

03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
molecule
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
lemon and salt
 
03:51:45.479 --> 03:51:51.110 align:start position:0%
lemon and salt
mm-hmm

03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
um I I looked into this in advance and
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
was trying to find some studies I'm glad
 
03:51:57.650 --> 03:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
to hear that there are some that are in
 
03:51:59.510 --> 03:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
process now so I can kind of follow up
 
03:52:01.790 --> 03:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
on those ones I'm curious with your
 
03:52:04.849 --> 03:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
experience vast experience
 
03:52:07.550 --> 03:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
um what is your process since this you
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
know kind of hasn't gone through the
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
study process and isn't currently being
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
used medically professionally as as far
 
03:52:16.790 --> 03:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
as I'm aware what is the process that
 
03:52:18.710 --> 03:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
you've come to find is
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
um the right way I mean the amount uh
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
questions you need to ask in advance the
 
03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
process for intake essentially of
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
someone who who is coming to you and
 
03:52:31.790 --> 03:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
wants to experience that yeah
 
03:52:34.490 --> 03:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so for me what I have is a medical
 
03:52:38.570 --> 03:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
form I have them sit with a nurse to go
 
03:52:41.090 --> 03:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
over their medical form when they come
 
03:52:42.830 --> 03:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and I have a conversation with them
 
03:52:45.290 --> 03:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
ahead of time I've got warnings all over
 
03:52:48.290 --> 03:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
the place and and all of that
 
03:52:51.050 --> 03:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't want to I don't want to
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
distract from the fact that
 
03:52:57.110 --> 03:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
um my use of it is religious
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire isn't all
 
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
going to come to my church
 
03:53:03.229 --> 03:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
right I I appreciate this bill because
 
03:53:05.150 --> 03:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to help me be a little bit
 
03:53:07.370 --> 03:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
more safe in my practice because I mean
 
03:53:09.050 --> 03:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
let's be honest what I'm doing is not
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
currently totally legal you know and I
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
understand that there might be some
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
repercussions of that I believe in my
 
03:53:17.150 --> 03:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
Sacrament so much I'm willing to risk
 
03:53:19.130 --> 03:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
that but there's other people in New
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other than me and people in my
 
03:53:22.070 --> 03:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
church and they should be able to
 
03:53:23.809 --> 03:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
explore their Consciousness they're not
 
03:53:29.269 --> 03:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.889 --> 03:53:30.899 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify the reason I'm asking
 
03:53:33.170 --> 03:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
that question is you know the bill is
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
very straightforward right the bill says
 
03:53:35.870 --> 03:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to exempt this from the
 
03:53:38.090 --> 03:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
control Drug Act so that means that it I
 
03:53:40.010 --> 03:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
mean that would uh if I'm correct that
 
03:53:42.410 --> 03:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
would make it completely legal for
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
anyone to use not through a medical
 
03:53:46.370 --> 03:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
professional or within the context of
 
03:53:46.380 --> 03:53:47.929 align:start position:0%
professional or within the context of
religion

03:53:47.929 --> 03:53:47.939 align:start position:0%
religion
 
03:53:50.030 --> 03:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
um or something like that and so uh what
 
03:53:52.010 --> 03:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm trying to get at is kind of
 
03:53:54.170 --> 03:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
the safety precautions that that you
 
03:53:57.050 --> 03:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
need to take and kind of how if it were
 
03:53:57.060 --> 03:53:58.490 align:start position:0%
need to take and kind of how if it were
legalized

03:53:58.490 --> 03:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
legalized
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
um kind of how would we ensure that
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
other people are able to take those
 
03:54:04.849 --> 03:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
precautions as well does that make sense
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand I understand I
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
understand where you're going for where
 
03:54:11.090 --> 03:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
you're coming from and um
 
03:54:12.830 --> 03:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think that any of those are
 
03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:13.910 align:start position:0%
I don't think that any of those are
necessary

03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:54:15.650 --> 03:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that those safety
 
03:54:18.050 --> 03:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
precautions are necessary
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
um with something like dimethotryptamine
 
03:54:23.689 --> 03:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
that that I can't find a single case of
 
03:54:27.410 --> 03:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
a death uh cigarettes cause 440 000
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
deaths a year in this country
 
03:54:30.600 --> 03:54:32.269 align:start position:0%
deaths a year in this country
um

03:54:32.269 --> 03:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:35.330 --> 03:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
the uh you know
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I I do it because I want to make
 
03:54:40.610 --> 03:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
people become feel safe because it is a
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
scary process what we do
 
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit different than what
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
people will be experiencing on the
 
03:54:45.600 --> 03:54:50.269 align:start position:0%
people will be experiencing on the
street

03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
03:54:53.450 --> 03:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Derek for your
 
03:54:56.570 --> 03:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
testimony I wondering what is the
 
03:54:59.570 --> 03:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
typical ceremony like at your church uh
 
03:55:01.969 --> 03:55:01.979 align:start position:0%
you mentioned just now that it was a
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
little bit more scary than it would be
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
like on the street what what does it
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
look like you said you had 5 000
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
experiences that you had witnessed so uh
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
right so we have uh an indigenous Shaman
 
03:55:16.010 --> 03:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
come to our church
 
03:55:20.570 --> 03:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
from Colombia Peru Brazil
 
03:55:24.349 --> 03:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
and Ayahuasca when you take Ayahuasca it
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
is a six hour very deep journey into
 
03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
traumas and
 
03:55:32.990 --> 03:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
um emotions that we've been hiding from
 
03:55:36.290 --> 03:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
right uh when you vaporize it and smoke
 
03:55:39.290 --> 03:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
it you kind of go to another world and
 
03:55:41.450 --> 03:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
you come back in about 10 minutes
 
03:55:45.170 --> 03:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
creates a very short and Powerful
 
03:55:45.180 --> 03:55:46.330 align:start position:0%
creates a very short and Powerful
experience

03:55:46.330 --> 03:55:46.340 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:55:48.650 --> 03:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
where the way that most people are going
 
03:55:51.050 --> 03:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
to take it at home uh when you come to
 
03:55:53.809 --> 03:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
our Sanctuary ours is a long process
 
03:55:56.150 --> 03:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
when you drink Ayahuasca tea it's
 
03:55:58.670 --> 03:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
between four and six hours sometimes
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
eight and ten but usually between four
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
and six hours
 
03:56:05.090 --> 03:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
um and it's you're very vulnerable for a
 
03:56:07.010 --> 03:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
long period of time
 
03:56:10.370 --> 03:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
so we have a staff of about 10 people to
 
03:56:11.870 --> 03:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're very cared for
 
03:56:13.570 --> 03:56:13.580 align:start position:0%
that you're safe that you're comfortable
 
03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
a nurse on staff and all that
 
03:56:19.610 --> 03:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's scary being vulnerable
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
and scary feeling feelings sometimes
 
03:56:24.239 --> 03:56:26.689 align:start position:0%
and scary feeling feelings sometimes

said because it was really good
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
information I'm also a minister with the
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
Shire Free Church I have some personal
 
03:58:27.050 --> 03:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
experience with using DMT for Spiritual
 
03:58:27.060 --> 03:58:28.550 align:start position:0%
experience with using DMT for Spiritual
reasons

03:58:28.550 --> 03:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:58:30.769 --> 03:58:30.779 align:start position:0%
and there was a very important Supreme
 
03:58:32.630 --> 03:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
Court decision there were a few National
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions that were
 
03:58:36.110 --> 03:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned here so far but I want to
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to a New Hampshire
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision it came out in
 
03:58:43.630 --> 03:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
December of 2020 it was a unanimous
 
03:58:46.490 --> 03:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
decision in the case of a gentleman who
 
03:58:49.969 --> 03:58:49.979 align:start position:0%
had been arrested for psilocybin which
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
is as you heard a related molecule
 
03:58:56.150 --> 03:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
and he was convicted at the Superior
 
03:58:59.689 --> 03:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
Court appealed his case and explained to
 
03:59:01.969 --> 03:59:01.979 align:start position:0%
the court the Supreme Court that this
 
03:59:04.990 --> 03:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
was his religious Sacrament
 
03:59:07.490 --> 03:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
and they said that the New Hampshire
 
03:59:07.500 --> 03:59:08.830 align:start position:0%
and they said that the New Hampshire
Constitution

03:59:08.830 --> 03:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely protects not just your right
 
03:59:14.650 --> 03:59:14.660 align:start position:0%
to religion which the U.S Constitution
 
03:59:16.250 --> 03:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
protects but the New Hampshire
 
03:59:18.650 --> 03:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
Constitution goes so far as to protect
 
03:59:21.410 --> 03:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
your right to worship
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the way that you choose and so with a
 
03:59:27.769 --> 03:59:27.779 align:start position:0%
full unanimous vote they overturned the
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
superior Court's conviction of this
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
gentleman and set him free
 
03:59:37.130 --> 03:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
so this bill would simply catch up to
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
where the courts have already set forth
 
03:59:43.130 --> 03:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
the courts have already said that the
 
03:59:45.969 --> 03:59:45.979 align:start position:0%
use of psychedelic
 
03:59:49.849 --> 03:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
substances is legal in New Hampshire for
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
Spiritual reasons
 
03:59:55.010 --> 03:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
but yet someone who is not using it for
 
03:59:56.689 --> 03:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
a spiritual reason or at least that's
 
03:59:58.849 --> 03:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
perhaps not their intention they may end
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
up deciding that it was a spiritual
 
04:00:02.570 --> 04:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
experience but if they were just using
 
04:00:05.090 --> 04:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
it for a recreational purpose I don't
 
04:00:07.610 --> 04:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
think that person needs to go to prison
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
they don't need to go to jail simply
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
because their intentions with this
 
04:00:14.090 --> 04:00:14.100 align:start position:0%
molecule were different so again this
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
bill would simply catch up legislatively
 
04:00:19.130 --> 04:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
to where we already are in the New
 
04:00:21.410 --> 04:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts that's all I had
 
04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions happy to take
 
04:00:22.920 --> 04:00:25.849 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions happy to take
them

04:00:25.849 --> 04:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:25.859 --> 04:00:29.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:33.469 --> 04:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned another substance
 
04:00:38.210 --> 04:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court said in New
 
04:00:41.210 --> 04:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court said was legal
 
04:00:43.150 --> 04:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
based on the New Hampshire Constitution
 
04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
after that ruling was that removed from
 
04:00:48.830 --> 04:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
the controlled drug list or is it still
 
04:00:50.570 --> 04:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
on the list right unfortunately been on
 
04:00:52.670 --> 04:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
the list oh yes it's absolutely on that
 
04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh that list unfortunately last year
 
04:00:56.290 --> 04:00:56.300 align:start position:0%
there was a bill that would have
 
04:00:59.030 --> 04:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
decriminalized uh psilocybin mushrooms
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
and it I don't think it made it out of
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee unfortunately as far as it was
 
04:01:04.969 --> 04:01:04.979 align:start position:0%
not given an
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
OTP it should have been because again
 
04:01:09.290 --> 04:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
this would that bill and this one would
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
have caught up legislatively to where
 
04:01:13.370 --> 04:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
this courts already are but usually the
 
04:01:15.229 --> 04:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
legislature as you know takes a long
 
04:01:17.450 --> 04:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
time to uh to get anything done that
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
should be done
 
04:01:20.689 --> 04:01:20.699 align:start position:0%
I didn't know that but thank you okay
 
04:01:23.090 --> 04:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
now you know
 
04:01:26.210 --> 04:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
I represent him no
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
real quick
 
04:01:29.090 --> 04:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I am not fully caught up in my email
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
I think I'm about 24 hours behind have
 
04:01:32.570 --> 04:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
you submitted that uh the Supreme Court
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
ruling the briefing because I think that
 
04:01:36.110 --> 04:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful uh no I haven't
 
04:01:38.030 --> 04:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to do that right
 
04:01:38.040 --> 04:01:41.030 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to do that right
all right sure

04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:52.510 --> 04:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:01.490 --> 04:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:03.469 --> 04:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
hello and thank you for being here to
 
04:02:05.630 --> 04:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
hear this testimony today
 
04:02:07.790 --> 04:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I had the Good Fortune to go to
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
college on the GI Bill and so the
 
04:02:11.809 --> 04:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
government paid for me to read books for
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
four years and one of those books was
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
the Epic of Gilgamesh which is the
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
oldest version of the hero's journey
 
04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
that we have in surviving texts
 
04:02:21.530 --> 04:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
something like five or six thousand
 
04:02:24.650 --> 04:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
years old and in that story the hero of
 
04:02:26.450 --> 04:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
the story goes through the flood of the
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
Bible but from a different perspective
 
04:02:34.250 --> 04:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
and he utilizes uh the drug that is
 
04:02:37.250 --> 04:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
Ayahuasca or DMT to Journey to the
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
spirit world and uh to resolve the
 
04:02:42.410 --> 04:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
personal issues that had made him a
 
04:02:45.950 --> 04:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
Tyrant King and allowed him to be a
 
04:02:48.050 --> 04:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
complete person and to rule his kingdom
 
04:02:50.210 --> 04:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
with Justice
 
04:02:50.220 --> 04:02:51.410 align:start position:0%
with Justice
um

04:02:51.410 --> 04:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:53.330 --> 04:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
this same chemical is found in the
 
04:02:55.250 --> 04:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
acacia Bush which is the burning bush
 
04:02:57.170 --> 04:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
that we know from the Bible that Moses
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
saw that allowed him to speak to God so
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
it is general knowledge that the purpose
 
04:03:07.370 --> 04:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
of this drug is to allow you to achieve
 
04:03:09.469 --> 04:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
a religious experience
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make that clear that's
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
something that I got out of my undergrad
 
04:03:15.290 --> 04:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
degree if anybody has any questions
 
04:03:17.570 --> 04:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
about these stories I don't know
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
anything about using the drug personally
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
but I could tell you about the meaning
 
04:03:23.570 --> 04:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
behind the stories I got the degree in
 
04:03:23.580 --> 04:03:29.889 align:start position:0%
behind the stories I got the degree in
it

04:03:29.889 --> 04:03:29.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you all
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes I believe it's
 
04:03:56.210 --> 04:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.199 --> 04:04:03.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:04:03.070 --> 04:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:06.469 --> 04:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
there's an incredible amount of medical
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
utility to this substance
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
to put it in recognizable terms it's
 
04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's dreams it literally exists in the
 
04:04:18.050 --> 04:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
pineal gland it's released in small
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
quantities during dreams large
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
quantities near during near-death
 
04:04:21.600 --> 04:04:23.450 align:start position:0%
quantities near during near-death
experiences

04:04:23.450 --> 04:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
04:04:23.460 --> 04:04:25.189 align:start position:0%
experiences
uh

04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:27.530 --> 04:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
you're making something illegal that you
 
04:04:29.150 --> 04:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
are all currently carrying around inside
 
04:04:31.370 --> 04:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
the middle of your head
 
04:04:35.150 --> 04:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.809 --> 04:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of people who
 
04:04:40.849 --> 04:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
bring their lives back together because
 
04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
they have some of this it
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
has tremendous effects on PTSD and we
 
04:04:49.130 --> 04:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
have a lot of veterans that could really
 
04:04:52.849 --> 04:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
use a bit more sanity
 
04:04:52.859 --> 04:04:53.990 align:start position:0%
use a bit more sanity
um

04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:56.689 --> 04:04:56.699 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly effective at treating
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
Other Drug addictions especially the the
 
04:05:02.929 --> 04:05:02.939 align:start position:0%
Opium epidemic that we have now could be
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.199 --> 04:05:10.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:05:10.490 --> 04:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.290 --> 04:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know which is more absurd the
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
fact that oh oh by the way it's in all
 
04:05:16.490 --> 04:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
your groceries like we'd have to put
 
04:05:19.010 --> 04:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
away every grocery store owner if we're
 
04:05:20.330 --> 04:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
going to actually enforce this it's
 
04:05:20.340 --> 04:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
going to actually enforce this it's
absurd

04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
absurd
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
the whole the thing about this molecule
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
it uh gets digested incredibly easy
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's why you have to do this specialty
 
04:05:32.210 --> 04:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
to get you to not digest the thing
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's in everything it's in everything
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:48.769 --> 04:05:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
I I did have one question you know given
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
oh sorry uh one more thing I wanted to
 
04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
do uh uh the uh illegalization as I
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
understand it it was uh uh
 
04:06:03.290 --> 04:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh in a swath of uh when LSD was put uh
 
04:06:05.950 --> 04:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh put on the uh on the drug list to um
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
they'd seen this massive social change
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
they're like clamped down on that what
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
are they doing LSD put that in there
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
what's this that's also uh one of these
 
04:06:18.050 --> 04:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh okay put those all on the on the list
 
04:06:20.689 --> 04:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh as I understand that's that was the
 
04:06:22.130 --> 04:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
only real thinking on this thing in the
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
first place sorry
 
04:06:25.080 --> 04:06:26.150 align:start position:0%
first place sorry
sure

04:06:26.150 --> 04:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:06:26.160 --> 04:06:28.130 align:start position:0%
sure
um

04:06:28.130 --> 04:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it it seems like
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
um the drug is manufactured
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
um maybe not by the people who use it
 
04:06:39.650 --> 04:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
but manufactured locally for the for the
 
04:06:42.410 --> 04:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
people who do who do use it
 
04:06:42.420 --> 04:06:43.250 align:start position:0%
people who do who do use it
um

04:06:43.250 --> 04:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:45.650 --> 04:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I'm I'm curious
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
about is
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
people like people who have addiction
 
04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
issues mental health issues PTSD issues
 
04:06:59.570 --> 04:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
taking a a powerful drug that
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you're taking the wrong
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
antidepressant has the risk of actually
 
04:07:04.189 --> 04:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
killing you
 
04:07:07.130 --> 04:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
outside of a clinical setting
 
04:07:07.140 --> 04:07:08.030 align:start position:0%
outside of a clinical setting
um

04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:11.450 --> 04:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
what is your ability to actually help
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
people who get into not just mental
 
04:07:18.610 --> 04:07:18.620 align:start position:0%
distress but actual physical distress
 
04:07:25.250 --> 04:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
what do you mean physical distress
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things we heard earlier was
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
there there actually is a risk of death
 
04:07:35.689 --> 04:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
due to a serotonin yeah it's uh you can
 
04:07:38.090 --> 04:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
overdose on it like very many substances
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
I mean enough water will kill you and
 
04:07:42.290 --> 04:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
that's the thing uh the the way that
 
04:07:44.450 --> 04:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's made uh there are two substances
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
one uh it has a heavy dose of this thing
 
04:07:48.769 --> 04:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
that's in everything and the other uh
 
04:07:51.769 --> 04:07:51.779 align:start position:0%
gets your body to not digest it so uh
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
the the drugs that you're referring to
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
are this side of it so you're just
 
04:07:59.689 --> 04:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
overdosing on it so it's like oh don't
 
04:08:02.269 --> 04:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh don't take a bunch of alcohol when
 
04:08:07.250 --> 04:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the difference between dosage
 
04:08:12.110 --> 04:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
between poison and medicine is always in
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:20.050 --> 04:08:20.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you answered my question
 
04:08:24.050 --> 04:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh uh what what how do how do
 
04:08:26.269 --> 04:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
you how are you prepared to actually
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
take care of people who may have an
 
04:08:30.889 --> 04:08:30.899 align:start position:0%
adverse physical reaction uh to the
 
04:08:30.899 --> 04:08:33.229 align:start position:0%
adverse physical reaction uh to the
chemical

04:08:33.229 --> 04:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:33.239 --> 04:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:08:38.450 --> 04:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
um well uh I I don't run a church uh for
 
04:08:38.460 --> 04:08:40.490 align:start position:0%
um well uh I I don't run a church uh for
this

04:08:40.490 --> 04:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:08:43.370 --> 04:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
um I I I will vouch for uh everything
 
04:08:45.229 --> 04:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
that's been said on that but
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so personally if I was going to and I
 
04:08:50.809 --> 04:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
I suspect that he probably has this uh
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
there are ways of diluting that effect
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh there are things you can take uh the
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
first thing I would be like okay get
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
them some water but like I'm I'm sure he
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
knows the chemistry far better than I do
 
04:09:04.490 --> 04:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
to uh tone this down
 
04:09:06.769 --> 04:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
so it would be yeah absolutely if you're
 
04:09:09.950 --> 04:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
going to run a business or a church that
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
does this it would be prudent to have
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
some on hand
 
04:09:13.680 --> 04:09:16.010 align:start position:0%
some on hand
but

04:09:16.010 --> 04:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:09:19.130 --> 04:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
any anything that you have too much of
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
is going to kill people and the thing
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
with this is because it's illegal it's
 
04:09:25.550 --> 04:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
not dosed out
 
04:09:27.950 --> 04:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
like it doesn't come in nice little
 
04:09:30.290 --> 04:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
here's your dosage because it hasn't
 
04:09:33.530 --> 04:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
been able to be put on shelves so we
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:38.279 --> 04:09:40.269 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:09:40.269 --> 04:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:09:43.070 --> 04:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
to aspirin if you take a bunch of
 
04:09:43.080 --> 04:09:44.570 align:start position:0%
to aspirin if you take a bunch of
aspirin

04:09:44.570 --> 04:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
aspirin
 
04:09:46.250 --> 04:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
yeah you'll you'll it'll be a blood
 
04:09:47.570 --> 04:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
thinner and if you're already on blood
 
04:09:52.929 --> 04:09:52.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.250 --> 04:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
04:09:57.410 --> 04:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
has this ever killed anyone
 
04:10:02.269 --> 04:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.680 --> 04:10:18.170 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:10:18.170 --> 04:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you members of
 
04:10:21.290 --> 04:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
the committee for hearing this bill
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Jason Gerhard I represent
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
Northfield Franklin Mayor Mike 25.
 
04:10:27.590 --> 04:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll keep this short
 
04:10:29.570 --> 04:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
we obviously are in the throes of a
 
04:10:32.210 --> 04:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
major opioid addiction
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
epidemic and the current
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
so let's put it this way a large
 
04:10:39.429 --> 04:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
proportion of people who are
 
04:10:41.450 --> 04:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
incarcerated suffer from addiction
 
04:10:42.889 --> 04:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
issues that should be kind of
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
self-evident the way of treating this is
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
by giving them other drugs so most
 
04:10:52.010 --> 04:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
namely Suboxone now Suboxone
 
04:10:54.590 --> 04:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
is an opioid blocker the problem is you
 
04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
can get high off of Suboxone
 
04:10:56.640 --> 04:10:59.150 align:start position:0%
can get high off of Suboxone
so

04:10:59.150 --> 04:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a mess it seems like
 
04:11:02.150 --> 04:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're substituting one thing for another
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
thing when we when we go into the
 
04:11:05.150 --> 04:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
Psychedelic Realm
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
people are taking this drug once
 
04:11:09.710 --> 04:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
and overcoming their addictions or at
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
least coming to con to confront the
 
04:11:13.010 --> 04:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
issues that drive them to their
 
04:11:15.170 --> 04:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
addictions which I think is key
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the dangers of this as
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
if it's somebody doing it every weekend
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
which just doesn't happen it's like
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
psilocybin with mushrooms you know it's
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
just not something that people do like
 
04:11:26.030 --> 04:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
that or if they do they're just burnt
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
out and they're going to be the same
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
people huffing paint I mean what are you
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
gonna do band paint so my point being is
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
that if we really want to deal with the
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
the addiction issues we have to kind of
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
look to something that's actually been
 
04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
used in the past to cure them
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
Nate just real quick Aldous Huxley back
 
04:11:41.929 --> 04:11:41.939 align:start position:0%
in the 1950s he wrote doors of
 
04:11:43.490 --> 04:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
perception that's actually where the
 
04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
band The Doors got their name from but
 
04:11:47.330 --> 04:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
in it he was talking about his masculine
 
04:11:49.610 --> 04:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
experience and other psychedelics and
 
04:11:51.290 --> 04:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter they banned all that
 
04:11:53.450 --> 04:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
and canceled all the research so we've
 
04:11:55.490 --> 04:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
kind of been in the Dark Ages
 
04:11:57.410 --> 04:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
of a lot of this stuff so at the very
 
04:12:00.290 --> 04:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
least if you guys do just decide to itl
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
this or whatever at least at least in
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
the future or somehow amend this somehow
 
04:12:06.910 --> 04:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
at least open up some kind of ability to
 
04:12:09.170 --> 04:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
investigate and start some trials at the
 
04:12:10.250 --> 04:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
state level so we can actually see
 
04:12:11.809 --> 04:12:11.819 align:start position:0%
what's really going on here we have
 
04:12:14.269 --> 04:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
plenty of people locked up why not you
 
04:12:15.410 --> 04:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
know I mean let's just try to figure out
 
04:12:16.670 --> 04:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
we got to do something because locking
 
04:12:18.410 --> 04:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
people app's not working we're gonna
 
04:12:19.610 --> 04:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
make stuff more illegal I mean it's
 
04:12:21.530 --> 04:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
already legal so it's like so anyway I'd
 
04:12:26.349 --> 04:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:12:31.490 --> 04:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:37.130 --> 04:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:40.130 --> 04:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:42.110 --> 04:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gonna try to touch on a few
 
04:12:45.889 --> 04:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
things and I will credential myself
 
04:12:48.290 --> 04:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
um I spent
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
five years in solitary confinement two
 
04:12:52.010 --> 04:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
and a half years for refusing to shave
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
my beard on religious grounds so I do
 
04:12:54.000 --> 04:12:55.910 align:start position:0%
my beard on religious grounds so I do
understand

04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:12:55.920 --> 04:12:56.510 align:start position:0%
understand
um

04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:59.689 --> 04:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment and what is it the
 
04:13:01.969 --> 04:13:01.979 align:start position:0%
what this gentleman should be referring
 
04:13:03.889 --> 04:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
to is not the first amendment because
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's less protective than
 
04:13:06.600 --> 04:13:07.189 align:start position:0%
it's less protective than
um

04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:09.769 --> 04:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
hours Article 5 is religious freedom
 
04:13:12.050 --> 04:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
recognized which Ian Freeman testified
 
04:13:15.889 --> 04:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
to protects the right to worship so I
 
04:13:19.130 --> 04:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
also understand the clinical concerns
 
04:13:21.370 --> 04:13:21.380 align:start position:0%
and I would recommend people to go to
 
04:13:23.530 --> 04:13:23.540 align:start position:0%
maps.org that's the multi
 
04:13:26.210 --> 04:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary Association for
 
04:13:29.090 --> 04:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
psychedelic studies it's a 501c3
 
04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
government funded they do a lot of PTSD
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
studies with all they're the ones doing
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
all this PTSD studies with the veterans
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
and drug addiction and stuff like that
 
04:13:43.729 --> 04:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually trained as psychedelic
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
peer support specialist uh I would
 
04:13:47.870 --> 04:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
suggest the gentleman putting forth the
 
04:13:49.969 --> 04:13:49.979 align:start position:0%
bill to have all his staff trained as
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
psychedelic peer support Specialists as
 
04:13:52.199 --> 04:13:53.389 align:start position:0%
psychedelic peer support Specialists as
well

04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
um if they're not already
 
04:13:58.189 --> 04:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh I he may have mentioned that I'm not
 
04:14:01.309 --> 04:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
sure I came in a little bit late but
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
I think there's a two-pronged approach
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
here and if this bill was to make
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
all substances
 
04:14:11.929 --> 04:14:11.939 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:14:14.389 --> 04:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
for religious purposes
 
04:14:16.450 --> 04:14:16.460 align:start position:0%
because it's that would cover everything
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
the mushrooms and all these other
 
04:14:21.050 --> 04:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
there's another one called ibogaine
 
04:14:23.389 --> 04:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
comes from the plant iboga this is
 
04:14:25.490 --> 04:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
specific to the opioid crisis and there
 
04:14:27.830 --> 04:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
is a contra indication with this one as
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
well you got to be careful and make sure
 
04:14:31.010 --> 04:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
you're not taking something that you're
 
04:14:33.050 --> 04:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
not supposed to like an SSRI when it
 
04:14:36.170 --> 04:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
comes to DMT but ibogaine is specific to
 
04:14:38.570 --> 04:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
the opioid crisis people take a dose of
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
this they go uh into you know a six hour
 
04:14:44.450 --> 04:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
they're in a closed room by themselves
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
they deal with all this trauma they come
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
out and they Nev it also kills any
 
04:14:51.889 --> 04:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
withdraws if you're having withdraws but
 
04:14:53.929 --> 04:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
withdraws immediately go away and then
 
04:14:56.689 --> 04:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
they come out and sometimes in six
 
04:14:58.849 --> 04:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
months they might do a revisit but most
 
04:15:00.889 --> 04:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
people take one dose of this ibogaine
 
04:15:02.929 --> 04:15:02.939 align:start position:0%
and it cures the opioid crisis I think
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
it was rep Murphy was wondering why
 
04:15:06.050 --> 04:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
isn't this stuff being used well it is
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
being tested and it is being used
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
because they are seeing how powerful it
 
04:15:12.050 --> 04:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
is the problem is Big Pharma
 
04:15:14.150 --> 04:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
is all they want to do is push bills
 
04:15:16.250 --> 04:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
that you have to take forever okay ever
 
04:15:19.130 --> 04:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
since the Opium Wars every cure has been
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
a stronger opioid
 
04:15:22.849 --> 04:15:22.859 align:start position:0%
okay they had opium then they created
 
04:15:25.250 --> 04:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
Morphine Morphine became Hydromorphone
 
04:15:27.650 --> 04:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
which is heroin and then it be you know
 
04:15:29.809 --> 04:15:29.819 align:start position:0%
methadone and all these had Fentanyl and
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's just a stronger and stronger opiate
 
04:15:35.210 --> 04:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
to cure the opioid crisis is not working
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
and we need to change that so
 
04:15:40.370 --> 04:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
if this bill was passed it would also
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
expand the clinical usage and the
 
04:15:49.849 --> 04:15:49.859 align:start position:0%
ability for clinicians to apply with
 
04:15:52.250 --> 04:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
maps and
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
um you know people should have the right
 
04:15:56.090 --> 04:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
to go through a clinician and get it
 
04:15:58.250 --> 04:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
done but they should also and they do
 
04:16:00.410 --> 04:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
have the right to go get it from his
 
04:16:02.809 --> 04:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
church or whatever and yeah there are
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
dangers there are people who hold
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
rattlesnakes and they're allowed to do
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
that right there are people who die in
 
04:16:10.729 --> 04:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
sweat lodges
 
04:16:13.130 --> 04:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
okay so these things happen and that's
 
04:16:15.290 --> 04:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
that's just that's a part of people's
 
04:16:17.929 --> 04:16:17.939 align:start position:0%
spiritual spirituality and
 
04:16:19.849 --> 04:16:19.859 align:start position:0%
um we have that right under the New
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Constitution Article Five
 
04:16:23.279 --> 04:16:24.590 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Constitution Article Five
um

04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:28.610 --> 04:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I do think that all drugs uh should
 
04:16:34.910 --> 04:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
be exempt from any religious practices
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
or just really streamline that and fall
 
04:16:39.490 --> 04:16:39.500 align:start position:0%
in line with the Supreme Court decision
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh there so
 
04:16:43.080 --> 04:16:44.450 align:start position:0%
uh there so
um

04:16:44.450 --> 04:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:49.729 --> 04:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'm also in I do work in the uh the
 
04:16:53.929 --> 04:16:53.939 align:start position:0%
recovery community on this local
 
04:16:56.269 --> 04:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
coordinator for smart recovery I operate
 
04:16:59.450 --> 04:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
Humble House LLC it's uh the only
 
04:17:04.250 --> 04:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.370 --> 04:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Newell
 
04:17:09.410 --> 04:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
hey Frank actually I think a memory just
 
04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
came up you and I speaking uh on a panel
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
together about substance use disorders
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes right I've spoken on a few people
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
recognize me
 
04:17:17.929 --> 04:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
um I was actually first going to say you
 
04:17:19.130 --> 04:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
know it would be good to say that so
 
04:17:20.090 --> 04:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
that people understand where you're
 
04:17:21.889 --> 04:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
coming from I appreciate that and given
 
04:17:25.010 --> 04:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
that I'm curious you know when you're
 
04:17:26.570 --> 04:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
talking about ending withdrawals and
 
04:17:29.210 --> 04:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
like its utility as a treatment in
 
04:17:31.790 --> 04:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder is that
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
um is that well I guess first of all
 
04:17:36.410 --> 04:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
is an opiate use disorder or all
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder that is good for
 
04:17:40.010 --> 04:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
and then second of all is that anecdotal
 
04:17:41.689 --> 04:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
or is there some type of reference to
 
04:17:43.729 --> 04:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
there are studies I would suggest going
 
04:17:45.410 --> 04:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
to maps.org and there are plenty of
 
04:17:46.729 --> 04:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
studies there you can look at all the
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
different ones look up ibogaine opioids
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
if you Google it I'm sure there'll be
 
04:17:54.290 --> 04:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
plenty of stuff that comes up uh it is
 
04:17:56.269 --> 04:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
used for other things smoking and
 
04:17:58.490 --> 04:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
alcohol as well but it particularly
 
04:18:01.969 --> 04:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
stops the withdrawals of opioids and you
 
04:18:03.410 --> 04:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
know people come out they've worked
 
04:18:06.050 --> 04:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
through all this past trauma without a
 
04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
therapist they've done it all in their
 
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
mind right like it's it's like a dream
 
04:18:11.150 --> 04:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
world that you go into and you're not
 
04:18:13.090 --> 04:18:13.100 align:start position:0%
you're not a danger to yourself
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
you can go and get these treatments I
 
04:18:17.929 --> 04:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
know a guy a friend of mine he's got the
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
money took him five thousand dollars he
 
04:18:22.130 --> 04:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
had to go to Mexico to get iboga
 
04:18:24.349 --> 04:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
treatment he was doing like five grams
 
04:18:26.990 --> 04:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
of heroin a day you know and he went and
 
04:18:28.729 --> 04:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
he did this iBook of treatment and it
 
04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
worked but most people and especially
 
04:18:33.290 --> 04:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
the homeless people they can't do that
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
and you can easily you can get this
 
04:18:37.729 --> 04:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
iboga in the ibogaine it's readily
 
04:18:39.410 --> 04:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
available it comes from Plants we can
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
make it we can Mass produce it people
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
can produce it on their own and we can
 
04:18:45.050 --> 04:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
really get to the heart of this issue
 
04:18:48.889 --> 04:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
but again it's big Pharma and these
 
04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
lobbyists who are keeping this stuff
 
04:18:55.849 --> 04:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.130 --> 04:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
it's all about billing Insurance even
 
04:18:59.929 --> 04:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
the recovery Community these recovery
 
04:19:02.450 --> 04:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
houses they send people into into
 
04:19:04.849 --> 04:19:04.859 align:start position:0%
treatment then they come out I volunteer
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
I hope for New Hampshire I think I
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned smart recovery I asked them
 
04:19:10.010 --> 04:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
what tools did they learn you were you
 
04:19:12.530 --> 04:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
were in rehab for 30 days six months 90
 
04:19:14.570 --> 04:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
days whatever it was they have they
 
04:19:16.010 --> 04:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
weren't taught anything they go to these
 
04:19:17.870 --> 04:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
me these little group meetings and
 
04:19:19.969 --> 04:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
individual meetings and they're they get
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
build Insurance build Insurance build
 
04:19:23.809 --> 04:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
insurance they get sent out put in and
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
then cycled back through
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's disgusting it's absolutely
 
04:19:29.450 --> 04:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
disgusting and all the money's getting
 
04:19:32.450 --> 04:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
funneled through this uh you know this
 
04:19:34.610 --> 04:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
recovery Housing Coalition they got to
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
certify these houses so all the money
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
can get funneled to these houses that's
 
04:19:40.490 --> 04:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
a conspiracy too and that's not okay
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's all you know one hand wash and
 
04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
the other these people doing doing
 
04:19:46.610 --> 04:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
favors for their friends and are we
 
04:19:48.530 --> 04:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem are we trying
 
04:19:50.689 --> 04:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
to line everybody's pockets that's the
 
04:19:50.699 --> 04:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
to line everybody's pockets that's the
question

04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.110 --> 04:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:17.050 --> 04:20:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Bonnie Freeman and I am
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
a minister at the Shire Free Church as
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
well and I just think it's interesting
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
that Forest speakers including myself so
 
04:20:29.450 --> 04:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
far have all been Ministers of some sort
 
04:20:32.030 --> 04:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's interesting because I was
 
04:20:34.610 --> 04:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
actually an atheist for a long time and
 
04:20:36.590 --> 04:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
Minister holdren I'm not part of his
 
04:20:38.150 --> 04:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
church or anything I was just talking to
 
04:20:39.769 --> 04:20:39.779 align:start position:0%
him and he was I would consider it
 
04:20:41.809 --> 04:20:41.819 align:start position:0%
ministering to me
 
04:20:43.370 --> 04:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
um really helped me to realize that even
 
04:20:45.250 --> 04:20:45.260 align:start position:0%
though I just I didn't believe anymore
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
in a god up in the sky judging
 
04:20:50.090 --> 04:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
everything I did because I grew up
 
04:20:52.490 --> 04:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
Christian then I broke away from that
 
04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
um didn't mean that I hadn't seen any
 
04:20:56.570 --> 04:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
evidence of God before and I just had to
 
04:20:59.210 --> 04:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
think of him differently sort of
 
04:21:00.889 --> 04:21:00.899 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to put that out there
 
04:21:02.689 --> 04:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
because I think it's interesting all of
 
04:21:05.210 --> 04:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
us have had experiences with this
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
molecule DMT and it helped us it helped
 
04:21:11.630 --> 04:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
open our eyes well I can speak for
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
myself in this part it helped open my
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
eyes to a loving
 
04:21:19.849 --> 04:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
presence that's out there and also in
 
04:21:19.859 --> 04:21:21.469 align:start position:0%
presence that's out there and also in
everyone

04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:21:21.479 --> 04:21:22.250 align:start position:0%
everyone
um

04:21:22.250 --> 04:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
that I call God
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to throw that I thought
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
that was interesting uh basically I take
 
04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
DMT once in a while and uh the
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
government making it illegal in 1970 to
 
04:21:36.469 --> 04:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
answer your question doesn't stop me all
 
04:21:38.510 --> 04:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
it does is put me at risk for harm by
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
the hand of the government by utilizing
 
04:21:42.110 --> 04:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
my natural rights to put into my body
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
whatever I want
 
04:21:45.229 --> 04:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to stop me so the
 
04:21:46.969 --> 04:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
laws against it are at the very least
 
04:21:46.979 --> 04:21:48.769 align:start position:0%
laws against it are at the very least
that

04:21:48.769 --> 04:21:48.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:51.290 --> 04:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
um at the very least not effective
 
04:21:54.290 --> 04:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
I've been diagnosed with PTSD and I work
 
04:21:56.210 --> 04:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
with my dreams a lot and almost two
 
04:21:57.769 --> 04:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
years after the incident that gave me
 
04:22:00.290 --> 04:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
PSD I have dreams that I interpret as my
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
brain still trying to understand what
 
04:22:04.729 --> 04:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
happens to me but during
 
04:22:07.610 --> 04:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
um like a time that I took DMT
 
04:22:10.370 --> 04:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
I've I mean I wouldn't say that it cured
 
04:22:12.290 --> 04:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
me but it's helped me to change my
 
04:22:14.450 --> 04:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
perspective on what's happened and even
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
look at the people who are persecuting
 
04:22:19.610 --> 04:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
me in my church and my husband
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
with love like the people that I should
 
04:22:24.769 --> 04:22:24.779 align:start position:0%
should want to hate like it's helped me
 
04:22:27.290 --> 04:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
change my perspective
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and realize basically
 
04:22:32.330 --> 04:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
um well I've only taken it uh in the
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
vaporized way I've never taken Ayahuasca
 
04:22:36.889 --> 04:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
so that's a big distinction I've never
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
taken a six hour trip and I don't even
 
04:22:42.650 --> 04:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
think I would have uh would describe
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
what has happened to me on DMT as the
 
04:22:47.570 --> 04:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
furthest that you can go which like
 
04:22:49.849 --> 04:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
people call it blasting off I don't
 
04:22:51.410 --> 04:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
think that that's happened to me I
 
04:22:53.090 --> 04:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to explain in just real terms
 
04:22:56.150 --> 04:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
what it's like it's like
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
um you take it and you start to feel
 
04:23:00.530 --> 04:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
really nice right away like you you
 
04:23:02.929 --> 04:23:02.939 align:start position:0%
don't feel nervous I've told some other
 
04:23:05.090 --> 04:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
ministers of mine that were thinking
 
04:23:06.290 --> 04:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
about taking it and then did take it
 
04:23:10.130 --> 04:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
because I recommended it as a sacrament
 
04:23:12.769 --> 04:23:12.779 align:start position:0%
that with marijuana which a lot of
 
04:23:15.290 --> 04:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
people are way more uh familiar with you
 
04:23:16.849 --> 04:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
can easily just start to feel nervous
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
and you don't get that with DMT you just
 
04:23:22.370 --> 04:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
it feels like somebody is there just
 
04:23:24.050 --> 04:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
giving you like a
 
04:23:25.729 --> 04:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to explain it except
 
04:23:27.950 --> 04:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
for that you feel very relaxed and nice
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't get all crazy and
 
04:23:32.150 --> 04:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
feel like you're out of your mind or
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable when you're taking in
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
the vaporized form I've never
 
04:23:38.450 --> 04:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
experienced ayahuasca
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
um but basically you just start to think
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
of things differently and maybe you'll
 
04:23:45.110 --> 04:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
see beautiful patterns um usually that
 
04:23:46.610 --> 04:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
only happens to me when I close my eyes
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
so it's not like if I have my eyes open
 
04:23:50.570 --> 04:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
I would be seeing a pattern but I know
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
people that that does happen to them
 
04:23:53.279 --> 04:23:54.110 align:start position:0%
people that that does happen to them
um

04:23:54.110 --> 04:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:57.650 --> 04:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
but things will look different and feel
 
04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
different so in a dream a real dream
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
when you're sleeping you can kind of
 
04:24:04.729 --> 04:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
know a thing and that will happen to you
 
04:24:06.769 --> 04:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
while you're awake like my dog I have a
 
04:24:08.929 --> 04:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
Chihuahua came up to me
 
04:24:11.570 --> 04:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
and um while I'm just in the middle of
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
this and he comes up to me is just
 
04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
looking at me right in the face
 
04:24:18.769 --> 04:24:18.779 align:start position:0%
and I just knew that he was just saying
 
04:24:20.689 --> 04:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
that he loved me it sounds kind of weird
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
but in a dream something like that could
 
04:24:24.590 --> 04:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
happen and it's just like that it senses
 
04:24:25.969 --> 04:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
that you don't have
 
04:24:28.370 --> 04:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
in your regular waking state that you
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
have access to on DMT and I just want to
 
04:24:32.570 --> 04:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
say that because I felt like a lot of
 
04:24:34.250 --> 04:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
people were kind of talking about it in
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
a really
 
04:24:38.210 --> 04:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
um around the subject kind of way just
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to explain exactly what it's like
 
04:24:41.450 --> 04:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's not like being on marijuana where
 
04:24:43.450 --> 04:24:43.460 align:start position:0%
everything is silly and you feel
 
04:24:45.650 --> 04:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
paranoid and you your heart rate's
 
04:24:46.910 --> 04:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
beating really hard you feel very
 
04:24:48.769 --> 04:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
comfortable at the most I feel a little
 
04:24:50.450 --> 04:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
heavy like
 
04:24:52.729 --> 04:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
sitting down feels nice
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for sharing with us
 
04:25:03.530 --> 04:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:03.540 --> 04:25:04.929 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:25:04.929 --> 04:25:04.939 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:25:07.729 --> 04:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes Captain
 
04:25:18.229 --> 04:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:20.030 --> 04:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much committee for
 
04:25:22.189 --> 04:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony my name is Bill
 
04:25:23.389 --> 04:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
bright I'm a captain with the New
 
04:25:24.550 --> 04:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police
 
04:25:27.729 --> 04:25:27.739 align:start position:0%
and this bill as it's proposed to
 
04:25:30.170 --> 04:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
legalize DMT
 
04:25:30.180 --> 04:25:31.790 align:start position:0%
legalize DMT
um

04:25:31.790 --> 04:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:34.070 --> 04:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
Our concern is obviously with the public
 
04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
safety of
 
04:25:37.849 --> 04:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the State of New
 
04:25:39.889 --> 04:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the it's classified as a
 
04:25:41.630 --> 04:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
hallucinogenic drug as it has been
 
04:25:44.330 --> 04:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
testified to this is also a schedule one
 
04:25:48.110 --> 04:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
drug uh which makes it illegal federally
 
04:25:48.120 --> 04:25:48.710 align:start position:0%
drug uh which makes it illegal federally
um

04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
Our concern would be that with it more
 
04:25:52.250 --> 04:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
readily available to the public there
 
04:25:54.950 --> 04:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
would be more widespread use which would
 
04:25:58.130 --> 04:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
lead to more impaired drivers more
 
04:26:02.530 --> 04:26:02.540 align:start position:0%
access to children and not necessarily
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
for the people who who are taking it but
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
for the others that may be affected uh
 
04:26:11.870 --> 04:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
as a result of their use of this drug so
 
04:26:13.969 --> 04:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
for those reasons we would oppose the
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.250 --> 04:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
so to the fact of people driving is
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
there a test to determine if this is in
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
their system how much is in their system
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
and are they Under the Influence why
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
they're driving uh it would be just
 
04:26:35.149 --> 04:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
regular impairment that an officer would
 
04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
be able to detect
 
04:26:39.950 --> 04:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
um but as far as a test to determine uh
 
04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
this drug other than a drug recognition
 
04:26:45.050 --> 04:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
expert doing an evaluation I'm not a
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
drug recognition expert so I can't
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
testify to what those indicators would
 
04:26:50.929 --> 04:26:50.939 align:start position:0%
be that would help them determine what
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
type of drug a person is on but other
 
04:26:55.370 --> 04:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
than that no there's no test that I know
 
04:26:55.380 --> 04:27:00.050 align:start position:0%
than that no there's no test that I know
of

04:27:02.210 --> 04:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
representative selling
 
04:27:04.670 --> 04:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
04:27:07.550 --> 04:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm I'm curious if the law as
 
04:27:10.429 --> 04:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
written were amended to say that it was
 
04:27:11.570 --> 04:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:27:11.580 --> 04:27:12.349 align:start position:0%
to be
um

04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:14.330 --> 04:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
removed from the controlled Drug Act
 
04:27:16.910 --> 04:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
explicitly in for clinical or religious
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
settings would that
 
04:27:21.170 --> 04:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
make any difference to the perspective
 
04:27:22.610 --> 04:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering like
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
perspective wise if it's used in in like
 
04:27:28.010 --> 04:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
a set safe Zone type of thing does that
 
04:27:31.250 --> 04:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
change the nature as with any Amendment
 
04:27:32.809 --> 04:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
or any Bill we would have to take a look
 
04:27:34.610 --> 04:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
at the at the wording and and make a
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
judgment call at that time so I'm I'm
 
04:27:41.229 --> 04:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.969 --> 04:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
Captain if you could tell us are you
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
aware um is this readily available now I
 
04:27:48.769 --> 04:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
mean is it is there a black market for
 
04:27:50.450 --> 04:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
it currently available
 
04:27:52.849 --> 04:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
this is nothing that I've come across uh
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
in my career to my knowledge it's not I
 
04:27:58.250 --> 04:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's not seen often obviously there's
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
been testimony that it is available in
 
04:28:04.189 --> 04:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
um in different forms but it is not
 
04:28:05.689 --> 04:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
something that I've come across uh
 
04:28:07.550 --> 04:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
personally and I don't know of any uh
 
04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
current current cases thank you

04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
bright
 
04:28:14.880 --> 04:28:15.950 align:start position:0%
bright
um

04:28:15.950 --> 04:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:19.010 --> 04:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
how many people are pulled over per year
 
04:28:20.809 --> 04:28:20.819 align:start position:0%
if you could follow up with this number
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
if you don't know it off the top of your
 
04:28:22.199 --> 04:28:23.030 align:start position:0%
if you don't know it off the top of your
head

04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
head
 
04:28:25.010 --> 04:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
um in regards to who are high on
 
04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
hallucinogens I'm not aware of those
 
04:28:30.170 --> 04:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
statistics I can look into that uh for
 
04:28:31.990 --> 04:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
you if you if you would like
 
04:28:34.010 --> 04:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
anecdotally would you say a lot of
 
04:28:36.349 --> 04:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman sorry still
 
04:28:37.849 --> 04:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
getting used to this
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
um anecdotally would you say that there
 
04:28:42.050 --> 04:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people who are pulled over
 
04:28:45.530 --> 04:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
who are on a hallucinogenic substance
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
um well as you know I mean an officer
 
04:28:49.610 --> 04:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
won't be able to determine that at the
 
04:28:50.990 --> 04:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
time that they pull somebody over they
 
04:28:53.450 --> 04:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
would be looking for impairment
 
04:28:57.110 --> 04:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
um that the numbers I I'm not aware of I
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many people are pulled
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
over for hallucinogenics I can look into
 
04:29:04.130 --> 04:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
that for you though
 
04:29:04.140 --> 04:29:07.750 align:start position:0%
that for you though
foreign

04:29:07.750 --> 04:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
I think your objection as I hear it is
 
04:29:13.849 --> 04:29:13.859 align:start position:0%
the same as your objection to marijuana
 
04:29:16.790 --> 04:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's what the effects of driving is it
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
not I don't see any other issues that
 
04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
you've raised well there could be there
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
could be many other
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
um effects as far as it's my
 
04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that a person who uh is
 
04:29:29.630 --> 04:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
under impairment of this drug
 
04:29:32.929 --> 04:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
specifically that it's unpredictable
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
High I guess so to speak like no I I
 
04:29:36.830 --> 04:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe that anybody knows how
 
04:29:39.710 --> 04:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to affect them ahead of time
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
um or or how long or anything like that
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
so A person who is under the influence
 
04:29:47.809 --> 04:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
of say this drug for an extended period
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
of time may come across many different
 
04:29:51.649 --> 04:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
situations and in an altered state of
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
mind we would be concerned about the
 
04:29:55.370 --> 04:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
safety for them and for other
 
04:29:56.929 --> 04:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
individuals that they come in contact
 
04:29:59.809 --> 04:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
with while they're under the influence
 
04:30:05.450 --> 04:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:07.790 --> 04:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
or because I don't know
 
04:30:09.530 --> 04:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:30:12.110 --> 04:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
um could you speak to uh you know I
 
04:30:13.849 --> 04:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
guess the implications of it being of
 
04:30:15.530 --> 04:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
course federally it's a schedule it's
 
04:30:17.210 --> 04:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
you schedule one drug
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
um if it were legalized um as written
 
04:30:22.670 --> 04:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh in the state what would be the
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
implications of it being federally
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
illegal and legal in the state a person
 
04:30:28.849 --> 04:30:28.859 align:start position:0%
would still be subject to the federal
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
penalties if they were charged federally
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
for uh possession can I follow up
 
04:30:36.290 --> 04:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay so you're here on behalf of the
 
04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
State Police right so State Police you
 
04:30:41.809 --> 04:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
know that's under State jurisdiction so
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
if it were a federal law enforcement
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
um dealt with federally and um that's
 
04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
correct or if if the federal if the
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
federal law was was broken they could be
 
04:30:58.490 --> 04:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:02.450 --> 04:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Captain thank you
 
04:31:04.250 --> 04:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
04:31:07.010 --> 04:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
on this bill who has not done so
 
04:31:07.020 --> 04:31:09.410 align:start position:0%
on this bill who has not done so
ah

04:31:09.410 --> 04:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
ah
 
04:31:11.630 --> 04:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
I was just uh Derek informed me he has
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
additional testimony to clear a few
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
things up and I just ask his Kersey he's
 
04:31:17.450 --> 04:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
the expert that I asked to be here for
 
04:31:17.460 --> 04:31:18.349 align:start position:0%
the expert that I asked to be here for
this

04:31:18.349 --> 04:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:31:19.729 --> 04:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
um so I think his testimony would be
 
04:31:21.649 --> 04:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
extremely valuable he would allow that
 
04:31:23.450 --> 04:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
um actually I I'm late for my next bill
 
04:31:25.070 --> 04:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
so I will not allow that but I would
 
04:31:27.229 --> 04:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
welcome him to email us with and if he
 
04:31:29.090 --> 04:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to rebut what he heard uh
 
04:31:30.290 --> 04:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
generally we don't take for a bottle
 
04:31:32.809 --> 04:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
testimony so I'd be happy to um you can
 
04:31:34.130 --> 04:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
email the whole committee and we would
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at it
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.370 --> 04:31:46.380 align:start position:0%

restore my rights a year ago
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
current law prevents my second amendment
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
rights from being restored so long as I
 
04:33:39.890 --> 04:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
owe restitution
 
04:33:42.289 --> 04:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
I am off parole and have satisfied my
 
04:33:44.510 --> 04:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
sentence police revised the law to allow
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
non-violent felon Second Amendment
 
04:33:48.170 --> 04:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
restoration upon completion of their
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
sentence we shouldn't have to pay a
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
lawyer six thousand dollars to
 
04:33:53.929 --> 04:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
accomplish a constitutional right
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
it was unknown to me until very recently
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's actually a cottage industry in
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:34:01.010 --> 04:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
where we have attorneys that help people
 
04:34:02.510 --> 04:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
get their gun rights back through the
 
04:34:05.090 --> 04:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
annulment process and so forth
 
04:34:08.090 --> 04:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
so there's obviously some opposition to
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
this bill on that ground which I can
 
04:34:13.010 --> 04:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
understand but point being is
 
04:34:15.170 --> 04:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
if someone is done with their sentence
 
04:34:16.849 --> 04:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
and they qualify on the annulment
 
04:34:18.890 --> 04:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
situation we already have on in state
 
04:34:20.689 --> 04:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
law I see no reason why we should have
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
to file a bunch of paperwork expend a
 
04:34:23.869 --> 04:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
lot of money in order to defend
 
04:34:25.730 --> 04:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
ourselves and our families we already
 
04:34:27.890 --> 04:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
have the Second Amendment right oh sorry
 
04:34:29.570 --> 04:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
not Second Amendment New Hampshire but
 
04:34:31.310 --> 04:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
we have the right to bear arms protect
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves and our property and so I'm
 
04:34:37.070 --> 04:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
ex-filing myself non-violent
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
I served 12 and a half years
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'm about to be done with probation here
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
in a little bit a couple weeks and I
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
just it's hard for me to understand how
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
we can have a state representative this
 
04:34:49.551 --> 04:34:49.561 align:start position:0%
is my situation obviously but we can
 
04:34:50.810 --> 04:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
have a state representative who cannot
 
04:34:52.609 --> 04:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
defend himself so if I'm going out into
 
04:34:54.529 --> 04:34:54.539 align:start position:0%
the parking garage late at night
 
04:34:56.330 --> 04:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
and somebody else you know hates sweet
 
04:34:57.709 --> 04:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
cheeks I'm just you know I'm just joking
 
04:34:59.689 --> 04:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
around but if somebody is there's no way
 
04:35:01.250 --> 04:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
for me to defend myself I mean I have a
 
04:35:03.949 --> 04:35:03.959 align:start position:0%
knife but come on and it just it just
 
04:35:05.390 --> 04:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me especially
 
04:35:06.590 --> 04:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
now also we have women and that's
 
04:35:09.650 --> 04:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
another thing with single mothers and I
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's just so hard for me to
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
explain everything in the sense of the
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
absurdity of it all if you're done with
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
your sentence and you're non-violent you
 
04:35:20.689 --> 04:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
have no predispositions of violence it
 
04:35:22.609 --> 04:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
what are we doing really all we're doing
 
04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
is funneling people into the court
 
04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
system with the pay obscene amounts of
 
04:35:27.890 --> 04:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
money in order to regain a right that
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
they were born with
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
um the last point
 
04:35:35.631 --> 04:35:35.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.641 --> 04:35:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:41.689 --> 04:35:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:47.390 --> 04:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:48.890 --> 04:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
I would just I just think that it's
 
04:35:50.689 --> 04:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
important to recognize everybody's life
 
04:35:53.150 --> 04:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
as equal and I just don't see why we
 
04:35:54.830 --> 04:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
should say that you have the ability to
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
defend yourself and you don't especially
 
04:35:59.150 --> 04:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
when these people have shown no no
 
04:36:01.070 --> 04:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
violence towards anyone else I just I
 
04:36:02.330 --> 04:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm just confused about this
 
04:36:04.250 --> 04:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
whole thing so any questions I'd
 
04:36:05.869 --> 04:36:05.879 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I did have more to say but
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
I'm getting tripped up now so I'd
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
04:36:13.010 --> 04:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you um what is your understanding
 
04:36:14.810 --> 04:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:36:17.449 --> 04:36:17.459 align:start position:0%
we have these two two tiers the the
 
04:36:17.459 --> 04:36:18.369 align:start position:0%
we have these two two tiers the the
federal

04:36:18.369 --> 04:36:18.379 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:36:21.170 --> 04:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
prohibition on felons possessing
 
04:36:23.810 --> 04:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
firearms versus the state in other words
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
if you if you were you're asking for us
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
to take care of the state portion of it
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
and you're understanding with that would
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
that get rid of the federal part too
 
04:36:35.330 --> 04:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
no I'm as far as I'm concerned the
 
04:36:36.529 --> 04:36:36.539 align:start position:0%
state's sovereign
 
04:36:39.289 --> 04:36:39.299 align:start position:0%
as other people and I
 
04:36:40.670 --> 04:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
I'll deal with the federal part of this
 
04:36:42.289 --> 04:36:42.299 align:start position:0%
let's put it that way I'll I have
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
another bill in to deal with any gun
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
made within the confines of Mont uh I
 
04:36:47.090 --> 04:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
keep saying Montana that's where the law
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
originated in 2008 any gun made within
 
04:36:50.330 --> 04:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
the confines of the State of New
 
04:36:51.289 --> 04:36:51.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not subject to Federal
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the interstate commerce
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
clause has been extended to Encompass
 
04:36:56.810 --> 04:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
everything the whole game is concentrate
 
04:36:59.150 --> 04:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
power in DC which I think is really
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
detrimental to everybody in the state
 
04:37:02.209 --> 04:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
especially considering article 7 State
 
04:37:03.650 --> 04:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
sovereignty but
 
04:37:05.330 --> 04:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers the question it
 
04:37:12.849 --> 04:37:12.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.209 --> 04:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:20.209 --> 04:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
violent crime and drugs go together and
 
04:37:21.709 --> 04:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
I don't think I could find myself
 
04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
supporting this if unless you we amended
 
04:37:29.650 --> 04:37:29.660 align:start position:0%
it to include uh non-violent or to
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
considered drugs as a violent crime
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh if you're talking about embezzlement
 
04:37:36.890 --> 04:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
I don't the objection to that but do you
 
04:37:41.209 --> 04:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
have any how do you feel about uh the
 
04:37:41.219 --> 04:37:42.789 align:start position:0%
have any how do you feel about uh the
include

04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
include
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
considering drugs as a violent crime and
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
by the way your probation lasts two
 
04:37:51.170 --> 04:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
years okay got elected for two
 
04:37:53.090 --> 04:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
oh oh you're saying stay yeah I was like
 
04:37:54.051 --> 04:37:54.061 align:start position:0%
hold on no
 
04:37:56.570 --> 04:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
um as far as drugs go I think we'd be
 
04:37:58.570 --> 04:37:58.580 align:start position:0%
Crossing into a very dangerous territory
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
so let's go back to my whole little
 
04:38:02.929 --> 04:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
prison stint
 
04:38:02.939 --> 04:38:05.090 align:start position:0%
prison stint
um

04:38:05.090 --> 04:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:07.730 --> 04:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do with alcoholics
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do with people
 
04:38:11.810 --> 04:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
huffing paint propane I didn't even know
 
04:38:13.310 --> 04:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
people have propane I found out when I
 
04:38:14.449 --> 04:38:14.459 align:start position:0%
was campaigning in Franklin somebody
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
told me somebody exploded down the
 
04:38:18.410 --> 04:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
street years ago on it but we have
 
04:38:20.449 --> 04:38:20.459 align:start position:0%
there's just so many there's so many
 
04:38:22.010 --> 04:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
addictions that
 
04:38:24.170 --> 04:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
to just try to say okay these illegal
 
04:38:26.269 --> 04:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
drugs like we just heard on DMT we just
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
heard that so if somebody gets caught
 
04:38:29.689 --> 04:38:29.699 align:start position:0%
with DMT we're going to take their right
 
04:38:30.890 --> 04:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
to defend themselves and their families
 
04:38:32.570 --> 04:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
away from them now you can say well they
 
04:38:33.890 --> 04:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
could be violent there's a lot of things
 
04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
that could happen you're a man you could
 
04:38:38.810 --> 04:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
be violent in the right circumstances I
 
04:38:40.131 --> 04:38:40.141 align:start position:0%
think we need to judge people by what
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
they have done not what they could do or
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
might happen in the future it's just you
 
04:38:45.170 --> 04:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
don't try to get at it just gets very
 
04:38:46.970 --> 04:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
dangerous for instance marijuana is
 
04:38:48.410 --> 04:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
considered the most dangerous thing ever
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
and now recently look at Colorado
 
04:38:52.369 --> 04:38:52.379 align:start position:0%
everybody just kind of gave it up on
 
04:38:54.170 --> 04:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
except for New Hampshire but they just
 
04:38:55.849 --> 04:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
kind of realized the writing on the wall
 
04:38:57.890 --> 04:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
and just kind of accepted what it is I
 
04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
know if that's answering a question
 
04:39:00.890 --> 04:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
exactly but I just don't want to delve
 
04:39:02.090 --> 04:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
into that territory because it just
 
04:39:04.010 --> 04:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
seems like a tomorrow if marijuana is
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
legalized what are we going to do now
 
04:39:15.609 --> 04:39:15.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.051 --> 04:39:18.061 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative thank you
 
04:39:20.449 --> 04:39:20.459 align:start position:0%

04:39:22.250 --> 04:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
um this point the chair calls
 
04:39:34.369 --> 04:39:34.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.109 --> 04:39:36.119 align:start position:0%

friend up here representative scitex

going to understand what I'm about to
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
make as an argument
 
04:39:50.770 --> 04:39:50.780 align:start position:0%
we do have a lot of non-violent felonies
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
if you pull up the chapter on
 
04:39:55.490 --> 04:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
occupational licensure
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%

04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay if I do engineering and I do it
 
04:40:10.368 --> 04:40:10.378 align:start position:0%
under an end a DBA it's no longer a
 
04:40:13.550 --> 04:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
natural person it falls under right a

04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
another entity which means instead of a
 
04:40:19.730 --> 04:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level offense it's a class B
 
04:40:19.740 --> 04:40:22.730 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level offense it's a class B

coalition to talk about long term we've
 
04:40:35.448 --> 04:40:35.458 align:start position:0%
misused the term felony in a lot of our
 
04:40:37.610 --> 04:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
statutes this may be a Band-Aid to start
 
04:40:39.288 --> 04:40:39.298 align:start position:0%
fixing that the correct thing would be
 
04:40:42.050 --> 04:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
to write use felony for violent level
 
04:40:42.060 --> 04:40:44.150 align:start position:0%

04:40:46.130 --> 04:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
we don't we use it for a lot of things
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
an occupational licensure is the one
 
04:40:50.090 --> 04:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
place and I can send the committee the
 
04:40:51.948 --> 04:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
list of places it shows up between
 
04:40:55.250 --> 04:40:55.260 align:start position:0%

04:40:55.260 --> 04:40:56.390 align:start position:0%
section 308 and 322 there's a lot of
them

04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:40:59.208 --> 04:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
um as a penalty
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
citizens should not be denied their
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
natural and constitutional rights
 
04:41:03.000 --> 04:41:04.730 align:start position:0%
natural and constitutional rights
because

04:41:04.730 --> 04:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
of archaic and complicated laws and
 
04:41:11.448 --> 04:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
something as simple as a failure to pay
 
04:41:14.448 --> 04:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollar licensing fee
 
04:41:16.850 --> 04:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
right if prosecuted rarely does that
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
happen but if prosecuted could put you
 
04:41:21.530 --> 04:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
in jail so with that I'll close my
 
04:41:21.540 --> 04:41:25.128 align:start position:0%

the federal firearm statute

this is a frequently litigated issue
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
this comes from 1435 post-conviction
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
restoration of civil rights this is
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
federal a frequently litigated issue
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
under 922 G1 is whether a convicted
 
04:42:40.990 --> 04:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
felon is exempt from the prohibition
 
04:42:43.910 --> 04:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
prohibitions of the statute because of a
 
04:42:46.610 --> 04:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
post-conviction restoration of civil
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
rights under state law in accordance
 
04:42:51.310 --> 04:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
with 18 USC
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
921 921a20 which gives an exemption if a
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
conviction a conviction does not
 
04:43:01.490 --> 04:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
disqualify an individual from possessing
 
04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
firearms if the person convicted has had
 
04:43:07.610 --> 04:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
civil rights restored
 
04:43:10.970 --> 04:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
in 922 G1 cases based upon State felony
 
04:43:13.010 --> 04:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
conviction courts have uniformly looked
 
04:43:15.350 --> 04:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the law of the state where the
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
conviction was obtained to determine
 
04:43:19.368 --> 04:43:19.378 align:start position:0%
whether the defendant's civil rights
 
04:43:21.530 --> 04:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
have been restored and whether sucks
 
04:43:24.410 --> 04:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
such action has nullified the
 
04:43:26.990 --> 04:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
convictions incidental prohibition on
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
firearms possession with respect to
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
felony convictions the Supreme Court
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
declared impeachment versus United
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
States that only federal law can nullify
 
04:43:38.448 --> 04:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
the effect of the conviction through
 
04:43:41.448 --> 04:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
expungement pardon or restoration of
 
04:43:44.930 --> 04:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
civil rights this is so the Court ruled
 
04:43:46.730 --> 04:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
even though there is no federal
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
procedure for restoring the civil rights
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
of federal felons okay so it's different
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
for federal felons
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the United States versus Ramos the
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
Court held that the term restored
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
requires the state to make an
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
individualized official judgment that
 
04:44:05.830 --> 04:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
the defendant should be
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
accepted from the provisions of 922 G1
 
04:44:12.170 --> 04:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
the Criminal Division takes the position
 
04:44:14.690 --> 04:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
that where the state law contains any
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
provision purporting to restore civil
 
04:44:20.570 --> 04:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
rights which 607a does either upon
 
04:44:22.730 --> 04:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
application by the defendant or
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
automatically upon completion of
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
sentence it does automatically in New
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it should be given effect it
 
04:44:32.330 --> 04:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
is not necessary that the State issue an
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
individualized certificate reflecting
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
the Judgment of State officials
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
regarding an individual defendant the
 
04:44:40.868 --> 04:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
Ramos case should be limited to
 
04:44:43.250 --> 04:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
its unique facts and not extended to
 
04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
attempts to nullify the effect of other
 
04:44:47.470 --> 04:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
state schemes for civil restoration
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
estate restoration document that is
 
04:44:53.690 --> 04:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
absolute on its face should disqualify
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
the affected state felon from
 
04:44:59.690 --> 04:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
prosecution under 922 G1 the federal
 
04:45:02.208 --> 04:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
statute so if if it's going to preclude
 
04:45:04.250 --> 04:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
them from prosecution so I'll be
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
precluded from prosecution for holding a
 
04:45:09.230 --> 04:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
firearm under 922g
 
04:45:12.230 --> 04:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
then how can the state
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
convict me for being a felon in
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
possession if the feds are relying on
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
this state statute to determine that I'm
 
04:45:23.208 --> 04:45:23.218 align:start position:0%
not a felon so I posit that the
 
04:45:27.170 --> 04:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
certificate of discharge 607 A5
 
04:45:29.448 --> 04:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
gives us back all our civil rights we
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
suffer no civil death upon completion of
 
04:45:33.650 --> 04:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
our sentence once we have no restitution
 
04:45:35.930 --> 04:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not serving probation or
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
parole which I'm not I'm completely off
 
04:45:41.330 --> 04:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
paper so it's my understanding in my
 
04:45:43.070 --> 04:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law that I can
 
04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
currently I'm not considered a felon the
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
04:45:52.250 --> 04:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
this 607a it defines what a felon is but
 
04:45:54.410 --> 04:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
it doesn't explicitly state it nowhere
 
04:45:57.530 --> 04:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
in the state law is felon defined felony
 
04:46:01.128 --> 04:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
is defined sure a felony is defined and
 
04:46:03.170 --> 04:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
violent felonies are defined in
 
04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
non-violent you can't turn non-violent
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
things into violent I mean that's pretty
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
crazy that this guy's even suggesting
 
04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I will say that that's absolutely
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and you should you should
 
04:46:20.810 --> 04:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
resign sir you want to keep testifying
 
04:46:24.410 --> 04:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
yes then keep it so whether it's violent
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
or non-violent once someone served their
 
04:46:26.400 --> 04:46:27.530 align:start position:0%
or non-violent once someone served their
conviction

04:46:27.530 --> 04:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
then they're no longer considered a
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
felon but so I would I would say that
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
607a backs up that chapter backs up this
 
04:46:38.510 --> 04:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
bill the um and it just needs to be
 
04:46:41.690 --> 04:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
clarified that in in the annulment
 
04:46:43.490 --> 04:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
statute needs to be repealed there's no
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
need for an annulment process and
 
04:46:47.208 --> 04:46:47.218 align:start position:0%
statute have to pay for the lawyers
 
04:46:47.218 --> 04:46:48.070 align:start position:0%
statute have to pay for the lawyers
because

04:46:48.070 --> 04:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
607a already gives us back our rights
 
04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
but it's very very
 
04:46:56.090 --> 04:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
um sophisticated language that you have
 
04:47:00.288 --> 04:47:00.298 align:start position:0%
to decipher to to uh to get gather all
 
04:47:00.298 --> 04:47:01.610 align:start position:0%
to decipher to to uh to get gather all
this

04:47:01.610 --> 04:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:47:03.650 --> 04:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
I can read
 
04:47:03.660 --> 04:47:04.550 align:start position:0%
I can read
um

04:47:04.550 --> 04:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:07.730 --> 04:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
right here the certificate of discharge
 
04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
if the sentence was imposed in this
 
04:47:12.050 --> 04:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
state uh the other instrument blah blah
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
blah completion of uh after completion
 
04:47:16.850 --> 04:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
of service of his sentence or after
 
04:47:19.730 --> 04:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
service of probation or parole shall
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
state that the defendant's right to vote
 
04:47:24.170 --> 04:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
and hold any future public office of
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
which he was deprived by this chapter
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
are thereby restored and that he suffers
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
no other disability by virtue of his
 
04:47:32.208 --> 04:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
conviction and sentence except as
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise provided by this chapter and
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
nowhere in this chapter does it say that
 
04:47:40.010 --> 04:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to have a firearm in
 
04:47:40.020 --> 04:47:41.030 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to have a firearm in
fact

04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
fact
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
the right to bear arms
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
which supersedes the Federal
 
04:47:47.330 --> 04:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
Constitution this is the New Hampshire
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
Constitution all persons have the right
 
04:47:51.410 --> 04:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
to keep and bear arms and defense of
 
04:47:52.910 --> 04:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
themselves their families the property
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
and the state so I would like to be able
 
04:47:58.490 --> 04:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
to carry a gun I carry knives all the
 
04:48:00.770 --> 04:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
time and I've defended myself with a
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
knife legally I've never assaulted
 
04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
anyone and I would like to like rep
 
04:48:08.448 --> 04:48:08.458 align:start position:0%
Gerhard be able to have a gun in case I
 
04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
need to stop a mass shooter which has
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
been done in in certain places there are
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of crazy people out there and it's
 
04:48:19.610 --> 04:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
right here it's protected in in the
 
04:48:23.690 --> 04:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
State Constitution and RSA 607a so I
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
figure maybe I'll go out and buy a gun
 
04:48:25.200 --> 04:48:27.350 align:start position:0%
figure maybe I'll go out and buy a gun
today

04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:48:29.330 --> 04:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
04:48:31.368 --> 04:48:31.378 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
no he has one
 
04:48:36.830 --> 04:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
I have a question to the chair we've
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
just heard an explosion of rsas I don't
 
04:48:40.850 --> 04:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
know what he's talking about can we get
 
04:48:42.288 --> 04:48:42.298 align:start position:0%
an opinion from the attorney general
 
04:48:44.208 --> 04:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
whether he's making sense
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
oh I'm making absolutely RSA 607 I'd
 
04:48:49.368 --> 04:48:49.378 align:start position:0%
love it would that be public sir
 
04:48:51.530 --> 04:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
would I be able to get a copy of that if
 
04:48:53.448 --> 04:48:53.458 align:start position:0%
he pulls I would love that from the
 
04:48:55.250 --> 04:48:55.260 align:start position:0%

04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
RSA 607a I've already tried to get it
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:15.530 --> 04:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know attorney Steven endres
 
04:49:15.540 --> 04:49:30.128 align:start position:0%
I don't know attorney Steven endres
please

04:49:30.128 --> 04:49:30.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Steven
 
04:49:33.770 --> 04:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
Anderson I'm an attorney with the
 
04:49:36.170 --> 04:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County Attorney's Office I've
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
been in a prosecutor for a little over
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
04:49:42.890 --> 04:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
with reference to
 
04:49:42.900 --> 04:49:43.430 align:start position:0%
with reference to
um

04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:45.410 --> 04:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
guns it's sort of always a hot button
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
issue and people have very emotional
 
04:49:49.670 --> 04:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
responses either way but
 
04:49:51.470 --> 04:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
the the fact of the matter is no matter
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
how you feel about guns the way it is in
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in
 
04:49:57.410 --> 04:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
is you have a right to bear guns and
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
Firearms unless there's a specific
 
04:50:02.170 --> 04:50:02.180 align:start position:0%
legislative act that prohibits it
 
04:50:04.610 --> 04:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
04:50:08.690 --> 04:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
RSA 159 3 is exactly one of those
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
statutes it sets forth a category of
 
04:50:11.160 --> 04:50:12.410 align:start position:0%
statutes it sets forth a category of
people

04:50:12.410 --> 04:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
in that category of people are people
 
04:50:16.490 --> 04:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
that have been convicted of felons
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
against the person or property of
 
04:50:18.000 --> 04:50:18.770 align:start position:0%
against the person or property of
another

04:50:18.770 --> 04:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:50:21.050 --> 04:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
or drug felonies and it sets forth a
 
04:50:21.060 --> 04:50:22.190 align:start position:0%
or drug felonies and it sets forth a
penalty

04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
which make it a class B felony for those
 
04:50:26.448 --> 04:50:26.458 align:start position:0%
individuals to possess firearms
 
04:50:28.610 --> 04:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
when I look at this bill one of the
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
things that strikes me
 
04:50:34.610 --> 04:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
is the first part of it repeals RSA 159
 
04:50:34.620 --> 04:50:36.110 align:start position:0%
is the first part of it repeals RSA 159
3.

04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
3.
 
04:50:38.810 --> 04:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
so it would repeal that category of
 
04:50:41.810 --> 04:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
persons as well as the prohibition
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
making a class B felony
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
and it replaces it by saying
 
04:50:46.680 --> 04:50:48.050 align:start position:0%
and it replaces it by saying
uh

04:50:48.050 --> 04:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
people convicted of felonies that did
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
not involve committing an act of
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
violence to have the right to possess
 
04:50:52.920 --> 04:50:54.830 align:start position:0%
violence to have the right to possess
firearms

04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
04:50:57.470 --> 04:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
with reference to felonies that did not
 
04:51:01.010 --> 04:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
involve an act of violence it makes me
 
04:51:03.288 --> 04:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
wonder what that means I hear the term
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
non-violent felons but
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
I would assume that for a felony to
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
involved an act of violence it would
 
04:51:13.070 --> 04:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
actually have to have an act of violence
 
04:51:15.650 --> 04:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
as an element of that felony
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the build defines act of violence as
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
physical harm inflicted upon another
 
04:51:19.680 --> 04:51:21.170 align:start position:0%
physical harm inflicted upon another
individual

04:51:21.170 --> 04:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:51:23.628 --> 04:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
there's actually not a lot of felonies
 
04:51:25.730 --> 04:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
that have an element of physical harm
 
04:51:28.190 --> 04:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
inflicted upon another individual
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
for example burglary is a property crime
 
04:51:32.690 --> 04:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
there's no element of violence in
 
04:51:32.700 --> 04:51:34.368 align:start position:0%
there's no element of violence in
burglary

04:51:34.368 --> 04:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
burglary
 
04:51:34.378 --> 04:51:35.090 align:start position:0%
burglary
um

04:51:35.090 --> 04:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:37.490 --> 04:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
arson is a property crime there's no
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
element of violence in arson kidnapping
 
04:51:43.070 --> 04:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
and stalking don't have any elements of
 
04:51:45.890 --> 04:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
violence within their their crime so I
 
04:51:46.970 --> 04:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
guess those would be considered
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
non-violent felonies as well
 
04:51:52.250 --> 04:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
um aggravated felonious sexual assault
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an element of physical harm
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
um in it either
 
04:51:58.200 --> 04:51:59.448 align:start position:0%
um in it either
so

04:51:59.448 --> 04:51:59.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:59.458 --> 04:52:00.770 align:start position:0%
so
all

04:52:00.770 --> 04:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:52:02.990 --> 04:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
all of those things don't have an
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
element which requires a person to be
 
04:52:05.160 --> 04:52:06.708 align:start position:0%
element which requires a person to be
injured

04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
injured
 
04:52:08.750 --> 04:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
statutes that require a person to be
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
injured for example the murder statutes
 
04:52:13.010 --> 04:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
first degree assault second-degree
 
04:52:13.020 --> 04:52:14.590 align:start position:0%
first degree assault second-degree
assault

04:52:14.590 --> 04:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
assault
 
04:52:16.970 --> 04:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
the only drug statute that I can think
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
of that has an element of physical harm
 
04:52:22.250 --> 04:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
is the death resulting statute
 
04:52:25.368 --> 04:52:25.378 align:start position:0%
but essentially all of those statutes
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
where there isn't an element of physical
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
harm wouldn't come under the language in
 
04:52:31.970 --> 04:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
this this amendment
 
04:52:34.250 --> 04:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I notice when I
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
look at this in section one is there's
 
04:52:38.990 --> 04:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
no penalty provision
 
04:52:39.000 --> 04:52:40.788 align:start position:0%
no penalty provision
so

04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:52:43.010 --> 04:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
as I read it it says
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
non if you're convicted of a felony that
 
04:52:47.690 --> 04:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
didn't involve committing an act of
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
violence you have the right to possess
 
04:52:51.170 --> 04:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
and use a firearm
 
04:52:53.390 --> 04:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
but what if you're convicted of a felony
 
04:52:56.090 --> 04:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
that did have an element of violence
 
04:52:58.070 --> 04:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be a class B felony anymore
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
because we would have repealed 159.3
 
04:53:04.368 --> 04:53:04.378 align:start position:0%
so it would essentially open it to
 
04:53:08.090 --> 04:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
all felons whether you are convicted of
 
04:53:12.170 --> 04:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.050 --> 04:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
I also think it's odd that the statute
 
04:53:16.610 --> 04:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
itself says that you have a right to
 
04:53:20.390 --> 04:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
possess and use firearms as I had
 
04:53:21.890 --> 04:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier essentially everyone
 
04:53:23.810 --> 04:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
has a right to possess Firearms unless
 
04:53:25.550 --> 04:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's a legislative act that restricts
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
you from doing so we don't need laws
 
04:53:30.530 --> 04:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
that specifically say this group of
 
04:53:32.570 --> 04:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
people has a right to possess firearms
 
04:53:35.090 --> 04:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
and I think writing a law that says this
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
specific group has the right to possess
 
04:53:39.650 --> 04:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
Firearms becomes confusing because
 
04:53:42.110 --> 04:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's other laws that restrict the use
 
04:53:44.090 --> 04:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
and possession of firearms
 
04:53:46.190 --> 04:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
for example you can't discharge a
 
04:53:48.410 --> 04:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
firearm within 300 feet of a permanently
 
04:53:51.050 --> 04:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
occupied dwelling
 
04:53:53.930 --> 04:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
that goes for everybody
 
04:53:55.850 --> 04:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
but if you're a convicted felon and you
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
have the right to possess and use a
 
04:53:58.080 --> 04:53:59.270 align:start position:0%
have the right to possess and use a
firearm

04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
04:54:02.150 --> 04:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
does that law apply to you now or does
 
04:54:03.890 --> 04:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
this law Trump the one that says you
 
04:54:05.570 --> 04:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
can't fire within 300 feet of an
 
04:54:07.250 --> 04:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
occupied dwelling
 
04:54:09.050 --> 04:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
it also
 
04:54:11.690 --> 04:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
for example in New Hampshire if you're
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
the subject of a protective order you're
 
04:54:16.250 --> 04:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
restricted from possessing firearms
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
if there's a lot that says specifically
 
04:54:20.448 --> 04:54:20.458 align:start position:0%
that a certain group has a right to
 
04:54:22.490 --> 04:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
possess firearms
 
04:54:25.490 --> 04:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
and if there's another law that says if
 
04:54:26.628 --> 04:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
in fact there's a protective order
 
04:54:28.430 --> 04:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
issued against you you don't have the
 
04:54:31.128 --> 04:54:31.138 align:start position:0%
right to possess Firearms which law wins
 
04:54:34.730 --> 04:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's also worth noting as indicated
 
04:54:40.310 --> 04:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
earlier federal law still prohibits
 
04:54:41.930 --> 04:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
um people convicted of felonies of
 
04:54:43.730 --> 04:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
possessing firearms
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
so even if we were to get rid of 159 3
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
it would be a federal felony to sell
 
04:54:53.390 --> 04:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
somebody a firearm if they were a
 
04:54:55.128 --> 04:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
convicted felon and it would be a
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
federal felony to possess a firearm if
 
04:54:58.610 --> 04:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
you were a convicted felon so it's not
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
like you could go to your local gun
 
04:55:03.830 --> 04:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
store and legally purchase a firearm
 
04:55:06.650 --> 04:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
even if this bill were to pass
 
04:55:11.208 --> 04:55:11.218 align:start position:0%
looking at the second section of
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 144 it talks about armed
 
04:55:16.190 --> 04:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
career criminals and again this suffers
 
04:55:19.310 --> 04:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
from sort of the same difficulty it says
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
in offense that involves an act of
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
violence or threat of violence and then
 
04:55:28.010 --> 04:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
defines that as bodily injury or the
 
04:55:30.890 --> 04:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
imminent fear of bodily injury but again
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
I presume that would have to be an
 
04:55:34.250 --> 04:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
element of the crime there's very
 
04:55:35.930 --> 04:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
limited crimes that actually have that
 
04:55:37.310 --> 04:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
as an element
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
there's a number of enumerated felonies
 
04:55:42.410 --> 04:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
in the second section one of which is
 
04:55:45.410 --> 04:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
arson but again arson doesn't have an
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
element of bodily injury or imminent
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
imminent bodily injury arson is a
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
property crime
 
04:55:53.390 --> 04:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
so it makes you wonder
 
04:55:55.550 --> 04:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
how many arsons could you have before
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
you became an armed career criminal and
 
04:56:00.470 --> 04:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
frankly I I think you could have as many
 
04:56:02.330 --> 04:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
as you wanted because there's never an
 
04:56:04.910 --> 04:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
element of violence in an arson case
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
same thing with burglary
 
04:56:10.250 --> 04:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
there's no physical harm or threat in a
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
burglary it's it's the crime of breaking
 
04:56:14.090 --> 04:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
into someone's property with an intent
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
to commit a crime within that property
 
04:56:18.770 --> 04:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
so theoretically you could have as many
 
04:56:20.690 --> 04:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
burglaries as you wanted and still
 
04:56:23.810 --> 04:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
possess firearms
 
04:56:25.788 --> 04:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
same thing with robbery
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's a version of robbery
 
04:56:30.410 --> 04:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
that does have bodily injury but
 
04:56:30.420 --> 04:56:32.030 align:start position:0%
that does have bodily injury but
generally

04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
generally
 
04:56:32.040 --> 04:56:34.490 align:start position:0%
generally
um

04:56:34.490 --> 04:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:36.350 --> 04:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
robbery is not a crime with that element
 
04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse images there's no
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
element of violence in in that crime
 
04:56:44.090 --> 04:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
and then looking at the third section of
 
04:56:48.170 --> 04:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
the bill House Bill 144 it amends
 
04:56:52.250 --> 04:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
the exceptions provision in 159.5
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
which currently says 159 3 and 159 Ford
 
04:56:58.990 --> 04:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
to just bring it to RSA 159.4
 
04:57:02.330 --> 04:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
so law enforcement would be exempt from
 
04:57:05.628 --> 04:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
RSA 159 4 which
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
makes no sense at all to me because RSA
 
04:57:12.770 --> 04:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
159 4 was actually repealed in 2017.
 
04:57:15.230 --> 04:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
so it would reference a statute that no
 
04:57:17.628 --> 04:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
longer exists and say that this group is
 
04:57:19.730 --> 04:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
exempt from this statute that doesn't
 
04:57:19.740 --> 04:57:21.350 align:start position:0%
exempt from this statute that doesn't
exist

04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
exist
 
04:57:21.360 --> 04:57:23.208 align:start position:0%
exist
so

04:57:23.208 --> 04:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
I think there's
 
04:57:27.288 --> 04:57:27.298 align:start position:0%
certainly the philosophy of allowing
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
felons to have guns which I would not be
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
in agreement with but if you did adopt
 
04:57:34.970 --> 04:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
that philosophy the language in this
 
04:57:37.730 --> 04:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
bill certainly in my opinion doesn't get
 
04:57:38.750 --> 04:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
you there
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'd ask that you find it
 
04:57:45.730 --> 04:57:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:48.288 --> 04:57:48.298 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
04:57:50.690 --> 04:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
you're the Merrimack County attorney
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
right I am an assistant County attorney
 
04:57:55.208 --> 04:57:55.218 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack County I may proceed yes
 
04:57:58.610 --> 04:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
are you representing other there is nine
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
other counties uh are you do you have
 
04:58:03.650 --> 04:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
are you claiming to represent them or is
 
04:58:05.690 --> 04:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
this your own offices or your own
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
opinion where is this coming from where
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
are you coming from so I only represent
 
04:58:12.350 --> 04:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack County Attorney's Office
 
04:58:14.570 --> 04:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
as I indicated earlier I'm an assistant
 
04:58:16.910 --> 04:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
County attorney in Merrimack County I
 
04:58:18.890 --> 04:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
have spoken with attorney Halverson who
 
04:58:20.810 --> 04:58:20.820 align:start position:0%
is the Merrimack County attorney he
 
04:58:23.270 --> 04:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today but he and I
 
04:58:25.010 --> 04:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
um did discuss this bill at length and
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
we agree on the the shortcomings within
 
04:58:27.840 --> 04:58:31.850 align:start position:0%
we agree on the the shortcomings within
it

04:58:31.850 --> 04:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.280 --> 04:58:36.770 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:58:36.770 --> 04:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:39.050 --> 04:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
04:58:42.070 --> 04:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
kidnapping is a non-violent crime
 
04:58:44.930 --> 04:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
in my opinion kidnapping does not have
 
04:58:48.050 --> 04:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
an element which requires bodily injury
 
04:58:50.930 --> 04:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
or an imminent threat so I'm just gonna
 
04:58:52.010 --> 04:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
go with you
 
04:58:54.050 --> 04:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
you can certainly read the kidnapping
 
04:58:56.208 --> 04:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
statute I think representative that he's
 
04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the the specific language
 
04:59:01.788 --> 04:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
in this bill versus those specifications
 
04:59:03.830 --> 04:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I can expand on that each crime
 
04:59:05.690 --> 04:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
has Elements which the state has to
 
04:59:08.930 --> 04:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
prove Beyond A Reasonable Doubt so for
 
04:59:08.940 --> 04:59:10.490 align:start position:0%
prove Beyond A Reasonable Doubt so for
example

04:59:10.490 --> 04:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:59:10.500 --> 04:59:11.750 align:start position:0%
example
um

04:59:11.750 --> 04:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:14.090 --> 04:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know burglary we would have to prove
 
04:59:15.948 --> 04:59:15.958 align:start position:0%
that the person entered the dwelling of
 
04:59:17.448 --> 04:59:17.458 align:start position:0%
another at night with the purpose to
 
04:59:19.850 --> 04:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
commit a crime they're in
 
04:59:19.860 --> 04:59:21.110 align:start position:0%
commit a crime they're in
um

04:59:21.110 --> 04:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:24.288 --> 04:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
none of those elements require bodily
 
04:59:27.410 --> 04:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
injury or the imminent use of physical
 
04:59:27.420 --> 04:59:29.030 align:start position:0%
injury or the imminent use of physical
Force

04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
Force
 
04:59:29.040 --> 04:59:30.288 align:start position:0%
Force
so

04:59:30.288 --> 04:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
when we look at whether or not something
 
04:59:35.150 --> 04:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
is a a violent felony I believe as this
 
04:59:36.708 --> 04:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
bill defines it
 
04:59:38.930 --> 04:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
it says a felony that did not involve a
 
04:59:41.208 --> 04:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
committing an act of violence and an act
 
04:59:43.430 --> 04:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
of violence is defined as physical harm
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
inflicted upon another individual
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
so the only way you would know if that
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
crime had an act of violence and if the
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
jury found or essentially the finder
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
effect finder found an act of violence
 
04:59:57.288 --> 04:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt would be if
 
04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
that act of violence were an element of
 
05:00:00.288 --> 05:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
the offense
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
and as I said earlier burglary doesn't
 
05:00:04.610 --> 05:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
have an act of violence as an element of
 
05:00:06.110 --> 05:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
the offense I don't believe kidnapping
 
05:00:09.530 --> 05:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
has an act of violence as an element of
 
05:00:10.730 --> 05:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
the offense
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
so you could certainly have a very
 
05:00:15.050 --> 05:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
violent kidnapping
 
05:00:16.850 --> 05:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have an element of the
 
05:00:16.860 --> 05:00:17.948 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have an element of the
offense

05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
offense
 
05:00:20.930 --> 05:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
involving an act of violence
 
05:00:23.810 --> 05:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
so in my opinion the only way you could
 
05:00:25.490 --> 05:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
have a felony that involves an act of
 
05:00:26.810 --> 05:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
violence is it would have to be an
 
05:00:28.430 --> 05:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
element otherwise you'd have to go back
 
05:00:31.128 --> 05:00:31.138 align:start position:0%
and look at the the alleged facts of
 
05:00:33.650 --> 05:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
each individual crime and decide
 
05:00:35.448 --> 05:00:35.458 align:start position:0%
essentially on a case-by-case basis
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not it was a a violent crime
 
05:00:39.170 --> 05:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:00:40.970 --> 05:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not sure how you would
 
05:00:45.170 --> 05:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
I won't even go to arson thank you
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
I was going to go there yeah
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
05:00:56.330 --> 05:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
I believe Austin is charged in two
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
different levels if you chat if you have
 
05:00:59.570 --> 05:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
a set somebody's house on fire at night
 
05:01:01.310 --> 05:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
when they could be sleeping there I
 
05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
believe they charge at a higher level
 
05:01:05.330 --> 05:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
and then if you set a fire to somebody's
 
05:01:07.128 --> 05:01:07.138 align:start position:0%
house in the daytime
 
05:01:10.128 --> 05:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
it's a lower level of crime because it's
 
05:01:11.628 --> 05:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
assumed that people won't be sleeping in
 
05:01:13.610 --> 05:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
the daytime and at night time they are
 
05:01:17.448 --> 05:01:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
of crime a crime of
 
05:01:24.890 --> 05:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
of injury or possible injury
 
05:01:27.050 --> 05:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
you mentioned Austin wasn't I did
 
05:01:29.330 --> 05:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
mention arson it's funny you think arson
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
would be in the index but it never is
 
05:01:32.638 --> 05:01:33.948 align:start position:0%
would be in the index but it never is
um

05:01:33.948 --> 05:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:37.850 --> 05:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.690 --> 05:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
arson is 634-1 it says a person's guilty
 
05:01:49.490 --> 05:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
of arson if he knowingly starts a fire
 
05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
or causes an explosion which unlawfully
 
05:01:54.110 --> 05:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
damages the property of another
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
so there's no act of violence or threat
 
05:01:58.010 --> 05:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
of violence in arson
 
05:02:00.110 --> 05:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
arson's class a felony if the property
 
05:02:02.090 --> 05:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
damaged is an occupied structure and the
 
05:02:04.010 --> 05:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
actor knew it was occupied or a historic
 
05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
structure so again there's no element of
 
05:02:09.890 --> 05:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
violence or threat of violence in that
 
05:02:09.900 --> 05:02:11.810 align:start position:0%
violence or threat of violence in that
are

05:02:11.810 --> 05:02:11.820 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:02:13.610 --> 05:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
but it
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
again violence is defined as physical
 
05:02:18.890 --> 05:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
injury to a person okay I won't believe
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
with the point
 
05:02:20.160 --> 05:02:20.810 align:start position:0%
with the point
um

05:02:20.810 --> 05:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:24.730 --> 05:02:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:32.690 --> 05:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.530 --> 05:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
better thank you
 
05:02:53.090 --> 05:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon my name is Joseph
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
Hannon I'm the vice president for gun
 
05:02:56.570 --> 05:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
owners of New Hampshire and I'm speaking
 
05:02:58.850 --> 05:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
in favor of the bill
 
05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
um there's a just for a little
 
05:03:02.708 --> 05:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
background uh under federal law
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
convicted felons lose the right to
 
05:03:07.368 --> 05:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
firearms and this decision stems from a
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
1934 law before that time for over 150
 
05:03:12.288 --> 05:03:12.298 align:start position:0%
years in this country if you did the
 
05:03:14.330 --> 05:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
time did the crime did the time your
 
05:03:16.128 --> 05:03:16.138 align:start position:0%
rights were all restored they handed
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
your gun back if they took it before you
 
05:03:18.890 --> 05:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
went to jail no matter what the crime
 
05:03:20.570 --> 05:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
was if it was so severe that you
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be out on the streets you
 
05:03:23.690 --> 05:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
weren't usually released
 
05:03:25.850 --> 05:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't even a problem or even a
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
consideration from the founding of our
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
country and the writing the Constitution
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
until 1934. in 1968 the gun control act
 
05:03:34.670 --> 05:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh changed it to anyone convicted of a
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
felony whether or not it involves
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
violence loses their right to Firearms
 
05:03:39.230 --> 05:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
there's also Provisions as you've heard
 
05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
to have rights restored at the federal
 
05:03:41.930 --> 05:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
level and also they can be done at the
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
state level through different mechanisms
 
05:03:45.708 --> 05:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
depending on the state but we also know
 
05:03:47.890 --> 05:03:47.900 align:start position:0%
that the federal level has really no
 
05:03:50.330 --> 05:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
implementation of following through on
 
05:03:51.410 --> 05:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
that mechanism at the federal level
 
05:03:54.110 --> 05:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's funded or if you try to
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
find the phone number to call to have
 
05:03:56.570 --> 05:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
your rights restored I still have not
 
05:03:58.850 --> 05:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
found that phone number
 
05:03:58.860 --> 05:03:59.810 align:start position:0%
found that phone number
um

05:03:59.810 --> 05:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:01.970 --> 05:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
the federal prohibition on non-violent
 
05:04:04.550 --> 05:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
criminals is not supported by the
 
05:04:05.628 --> 05:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
original understanding of the Second
 
05:04:07.510 --> 05:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment this is a new phenomenon since
 
05:04:10.368 --> 05:04:10.378 align:start position:0%
1968. uh there are courses and there are
 
05:04:12.650 --> 05:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
cases in court uh currently there's one
 
05:04:13.850 --> 05:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
out of Philadelphia there was one in
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
Colorado uh that people are trying to
 
05:04:17.208 --> 05:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
get the rights back for non-violent
 
05:04:20.090 --> 05:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
crimes uh I know I believe that I can't
 
05:04:21.170 --> 05:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
remember the name of the case offhand
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
but the Philadelphia case they're
 
05:04:24.050 --> 05:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
relying on the recent Supreme Court
 
05:04:26.090 --> 05:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
decision over the summer that people
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
have a right to to bear arms but
 
05:04:30.000 --> 05:04:30.948 align:start position:0%
have a right to to bear arms but
um

05:04:30.948 --> 05:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:35.208 --> 05:04:35.218 align:start position:0%
this is uh one of the biggest
 
05:04:37.730 --> 05:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I guess rebuttals to that is well you
 
05:04:39.530 --> 05:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
know reasonable regulation all this all
 
05:04:41.690 --> 05:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
these different examples of why you can
 
05:04:43.850 --> 05:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
have laws against everyone having a
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
firearm but uh what we don't hear about
 
05:04:50.448 --> 05:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
is the uh we do we should hear more of
 
05:04:52.250 --> 05:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
is the Supreme Court also said that it
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
should be based on the original intent
 
05:04:55.970 --> 05:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
and that was the purpose of the last
 
05:04:58.250 --> 05:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
several big gun rights cases we've uh
 
05:04:59.390 --> 05:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
that have been decided on by the Supreme
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
Court and the intent was obviously not
 
05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
to restrict the rights of non-violent
 
05:05:07.970 --> 05:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
people from bearing arms
 
05:05:10.610 --> 05:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
um even our own uh state constitution
 
05:05:10.620 --> 05:05:13.190 align:start position:0%
um even our own uh state constitution
says

05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
on penalties uh article 18 I'm sure
 
05:05:17.390 --> 05:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're aware of penalties to be
 
05:05:18.890 --> 05:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
proportioned to the offenses true design
 
05:05:20.330 --> 05:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
of punishment
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
all penalties to be proportioned to the
 
05:05:23.330 --> 05:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
nature of the offense no wise
 
05:05:25.010 --> 05:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
legislature will fix the same punishment
 
05:05:26.448 --> 05:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
to the crimes of theft foraging the like
 
05:05:27.770 --> 05:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
which they do to those of murder and
 
05:05:27.780 --> 05:05:28.910 align:start position:0%
which they do to those of murder and
treason

05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
treason
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
where the same undistinguishing severity
 
05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
is exert against all offenses the people
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
are led to forget the real distinction
 
05:05:35.690 --> 05:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
of the crimes themselves and to commit
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
the most flagrant as with little
 
05:05:38.930 --> 05:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
compunction as they do the slightest the
 
05:05:40.490 --> 05:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
latest offenses
 
05:05:43.970 --> 05:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
so you know is the a non-violent crime
 
05:05:46.368 --> 05:05:46.378 align:start position:0%
of writing a bad check 30 years ago or
 
05:05:49.368 --> 05:05:49.378 align:start position:0%
you know uh food stamp fraud
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know 10 20 years ago is that
 
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
something that's worth depriving someone
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
the right to defend their lives and the
 
05:05:56.510 --> 05:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
lives of their loved ones I don't
 
05:05:57.948 --> 05:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
believe it is I think that is definitely
 
05:05:59.868 --> 05:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
not proportioned to the crime and have a
 
05:05:59.878 --> 05:06:01.190 align:start position:0%
not proportioned to the crime and have a
blanket

05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
blanket
 
05:06:03.288 --> 05:06:03.298 align:start position:0%
um law that says you can't have your
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
rights that are inherent rights uh I
 
05:06:09.590 --> 05:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
think is absolutely wrong uh and real I
 
05:06:10.550 --> 05:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to go too long because I said
 
05:06:12.410 --> 05:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
I would only be a couple minutes but um
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know a few little things about the
 
05:06:16.550 --> 05:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill as far as specifics
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
um there is an except it says it
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't apply to U.S Marshals
 
05:06:21.590 --> 05:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
sheriff's police or other law
 
05:06:22.970 --> 05:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers bailiffs Court
 
05:06:25.250 --> 05:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
officers Etc so we're creating a special
 
05:06:26.810 --> 05:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
class of citizens again it's already in
 
05:06:28.910 --> 05:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
the law a lot of these laws don't apply
 
05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
to uh to those people but if you have an
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
officer who is allowed to keep their job
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
or a military person who was convicted
 
05:06:36.350 --> 05:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
of a felony inducted into the service
 
05:06:37.730 --> 05:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
they're serving their time they could be
 
05:06:39.050 --> 05:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
walking around with a rifle and active
 
05:06:40.430 --> 05:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
duty in New Hampshire and that's totally
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
legal uh so we've created little second
 
05:06:45.470 --> 05:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
classes we've created different classes
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
of citizens and how they're to be
 
05:06:48.110 --> 05:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
treated in New Hampshire with Firearms
 
05:06:50.030 --> 05:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
laws uh and there was a comment made
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
05:06:53.810 --> 05:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
you know violent drug laws you know and
 
05:06:56.030 --> 05:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
and I asked myself if someone is
 
05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
someone who's purchased or used or tries
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
to sell the drug
 
05:07:03.288 --> 05:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
um ethanol is that person a violent
 
05:07:03.298 --> 05:07:04.368 align:start position:0%
um ethanol is that person a violent
Criminal

05:07:04.368 --> 05:07:04.378 align:start position:0%
Criminal
 
05:07:06.770 --> 05:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
if they are I think we have a lot of uh
 
05:07:08.448 --> 05:07:08.458 align:start position:0%
questions to ask our own state for
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
selling it on street corners all
 
05:07:11.930 --> 05:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so just by the
 
05:07:13.850 --> 05:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
inherent fact that someone is using a
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
drug sold it or possessed it the only
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
distinction is listed versus illicit
 
05:07:19.368 --> 05:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
drugs and that is something that is
 
05:07:21.050 --> 05:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
being debated in other bills and laws
 
05:07:22.910 --> 05:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
around the country and from personal
 
05:07:24.170 --> 05:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
experience I can tell you I've never
 
05:07:26.448 --> 05:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
been assaulted by someone who was on
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis and this is not a cannabis bill
 
05:07:29.930 --> 05:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
but I've never been assaulted by someone
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
who was on cannabis in a bar it's
 
05:07:34.250 --> 05:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
usually someone drunk gets beer muscles
 
05:07:36.050 --> 05:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
and they get all into full themselves so
 
05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should draw those
 
05:07:41.530 --> 05:07:41.540 align:start position:0%
distinctions on our uh our own perceived
 
05:07:43.610 --> 05:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
biases towards different substances
 
05:07:45.830 --> 05:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm not going to ask it for a
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
show of hands but you know if if you
 
05:07:49.730 --> 05:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you drank alcohol you
 
05:07:52.010 --> 05:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
may be a violent criminal so I'm happy
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:57.288 --> 05:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
what is the position of the organization
 
05:07:59.868 --> 05:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
on um we were talking about felonies but
 
05:08:02.330 --> 05:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
isn't it also true that any misdemeanor
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
where you could spend up to a year in
 
05:08:06.170 --> 05:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
prison it triggers a federal buyer to
 
05:08:08.690 --> 05:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
possession of firearms uh we'd be very
 
05:08:10.368 --> 05:08:10.378 align:start position:0%
happy for an amendment to extend it to
 
05:08:13.970 --> 05:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:16.610 --> 05:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
if someone is not convicted of violence
 
05:08:19.128 --> 05:08:19.138 align:start position:0%
or someone is not a violent person why
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
should that right be
 
05:08:23.690 --> 05:08:23.700 align:start position:0%
taken away and in this state it is not
 
05:08:25.490 --> 05:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
decided necessarily in a case-by-case
 
05:08:26.990 --> 05:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
basis if you've been convicted you are
 
05:08:29.570 --> 05:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
automatically denied that right beyond
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
the terms of your punishment and debt to
 
05:08:33.000 --> 05:08:33.948 align:start position:0%
the terms of your punishment and debt to
society

05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
society
 
05:08:35.690 --> 05:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know we always heard I heard growing
 
05:08:37.250 --> 05:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
up you pay you do the crime do the time
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
but also you paid your debt to society
 
05:08:42.770 --> 05:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
when does that happen apparently death
 
05:08:45.890 --> 05:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:48.170 --> 05:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up
 
05:08:51.530 --> 05:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
an oui conviction a what an oh uh
 
05:08:53.090 --> 05:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
driving Under the Influence conviction
 
05:08:55.128 --> 05:08:55.138 align:start position:0%
you can lose your right to carry
 
05:08:56.810 --> 05:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
firearms because of the potential
 
05:09:02.810 --> 05:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:06.170 --> 05:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newman
 
05:09:08.330 --> 05:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
I just have a quiet follow-up to your
 
05:09:10.690 --> 05:09:10.700 align:start position:0%
question what about a DUI or oui
 
05:09:13.310 --> 05:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
conviction that caused injuries is that
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
a violent felony and that gets to is
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
there a good definition either in local
 
05:09:21.288 --> 05:09:21.298 align:start position:0%
I mean New Hampshire or federal law of
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
that uh I think it is addressed in the
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
language of the the bill in this
 
05:09:26.510 --> 05:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph and active violence means
 
05:09:28.788 --> 05:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
attempting to cause or purposefully or
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
recklessly causing bodily injury or
 
05:09:32.810 --> 05:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury with or without a
 
05:09:34.010 --> 05:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon
 
05:09:35.690 --> 05:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
so I believe that would be covered if
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
someone is uh seriously injured I
 
05:09:39.350 --> 05:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
whether I agree with or not I don't want
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
to say because I don't know the
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
specifics of any individual case but if
 
05:09:44.330 --> 05:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
someone is injured by this I would read
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
it as they they would be prohibited and
 
05:09:48.350 --> 05:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
not exempt under this bill
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that covers if this
 
05:09:52.010 --> 05:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
bill becomes law that would be the
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
definition then
 
05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:10:04.868 --> 05:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh for listening here I do
 
05:10:09.288 --> 05:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
support this bill although I don't think
 
05:10:11.448 --> 05:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
it goes far enough
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh the fact is there's the reality and
 
05:10:16.128 --> 05:10:16.138 align:start position:0%
then there's what the law says
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the reality is if a violent person
 
05:10:21.708 --> 05:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
gets out of prison after being convicted
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
for a violent crime and that violent
 
05:10:26.330 --> 05:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
person wants to go and get themselves a
 
05:10:26.340 --> 05:10:27.470 align:start position:0%
person wants to go and get themselves a
gun

05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
gun
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what the law says
 
05:10:32.390 --> 05:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to get a gun
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
where there's a will there's a way and
 
05:10:35.208 --> 05:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
if they want to go and commit another
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
violent act they're going to do that
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
they don't care what the law says by
 
05:10:42.170 --> 05:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
definition that kind of person doesn't
 
05:10:42.180 --> 05:10:43.368 align:start position:0%
definition that kind of person doesn't
care

05:10:43.368 --> 05:10:43.378 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:10:45.170 --> 05:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
about what the law says they've proven
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
that by the fact they violated it in the
 
05:10:49.128 --> 05:10:49.138 align:start position:0%
first place so really what these
 
05:10:52.550 --> 05:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on felons owning guns or
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
possessing guns prohibits is the people
 
05:10:58.010 --> 05:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
who've tried to turn their lives around
 
05:11:00.110 --> 05:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
the people who maybe they did something
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
wrong when they were in their teens or
 
05:11:04.490 --> 05:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
their 20s and then they spent some time
 
05:11:07.070 --> 05:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
in prison and then they got a family
 
05:11:08.750 --> 05:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
together and they started their own
 
05:11:10.788 --> 05:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
business or you know whatever the story
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
is they've turned their lives around
 
05:11:14.208 --> 05:11:14.218 align:start position:0%
they haven't uh recidivized they haven't
 
05:11:18.170 --> 05:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
committed another act they are now a
 
05:11:20.390 --> 05:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
valuable member of society but they're
 
05:11:22.610 --> 05:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
prohibited because of a mistake they
 
05:11:25.250 --> 05:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
made in their past from being able to
 
05:11:27.590 --> 05:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
protect their families and themselves
 
05:11:29.330 --> 05:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Constitution is
 
05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
very clear when it says that all persons
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
have the right to keep and bear arms in
 
05:11:36.410 --> 05:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
defense of themselves or families their
 
05:11:37.970 --> 05:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
property in the state it doesn't say
 
05:11:40.610 --> 05:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
with the exception of if the legislature
 
05:11:42.050 --> 05:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't like them
 
05:11:44.448 --> 05:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
so like I said I support the bill but I
 
05:11:46.970 --> 05:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
think that quote-unquote violent felons
 
05:11:49.970 --> 05:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
do not all go on to commit more violence
 
05:11:52.250 --> 05:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
and they should also be included in this
 
05:11:52.260 --> 05:11:54.770 align:start position:0%
and they should also be included in this
legislation

05:11:54.770 --> 05:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:11:58.430 --> 05:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
because they're humans too thank you
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any questions thank you
 
05:12:00.840 --> 05:12:03.410 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any questions thank you
Mr

05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify who has
 
05:12:07.490 --> 05:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
not testified on a spill
 
05:12:10.610 --> 05:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none I closed the public hearing
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:16.010 --> 05:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
what does it do right now I think this
 
05:12:19.910 --> 05:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
crowd is here for the blackjacks okay
 
05:12:21.170 --> 05:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
and this time I'll open the public
 
05:12:23.890 --> 05:12:23.900 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP 31 and recognize
 
05:12:32.570 --> 05:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:12:36.170 --> 05:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for uh allowing me
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
to introduce this bill I am
 
05:12:39.050 --> 05:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative James Spillane
 
05:12:40.730 --> 05:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
representing Deerfield
 
05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
Candia and Auburn
 
05:12:43.080 --> 05:12:44.390 align:start position:0%
Candia and Auburn
uh

05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:46.490 --> 05:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
based on what I've heard I hope this
 
05:12:47.868 --> 05:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
one's a lot simpler than what you've
 
05:12:51.288 --> 05:12:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%
HB 31 is looking to repeal two rsas RSA
 
05:12:59.150 --> 05:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
15916 and one RSA 15917 which Trails
 
05:13:04.250 --> 05:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
once uh colon 16 and is tied to it
 
05:13:04.260 --> 05:13:05.990 align:start position:0%
once uh colon 16 and is tied to it
um

05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:10.610 --> 05:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
RSA 15916 prohibits people from owning
 
05:13:12.970 --> 05:13:12.980 align:start position:0%
or selling uh
 
05:13:15.948 --> 05:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
blackjacks slung shots and metallic
 
05:13:18.190 --> 05:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
Knuckles brass knuckles
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
there's no reason
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
to have a Prohibition on these items
 
05:13:26.930 --> 05:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
anymore we allowed knives of any length
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
to be legal in New Hampshire over 12
 
05:13:31.610 --> 05:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
years ago we have uh
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
uh people able to carry firearms for
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
self-defense and the truth is that
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
blackjacks slung shots and brass
 
05:13:41.030 --> 05:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
knuckles are purely non-lethal defense
 
05:13:41.040 --> 05:13:42.368 align:start position:0%
knuckles are purely non-lethal defense
weapons

05:13:42.368 --> 05:13:42.378 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
05:13:46.490 --> 05:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
tools to be used to protect yourself and
 
05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
quite frequently um let me Define what a
 
05:13:50.930 --> 05:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
slung shot is because most people don't
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
know what it is it's essentially just a
 
05:13:57.230 --> 05:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
weighted stone or or a ball on the end
 
05:14:00.050 --> 05:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
of a braided rope
 
05:14:03.050 --> 05:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
and quite often uh those are sold as
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
monkey fists and they're carried on
 
05:14:05.160 --> 05:14:06.530 align:start position:0%
monkey fists and they're carried on
keychains

05:14:06.530 --> 05:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
keychains
 
05:14:10.670 --> 05:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh quite often women will carry these to
 
05:14:12.288 --> 05:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
be able to offer some form of
 
05:14:13.970 --> 05:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
self-defense if they're assaulted when
 
05:14:15.410 --> 05:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
they're walking alone
 
05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh Blackjack is the same sort of thing
 
05:14:20.868 --> 05:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
except that it's a leather strap with a
 
05:14:23.330 --> 05:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
weight in one end
 
05:14:23.340 --> 05:14:25.128 align:start position:0%
weight in one end
and

05:14:25.128 --> 05:14:25.138 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:25.138 --> 05:14:26.410 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:14:26.410 --> 05:14:26.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:26.420 --> 05:14:27.948 align:start position:0%
um
these

05:14:27.948 --> 05:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:14:30.368 --> 05:14:30.378 align:start position:0%
strictly non-lethal
 
05:14:30.378 --> 05:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
strictly non-lethal
antiquated

05:14:31.910 --> 05:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
antiquated
 
05:14:34.970 --> 05:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
methods of self-defense should not be
 
05:14:37.250 --> 05:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
prohibited from an option for somebody
 
05:14:39.770 --> 05:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
in addition to being able to carry a
 
05:14:42.250 --> 05:14:42.260 align:start position:0%
knife or pepper spray or what have you
 
05:14:42.260 --> 05:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
knife or pepper spray or what have you
[Music]

05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:14:42.480 --> 05:14:43.670 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:46.490 --> 05:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
if I go to the the actual statute
 
05:14:47.930 --> 05:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't included in the bill
 
05:14:49.788 --> 05:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
and I think that it's it's important to
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
also hear how it's it's written
 
05:14:56.150 --> 05:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
15916 says that whoever except as
 
05:14:58.368 --> 05:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
provided by the laws of this state sells
 
05:15:00.410 --> 05:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
has in his possession with intent to
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
sell or carries on his person any
 
05:15:04.368 --> 05:15:04.378 align:start position:0%
Blackjack slung shot or metallic
 
05:15:06.050 --> 05:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
Knuckles shall be guilty of a
 
05:15:08.570 --> 05:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and as such and such weapon
 
05:15:11.150 --> 05:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
or articles so carried by him shall be
 
05:15:14.030 --> 05:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
confiscated to the use of the state
 
05:15:16.010 --> 05:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
what the state's going to use it for I
 
05:15:19.010 --> 05:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
have no idea but the state can go around
 
05:15:20.810 --> 05:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
collecting them confiscating them and
 
05:15:22.670 --> 05:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
then using them
 
05:15:25.208 --> 05:15:25.218 align:start position:0%
the reason I've also asked to repeal
 
05:15:28.610 --> 05:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
colon 17 is because 17 basically says
 
05:15:30.350 --> 05:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
the provisions of the preceding section
 
05:15:32.690 --> 05:15:32.700 align:start position:0%
all of 16
 
05:15:34.490 --> 05:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
shall not apply to officers of the law
 
05:15:36.288 --> 05:15:36.298 align:start position:0%
to persons holding hunting or fishing
 
05:15:38.390 --> 05:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
licenses when lawfully engaged in
 
05:15:39.770 --> 05:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
hunting or fishing
 
05:15:41.750 --> 05:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
which is how I became aware of this as
 
05:15:44.270 --> 05:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
the chairman of Fish and Game to
 
05:15:46.430 --> 05:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
employees of Express companies while on
 
05:15:48.288 --> 05:15:48.298 align:start position:0%
duty to Watchmen while on duty to
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
emergency medical technicians
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
firefighters military personnel while in
 
05:15:53.448 --> 05:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
the course of their duties or a duly
 
05:15:54.890 --> 05:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
authorized military or Civic
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
organizations when parading or to the
 
05:15:57.890 --> 05:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
members thereof
 
05:15:59.810 --> 05:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
goes on there's a whole lot of people
 
05:16:02.090 --> 05:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
that are allowed to carry this and and
 
05:16:04.250 --> 05:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
exempt it from the previous section
 
05:16:06.410 --> 05:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
but it's such a poorly written bill
 
05:16:08.810 --> 05:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
that when they put this exception in it
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
accepted the entire first paragraph
 
05:16:13.368 --> 05:16:13.378 align:start position:0%
which also included selling so you've
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
essentially said that all of these
 
05:16:16.730 --> 05:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
people listed here can sell
 
05:16:16.740 --> 05:16:18.230 align:start position:0%
people listed here can sell
blackjacks

05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
blackjacks
 
05:16:21.410 --> 05:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
slung shots and brass knuckles so police
 
05:16:23.330 --> 05:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
officers could open little boutiques in
 
05:16:25.430 --> 05:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
the back trunk of the car and sell brass
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
knuckles slung shots and and uh
 
05:16:30.890 --> 05:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
blackjacks out of the back of the trunk
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
of their car a hunter in his tree stand
 
05:16:34.850 --> 05:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
could open up a briefcase and open up a
 
05:16:36.650 --> 05:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
little shop and sell them perfectly
 
05:16:38.570 --> 05:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
legal because this is so poorly written
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
that the second paragraph exempts the
 
05:16:41.810 --> 05:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
entire first paragraph for this group of
 
05:16:41.820 --> 05:16:43.368 align:start position:0%
entire first paragraph for this group of
people

05:16:43.368 --> 05:16:43.378 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:16:45.948 --> 05:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
and it's it's just a shambles
 
05:16:48.910 --> 05:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you to repeal both of them
 
05:16:52.368 --> 05:16:52.378 align:start position:0%
they are widely in use in the state
 
05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
they're not being this prohibition is
 
05:16:56.990 --> 05:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
not enforced except maybe as a secondary
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
offense if they stop somebody for some
 
05:17:00.530 --> 05:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
other offense and they say oh we can
 
05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
also add on another charge because
 
05:17:03.890 --> 05:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
they're carrying that
 
05:17:06.050 --> 05:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
one more thing I'll add before I finish
 
05:17:08.208 --> 05:17:08.218 align:start position:0%
and take questions
 
05:17:10.190 --> 05:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
you can go through the airport and TSA
 
05:17:11.810 --> 05:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
will not take a monkey fist off your
 
05:17:13.610 --> 05:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
keychain or a blackjack off your
 
05:17:16.010 --> 05:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
keychain if you're carrying one
 
05:17:18.410 --> 05:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's not considered a lethal weapon and
 
05:17:19.730 --> 05:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
they don't care if you carry it on a
 
05:17:19.740 --> 05:17:20.868 align:start position:0%
they don't care if you carry it on a
plane

05:17:20.868 --> 05:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
plane
 
05:17:23.090 --> 05:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
if TSA is not going to prevent us from
 
05:17:24.770 --> 05:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
carrying those on a plane why are we
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
saying that you can't carry them around
 
05:17:28.070 --> 05:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
to Via self-defense when you're walking
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
to a dark parking garage in the middle
 
05:17:31.788 --> 05:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
of the night
 
05:17:37.010 --> 05:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:40.010 --> 05:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative scitec when you read that
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
list of PR at the original Bill original
 
05:17:46.010 --> 05:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
Law you said possession with intent to
 
05:17:48.708 --> 05:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
sell is it possible to just outright own
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
it no it says whoever except is provided
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
by the laws of the state sells has in
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
his possession with intent to sell or
 
05:17:59.810 --> 05:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
carries on his person what
 
05:18:01.730 --> 05:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
what prohibits just outright ownership
 
05:18:06.550 --> 05:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.050 --> 05:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
technically I suppose you could own it
 
05:18:12.410 --> 05:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
in your house and frequently we've seen
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
I mean growing up I've been in New
 
05:18:16.730 --> 05:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all my life and you could go
 
05:18:19.128 --> 05:18:19.138 align:start position:0%
down to the local uh five and ten shop
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
and you'd see brass knuckles for sale
 
05:18:24.670 --> 05:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.708 --> 05:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
it's and right now you can go onto
 
05:18:29.628 --> 05:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
Amazon and buy a blackjack
 
05:18:32.270 --> 05:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
and it's called a a book weight
 
05:18:34.128 --> 05:18:34.138 align:start position:0%
because it's a leather strap that has a
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
weight on the end that holds your book
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
open but it's a blackjack
 
05:18:40.788 --> 05:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
and a monkey fist is just a steel Bell
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
bearing inside a braided paracord that's
 
05:18:45.170 --> 05:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
hung on your keychain and it's
 
05:18:47.510 --> 05:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
considered technically a slung shot
 
05:18:50.090 --> 05:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
but it offers somebody just like
 
05:18:51.948 --> 05:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
wrapping your keychain up and having a
 
05:18:54.050 --> 05:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
key ready in case you get assaulted it
 
05:18:55.788 --> 05:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
offers you something easy at hand while
 
05:18:57.530 --> 05:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
you're walking to your car that you can
 
05:18:58.970 --> 05:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
use to defend yourself so you can run
 
05:19:05.628 --> 05:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh the chair recognizes representative
 
05:19:14.520 --> 05:19:22.788 align:start position:0%
uh the chair recognizes representative
Hall

05:19:22.788 --> 05:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:24.770 --> 05:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman representative hold
 
05:19:26.930 --> 05:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton here on behalf of the New
 
05:19:28.970 --> 05:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Firearms coalition
 
05:19:31.550 --> 05:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition is
 
05:19:34.550 --> 05:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
a 501c4 non-profit representing the gun
 
05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
owners in the state and all those this
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill has almost nothing to do with the
 
05:19:42.050 --> 05:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
gun owners directly it has to do with
 
05:19:43.788 --> 05:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
something called possessionary offenses
 
05:19:45.770 --> 05:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
and in this case its possessionary
 
05:19:48.350 --> 05:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
offenses of self-defense tools from the
 
05:19:50.208 --> 05:19:50.218 align:start position:0%
early 1900s
 
05:19:53.030 --> 05:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
right today people would carry mace with
 
05:19:54.770 --> 05:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
them or pepper spray that would be the
 
05:19:57.830 --> 05:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
vote most common non-lethal tool that
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
someone would carry with them if they
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
wanted to protect themselves
 
05:20:03.650 --> 05:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
that has supplanted most of the ones on
 
05:20:05.510 --> 05:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
this list
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
um these are now collector's items let's
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
call them what they are these these are
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
things that go in museums for the most
 
05:20:11.040 --> 05:20:12.170 align:start position:0%
things that go in museums for the most
part

05:20:12.170 --> 05:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
part
 
05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
um so because it's a possessionary
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
offense and possessionary offenses it's
 
05:20:19.850 --> 05:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
it's not what the tool is it's how the
 
05:20:21.770 --> 05:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
tool is used murder is a crime because
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
you've used something what baseball bat
 
05:20:27.708 --> 05:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
acts firearm doesn't matter whatever and
 
05:20:29.930 --> 05:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
you've harmed someone that's a crime we
 
05:20:32.270 --> 05:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
we definitely have laws that prohibit
 
05:20:34.550 --> 05:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
crimes and we we do things about crimes
 
05:20:36.650 --> 05:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
but the mere possession of something
 
05:20:38.750 --> 05:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
should never be an offense unless it's
 
05:20:40.310 --> 05:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
part of a criminal right part of the
 
05:20:42.470 --> 05:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
evidence of a criminal activity right I
 
05:20:43.670 --> 05:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
have a stolen good that's a different
 
05:20:43.680 --> 05:20:44.570 align:start position:0%
have a stolen good that's a different
story

05:20:44.570 --> 05:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
story
 
05:20:46.670 --> 05:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
so we would ask that you would pass this
 
05:20:48.650 --> 05:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
because we leave these laws on our books
 
05:20:51.830 --> 05:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
that really aren't enforced that um as
 
05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
the as the prior member said right he
 
05:20:55.788 --> 05:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
wants to buy a paperweight to hold his
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
book open
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
and it just happens to be sold to
 
05:21:01.730 --> 05:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
something else they do sell knives that
 
05:21:04.670 --> 05:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
happen to have a series of finger holds
 
05:21:07.610 --> 05:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
built into the hilt that
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
potentially under and overzealous
 
05:21:13.250 --> 05:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
prosecutor could be prosecuted for one
 
05:21:15.410 --> 05:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
of these laws type thing and all it is
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
is a better way to hold on to the to the
 
05:21:17.280 --> 05:21:18.050 align:start position:0%
is a better way to hold on to the to the
knife

05:21:18.050 --> 05:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
knife
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
so with that I would ask the New
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Firearms Coalition as an
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
organization supports this supports the
 
05:21:25.788 --> 05:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
repeal because these this law is is
 
05:21:27.708 --> 05:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
Antiquated and it really has to do with
 
05:21:29.570 --> 05:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
effectively collectors item self-defense
 
05:21:30.890 --> 05:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
tools thank you
 
05:21:32.530 --> 05:21:32.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:43.250 --> 05:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:45.770 --> 05:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
I live in a horrible neighborhood in
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and as I showed
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
you earlier I have a knife a knife is
 
05:21:53.208 --> 05:21:53.218 align:start position:0%
actually more deadly than a gun if I was
 
05:21:54.650 --> 05:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
to stab somebody with this it's over
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
with I would prefer not to have to do
 
05:22:00.230 --> 05:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
that and be able to use something like a
 
05:22:03.650 --> 05:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
club a blackjack a sap or some metallic
 
05:22:06.250 --> 05:22:06.260 align:start position:0%
Knuckles Not only would it keep me from
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
likely killing this person and causing
 
05:22:11.530 --> 05:22:11.540 align:start position:0%
you know the ambulance and all that
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
but it would protect my hands as well so
 
05:22:17.868 --> 05:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
anyone who has to use their hands for a
 
05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
living whether it's typing or doing any
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
work that would allow people to protect
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
their hands if they ever did have to
 
05:22:26.448 --> 05:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
defend themselves in a situation like
 
05:22:29.570 --> 05:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
this and I mean it's absurd I'm allowed
 
05:22:32.810 --> 05:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
to have a sword on my hip and and all
 
05:22:36.170 --> 05:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
these knives but at any length but I
 
05:22:38.750 --> 05:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
can't have a a little blackjack or or a
 
05:22:40.670 --> 05:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
monkey fist or something like that it's
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's pretty crazy and like uh J.R Hull
 
05:22:46.010 --> 05:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
said there's already crimes if you
 
05:22:48.650 --> 05:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
assault somebody with a pen it's a salt
 
05:22:50.090 --> 05:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
with a deadly weapon if you assault
 
05:22:52.128 --> 05:22:52.138 align:start position:0%
somebody with a rock it's all if you saw
 
05:22:53.770 --> 05:22:53.780 align:start position:0%
somebody with a sap a blackjack
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
unprovoked it's not self-defense then it
 
05:22:58.610 --> 05:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
is assault unprovoked assault so we
 
05:23:00.830 --> 05:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
already have crimes and I think of being
 
05:23:03.730 --> 05:23:03.740 align:start position:0%
redundant at this point thank you
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
thank you no questions
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh Mr Staples
 
05:23:16.970 --> 05:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Staples I think
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if you just said it or
 
05:23:21.650 --> 05:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
the previous uh representative
 
05:23:24.110 --> 05:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
but I I just kind of quick looked while
 
05:23:26.570 --> 05:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
there was testimony going on brass
 
05:23:29.208 --> 05:23:29.218 align:start position:0%
knuckles could be carried on and could
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
get through TSA but they would have to
 
05:23:33.770 --> 05:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
be in a checked in a checked bag check
 
05:23:35.330 --> 05:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
thing and I think there have been
 
05:23:38.628 --> 05:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
instances when TSA has confiscated
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call them a brass
 
05:23:44.030 --> 05:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
monkey thing or whatever sure check bags
 
05:23:46.490 --> 05:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
do I have a question
 
05:23:49.730 --> 05:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
yes do you agree with what I just said
 
05:23:49.740 --> 05:23:50.930 align:start position:0%
yes do you agree with what I just said
um

05:23:50.930 --> 05:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I know that they they sell on
 
05:23:55.550 --> 05:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
eBay they sell like bulk things that
 
05:23:57.890 --> 05:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
have been confiscated by TSA that people
 
05:23:59.750 --> 05:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
never came back to claim so I'm sure
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
there's probably I've never purchased a
 
05:24:04.128 --> 05:24:04.138 align:start position:0%
thing like that but uh I'm sure they
 
05:24:06.590 --> 05:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
confiscate things and make mistakes like
 
05:24:08.750 --> 05:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
these I think we the problem that we
 
05:24:10.750 --> 05:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
have here is there are just too many
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
redundant laws that aren't really doing
 
05:24:15.410 --> 05:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
anything except causing a lot of
 
05:24:17.810 --> 05:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
confusion you know we have these assault
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
laws somebody assault somebody's assault
 
05:24:22.670 --> 05:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's with a weapon or without a
 
05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
weapon and the weapon could be anything
 
05:24:27.708 --> 05:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
could be this Clorox thing like
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:42.110 --> 05:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:45.470 --> 05:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
hello again oh it's on good
 
05:24:47.690 --> 05:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
um johannan from Gunners New Hampshire
 
05:24:49.550 --> 05:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
um like representative hole said
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm from a gun organ gun uh
 
05:24:53.448 --> 05:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
organization in New Hampshire but uh
 
05:24:55.190 --> 05:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
this is relevant because it has to do
 
05:24:58.550 --> 05:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
with any kind of uh arm or um possession
 
05:24:58.560 --> 05:25:00.050 align:start position:0%
with any kind of uh arm or um possession
case

05:25:00.050 --> 05:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
um I actually had to look up some of the
 
05:25:02.810 --> 05:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
terms I know obviously I know what brass
 
05:25:04.190 --> 05:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
knuckles are
 
05:25:05.690 --> 05:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
um I know what a blackjack is but a
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
slung shot I just wasn't sure exactly so
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
I looked it up and I was like oh yeah I
 
05:25:09.830 --> 05:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
know what that is
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
um but historically it was uh it was
 
05:25:16.368 --> 05:25:16.378 align:start position:0%
actually used for maritime reasons
 
05:25:16.378 --> 05:25:17.030 align:start position:0%
actually used for maritime reasons
um

05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:19.310 --> 05:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
it was a way to fix a way to fix to a
 
05:25:20.810 --> 05:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
long chord to be used to cast a line
 
05:25:22.310 --> 05:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
from one location to another which
 
05:25:24.650 --> 05:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
explains why in the current statute it's
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
except it's one of the exceptions to
 
05:25:28.190 --> 05:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
carry any of these items during hunting
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
or fishing if you have a valid license
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
and you're doing that activity so um
 
05:25:33.230 --> 05:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's okay to have it I guess if you're
 
05:25:34.730 --> 05:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
doing that but it's I don't really see a
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
way how you can buy it or sell it unless
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
you happen to see someone else hunting
 
05:25:39.890 --> 05:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
or fishing and happens to have a
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
blackjacks you know or whatever the
 
05:25:44.090 --> 05:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
brass knuckles with them or slug shot
 
05:25:45.470 --> 05:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
and you can buy it while you're both
 
05:25:46.730 --> 05:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing or they're a law
 
05:25:48.110 --> 05:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer or any other one of
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
these other uh exceptions
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
I I do believe that a lot of these
 
05:25:54.650 --> 05:25:54.660 align:start position:0%
things are are not even going to be
 
05:25:57.410 --> 05:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
really used at all for even self-defense
 
05:25:59.150 --> 05:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
purposes as there are far better ways of
 
05:26:00.050 --> 05:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
05:26:01.310 --> 05:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
um you don't even need a permit to carry
 
05:26:02.690 --> 05:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
a firearm in New Hampshire if you're
 
05:26:05.208 --> 05:26:05.218 align:start position:0%
legally allowed to obtain a firearm
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
um that's a pretty you know uh
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
Superior method of self-defense but not
 
05:26:13.970 --> 05:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
everyone can afford hundreds of dollars
 
05:26:16.490 --> 05:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
for a firearm so if someone is poor this
 
05:26:17.628 --> 05:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
is actually something that disadvantages
 
05:26:19.788 --> 05:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
people they can't afford four or five
 
05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars just to defend
 
05:26:20.878 --> 05:26:22.368 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars just to defend
themselves

05:26:22.368 --> 05:26:22.378 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:26:25.010 --> 05:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
um the law also talks about and I'm sure
 
05:26:29.090 --> 05:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
this is you know just semantic but uh
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know has in his or her his
 
05:26:33.470 --> 05:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
possession with intent to sell
 
05:26:36.410 --> 05:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
um it I guess women are allowed to have
 
05:26:37.550 --> 05:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
these things doesn't say anything about
 
05:26:39.288 --> 05:26:39.298 align:start position:0%
her it just says his so I don't know
 
05:26:41.030 --> 05:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
maybe just I'm reading too much into it
 
05:26:43.128 --> 05:26:43.138 align:start position:0%
but interestingly enough it says if
 
05:26:45.050 --> 05:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
someone's convicted or someone has these
 
05:26:47.150 --> 05:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
items it's a misdemeanor but if any such
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
weapon or articles is carried by him not
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
hers it shall be confiscated to the use
 
05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
of the state so I guess the state really
 
05:26:56.090 --> 05:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
needs brass knuckles slug shots and
 
05:26:58.070 --> 05:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
monkey fists of or you know all these
 
05:26:59.690 --> 05:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
items because you know this is how we're
 
05:27:01.368 --> 05:27:01.378 align:start position:0%
going to get them so I don't think this
 
05:27:03.948 --> 05:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
is a really uh important law to keep on
 
05:27:06.170 --> 05:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
our books I think it's uh superficial
 
05:27:07.610 --> 05:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
and actually a silly law to keep
 
05:27:08.868 --> 05:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
considering all the other laws that we
 
05:27:11.750 --> 05:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:17.708 --> 05:27:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:23.530 --> 05:27:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:25.730 --> 05:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of committee
 
05:27:27.230 --> 05:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
make this super fast representative
 
05:27:29.448 --> 05:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
Gerhard Northfield Franklin I just want
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
to support this bill and to address what
 
05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
you said earlier about TSA and brass
 
05:27:36.410 --> 05:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
knuckles I know that people you can have
 
05:27:38.330 --> 05:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
belt buckles with brass knuckles on them
 
05:27:39.770 --> 05:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm pretty sure that would get best
 
05:27:41.150 --> 05:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
if you wanted
 
05:27:43.128 --> 05:27:43.138 align:start position:0%
so and just curiosity say did anyone
 
05:27:47.750 --> 05:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:49.788 --> 05:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
just curious all right thank you very
 
05:27:49.798 --> 05:27:55.550 align:start position:0%
just curious all right thank you very
much

05:27:55.550 --> 05:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:57.170 --> 05:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify and this
 
05:27:59.628 --> 05:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
bill was not testified
 
05:28:02.208 --> 05:28:02.218 align:start position:0%
there's being none uh here I close the
