01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
um good morning and welcome to a work
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
session for the special committee on the
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Children Youth and Family
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
I am representative Erica Leon and I am
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
now serving as the chairman of this
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee and I would like to rep
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
welcome representative David love he is
 
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
a new member of this
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee so as we had our meeting um
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
last time we heard lots of very very
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony we heard people who
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
went through a lot with their families
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
and went through a very difficult
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
process that was not helped by um lack
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
of transparency and not understanding
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
what was going on um I think that this
 
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
committee has great opportunities to
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
make it so the process is better
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
understood and also to find areas where
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
we can help and we can help make it more
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
clear what should happen what shouldn't
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
happen and to make the process easier
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
for people in DCF for the families
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
interacting with them and all the other
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
s all the other people who are involved
 
01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
process um first I want to speak about
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
the administration of Oaths um in RSA
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
1414 the legislature is allowed to
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
administer Oaths um there is no specific
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines about how when where or what
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
is done with those Oaths however there
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
is RSA
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
6411 which is for perjury I do want to
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
stop for a moment and say that part one
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
article 30 of the New Hampshire
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution protects the speech of
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
legislators and not the public when they
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
are in the chambers so when you're
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
testifying into a committee and you are
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
the public your speech is not protected
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
from other courts and other bodies I
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
actually thought that it was um so it
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
was quite enlightening for me to realize
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
that that protection is only for
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
legislators because legislators need to
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
be able to speak and not be afraid of
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
the consequences outside of the
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
consequences of this court of the
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
general court in
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
2017 Oaths were used in disciplinary
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
hearings um when that was going before
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
the legislative Ethics Committee
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
that was a matter of deciding whether to
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
expel people or to take other action
 
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
from members of the general court uh for
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
what was said in the general court and
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
what was done article 30 of the part 1
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
of our constitution says that the
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
freedom of deliberation speech and
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
debate in either House of the
 
01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
legislature is so essential to the
 
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
rights of the people that it cannot be
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
the foundation of any action complaint
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
or prosecution in any other Court or
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
Place whatsoever but that means means
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
that your speech in the legislature can
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
be an action within the general court um
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
and that was a very straight line
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
application of the
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
oath now moving to the idea um of
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
perjury so perjury under RSA 6411
 
01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
provides for a class B felony for false
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
statements under oath or affirmation
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
which are false or inconsistent unless
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
the person believes the statement to be
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
true there's a little bit more into the
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
statute but I just wanted to sort of
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
condense it down to my understanding of
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
that so that we could have a better
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
discussion about that process so a class
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
B felony carries a sentence of up to
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
seven years of prison and up to a $4,000
 
01:05:41.549 --> 01:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
fine um it's quite significant with that
 
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
um Not only would you lose your freedom
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
from that You' also lose your ability to
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
have a firearm you'd lose an opportunity
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
to I believe work in the schools lots
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
and lots and lots of different things um
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
actually the schools I'm not certain but
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
I think I remember at I I think I may or
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
may not be remembering that on the
 
01:05:59.950 --> 01:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
qualifications for
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
teachers so given how serious those
 
01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
penalties are it makes sense that there
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
is a protection for statements that are
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
believed to be true because if a person
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
truly believes that what they're saying
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
is true then they shouldn't be spending
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
seven years in prison if they were
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
wrong that makes it very complicated to
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
pursue and likely very costly both for
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
the state and for the individuals
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
involved to um either bring a perjury
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
charge or defend against a perjury
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
charge there's also the problem about
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's equally applied if
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
perjury is unequally applied to certain
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
viewpoints then that becomes even more
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
problematic and have would have a
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
chilling impact on
 
01:06:47.789 --> 01:06:47.799 align:start position:0%
speech in order to get to that perjury
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
charge I believe that the Attorney
 
01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
General would need to bring charges and
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
given how complex and costly it is um I
 
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:56.839 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would be a challenge
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
for that to happen although in sign in
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
serious and significant cases um it
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
definitely has that
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
pathway so right now we're looking at an
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
issue where we want to make sure that
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
people are truthful so that we know
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
what's going on and that is a lot of the
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
intent of the Oaths um but there's not a
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
straight line path about exactly how it
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be handled even if you knew that
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
somebody was saying something that was
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
not true was inconsistent and that
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
logically they should be able to tell
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
the difference between the two as
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislators we have to make a decision
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
between that and I think that there may
 
01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
be some Parallels for that in the child
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
abuse situations um we actually had a
 
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
what I found to be fascinating debate on
 
01:07:42.269 --> 01:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
the second bill of the calendar on last
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
week on House Bill
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
1659 it really seemed to highlight the
 
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
fact that child abuse allegations um
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
sort of hang around as allegations and
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily brought to a
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
conclusion whether to find that it's
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
unfounded or to bring criminal charges
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
um I heard from people that if there's
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
no broken bones nothing will be done and
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's terrifying it's absolutely
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
terrifying if we had a better process in
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
place we may not know Harmony
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
Montgomery's name because that might
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
have been taken care of and families who
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
have lost their children parents who
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
have been alienated and isolated from
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
them might not have lost their
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
family so if we as a committee are able
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
to look at this and figure out a way to
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
standardize practices and figure out a
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
way to get more clarity then I think
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
that would benefit both those children
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
who are abused and those families that
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
are separated
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily um I think that it draws
 
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
an interesting parallel but I think that
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
that should be our highest
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
priority um so my my biggest part is I
 
01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
want to figure out how we can set guard
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
rails how can we have innocent person be
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
able to clear their name if there's no
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
abuse especially in those cases where we
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
have that bill that's moved on to the
 
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
Senate where there's people who who do
 
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
make malicious reports it happens from
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
time to time not all the time but it
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
does happen how do you clear somebody
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
when it's absolutely absolutely true
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
that everybody that other people
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
witnessed the situation and it did not
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
happen if there's already a policy in
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
place that's great and we have a place
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
to start and then how how what do we do
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
when claims aren't forwarded to the
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
court system if there is something that
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
is a felony because it's assault of a
 
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
child under 13 that should not be kept
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
within the in my opinion that should not
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
be kept within the department there
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be a clear policy where that is
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
forwarded through um obviously there's
 
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
members here that have far more
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge of this than I do but when I
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
was looking through the statutes the
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
district courts have the role of having
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
a hearing and determining whether to
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
forward on criminal charges to the
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts perhaps there needs to
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
be a policy in that perhaps there
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
already is but um I would really love to
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
hear from the members of this committee
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
about their thoughts about this process
 
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
and um hopefully be able to inform me
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
some because uh we have some uh some
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
people with a lot of knowledge in child
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
and family law and um and within the
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and and I'm well aware
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
that I have a small amount of knowledge
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
which is often the dangerous thing um
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's sounds to me uh first of all I
 
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
agree with you that those are areas that
 
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
I think could be looked at uh and other
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
people may have other priorities that we
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
may also decide we want to look at that
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
maybe of higher priority but the two
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
that have been spoken
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
of um I think it would be helpful for us
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
to have people come and explain to us
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
what the actual guidelines are that
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
DCF investigative
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
workers are given for when a case is
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
founded and when unfounded and that may
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
be something that folks from children
 
01:11:07.709 --> 01:11:07.719 align:start position:0%
and family law have already um explored
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
and if if we're breaking new ground you
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
can just give us the benefit of your
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge but I think that that's well
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
worth exploring because I think that
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is the nub of one of the really
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
most difficult aspects of this
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
work and you've you've already set out
 
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
both sides of it on the one side you
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
know the the process can be weaponized
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
um either by parents who are angry or
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
divorc or a neighbor who's angry at
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
their neighbor or anybody else and
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's a very bad thing for the parent
 
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
and the family as a whole on the other
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
hand we certainly want to be sure that
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
um actual cases of abuse are
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
investigated and followed up on and you
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
know one of the things that I'm
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
remembering and I don't know exactly
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
where it sits now now but from my last
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
service on a committee with a similar
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
charge was the issue of can an
 
01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
investigative worker go into the home
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
and under what circumstances and how
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
thoroughly they can look at that and on
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
the one hand we have the protections of
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
the family in the home and on the other
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
hand we have the protection of the child
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
so I'd love to hear more about the
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
current state of affairs and what people
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
think they are allowed to do and not
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to do so I think that's very
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
much worthy of of looking at and then I
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
think that figuring out the referral
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
process because as we know everybody in
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
the state is a mandated reporter so if I
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
suspect abuse I am required even though
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
just a private citizen to report that to
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
dcyf and I know that in many cases dcyf
 
01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
makes a referral uh to the police
 
01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
department for criminal investigation
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
because that's where the criminal
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
charges are investigated and to uh a
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
state's attorney for for
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
prosecution uh it h so I think
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that process better would
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
also be very useful for us as a starting
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
point and I would I would think that
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps at our next meeting we could ask
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
for people to come and help us with that
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you I think that's a wonderful
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
idea and I think we also might want to
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
have the chiefs of police come and speak
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
about how they handle those referrals
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
because we don't know if there the
 
01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
handoff is uh has everything it needs uh
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Greg sorry I
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
turned my name tag back around thank you
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
madam shwom so one thing that you know I
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
want to I want to balance out the fact
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
that I know we want the truth or what
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
people think of the truth one of the
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
things in looking at cases of abuse is
 
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
what people think is abuse I will say as
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
far as um how other states compare and
 
01:13:56.669 --> 01:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire compares are what we um
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
our definitions of abuse are decades
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
behind where other places are and in a
 
01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
lot of times when you talk to someone
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
who has been accused of abuse or even
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
you see court cases or anything like
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
that what you'll notice is a common lack
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
of insight so what I look at and say
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
gosh that kid has a a bruise on his face
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's abuse an abuser might say he was
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
smart off to me and it's my job to teach
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
him a lesson so there's a break in what
 
01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and what is abused so
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's one of those hard things when I
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
look at administering an oath I mean
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's our job to um ask the questions to
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
listen to what somebody wants to say and
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
then also to talk to people that have
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge of particular things because
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
you know what is one person's perception
 
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
is somebody else's very different
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
perception and we get that a lot in
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
child and family law because we do see a
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
lot of abuse and that stuff but there is
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
a Hallmark in abuse ERS and um there are
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
two actually one an abuser will often
 
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
times say they've been abused and also
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
um a lack of insight into their own
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
behavior being Abus so those are two
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
things to keep in mind as we look at
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
this thank you that's helpful that's the
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
cycle of abuse and we need to figure out
 
01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
how to break it
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you I think um related to
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
some of the um topics that you mentioned
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair the um
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
you know there there is the the bill
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
that we just sent over to the other body
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh regarding false reports um I am I am
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
also concerned that
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
um a smart person who who wants to file
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
false reports will perhaps not file
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
false reports directly but will will
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
speak to a mandated reporter and I I've
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
actually heard of instances of this
 
01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.510 align:start position:0%
actually heard of instances of this
happening

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um and
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
dcyf doing what I think is appropriate
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances which is
 
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
investigating those um over and over
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
again um finding no fault over and over
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
again nevertheless I think it is
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
consuming DCF resources and I I'm not
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
sure what the solution to that is but it
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
it it it does seem to me that it's
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
something that ought to be within the
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
purview of this committee as
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
panck thank you um chairman um I heard
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
that 90% of the abuse reports are false
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
allegations how do we tease that out and
 
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
the judges know
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
that judges know that 90% of the abuse
 
01:16:56.719 --> 01:16:57.950 align:start position:0%
that judges know that 90% of the abuse
uh

01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
allegations are there but in order to
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
protect that 10% that it's with is real
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
abuse it seems to me like everybody is
 
01:17:14.669 --> 01:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
paying the price how do we assure that
 
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to continue to happen
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
and I speak from
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
experience um a false allegation that
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
was given about my son and I was there
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
and what was alleged never happened and
 
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
it cost a lot of money to to clean that
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
up and the judge even said they know but
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
they just have to be absolutely certain
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
to protect that other 10% what can we do
 
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
to protect the the innocent
 
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
that yeah I was going to ask a question
 
01:17:58.750 --> 01:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
but well I I just want to be sure that
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
we are understanding the difference
 
01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
between a false report which is
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
materially false as in your case and an
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
unfounded report which is a report where
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
they simply cannot
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
document what happened so I just want
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
all of us to keep that firmly in mind
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry for the interruption and
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's precisely what I was about to ask
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
um do you know if those were if it's
 
01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
that 90% are false or if n if only 10%
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
are found to have
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
abuse if you don't know the number
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay I I think a lot of that
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
is that big area in between the known
 
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
and on either end representative Greg
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then representative gr grman and
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
there's actually different levels of
 
01:18:46.669 --> 01:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
finding so it's not just black or white
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's not just well this is unfounded
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is founded this is false even there
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
are different um there are very
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
different levels and I think that's
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
going be really imperative to have
 
01:18:58.709 --> 01:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
somebody from actually DCF come in and
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
talk to us about that um what levels
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
they have and um I know that on here you
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
even have like how an innocent person
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
can clear their name there are certain
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
things when there's certain levels of
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
findings it's not really a registry it
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
just is in that DCF file so if something
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
comes up again they're looking for a
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
pattern like if okay it might not
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily be founded like somebody's
 
01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
been pinching their child for punishment
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
and leaving bruises so okay now they're
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
going to come back and they're going to
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
tell that parent that's not appropriate
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
parenting now if it happens again it's
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
still in the files they can see this has
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
come up before and that helps but there
 
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
are levels of findings it's not just one
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
way or the other so it's what they can
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
prosecute is what I think was that 10%
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
that can but but there are levels so
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
thank you that's helpful and I
 
01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
definitely want us to learn more about
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
that same question representative Gman
 
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.550 align:start position:0%
that same question representative Gman
representative

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
love yeah thank you madam chair uh I
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
think representative Greg uh hit on
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
something that would uh when you know
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
she was talking about just what is child
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
abuse you know in some states uh you
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
know you can whack your kid in the head
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh other other states you can't uh I
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
think we have to Define that and and
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
punching a child uh should certain to me
 
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
as a felony um you know they they they
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
should do a long stretch of time and uh
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
if and if we had something like that how
 
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
many would be alive today uh also um you
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
know um
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative turn your name Weber
 
01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.470 align:start position:0%
representative turn your name Weber
that's

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh you know she also mentioned that
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
you know the the policies you know I
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
want I want to see the policy Playbook
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
because uh in my experiences it's all
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
over the place it changes and uh you
 
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
know and I'm one of the ones that had
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
that no broken bones no hospitalization
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
there isn't much we can do I had that
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
happen twice there were knuckle marck on
 
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:47.719 align:start position:0%
my daughter's back representative love
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
let's uh make sure that we keep our role
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
on the committee separate from our
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
personal experiences and with the
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
personal experiences whether it's
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
professional or personal um a brief
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
mention is good to know where we are but
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
the more that we get into it I'd like to
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
separate it out so that we can make sure
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
that we're we're keeping clear clear
 
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
boundaries and lines okay I I just
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that you know that
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
there was evidence and um you know uh
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
nothing was done uh was unfounded I was
 
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
told and and that's being told to people
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
I had a woman tell me that a month ago
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
so you know um we've got to clearly
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
Define what is actual child abuse and
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
what isn't thank you representative
 
01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
Gman thank you madam chair and um to
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
piggyback along what representative love
 
01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.470 align:start position:0%
piggyback along what representative love
was

01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
saying you know the definition of what
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
founded in New Hampshire and what
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
unfounded it we'd be remiss to not
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
mention parental rights um and the issue
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
that parental rights have in this right
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
now because Harmony Montgomery was not
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
protected because of parental rights
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
that level is not
 
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
founded um so the laws need to change if
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
we want to protect children in those
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
ways that's up to the general court to
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
but um thank you and this information um
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
is that sometimes there are paral there
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
are concurrent um cases going on one
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
within DCF and one within the criminal
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
courts so this is a lot that you know I
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
I need to learn other people need to
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
learn and um the more that we can
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
discuss this and people can understand
 
01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:41.719 align:start position:0%
what the processes are I think the
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
better because there'll be less misunder
 
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
pure misunderstandings representative
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
Weber and if we want to go further into
 
01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
the layers of complexity a child who is
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
the subject of an abuse and neglect
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
petition um under the dcyf statutes may
 
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
also themselves be the subject of a
 
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
juvenile prosecution for something the
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
child has done so that interjects a jppo
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
juvenile probation for
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
officer I never remember what all the
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
stand for but it's ju juvenile probation
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
officer into the into the mix uh so
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
these are really complicated cases and I
 
01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.950 align:start position:0%
these are really complicated cases and I
applaud

01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
applaud
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
your Clarity and reminding all of us
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
to keep firmly in mind not only between
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
personal and and our roles here but also
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
all the various roles that come into
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
play and they're all in the family court
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
but my my personal opinion is that uh
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
divorces are not in our purview in this
 
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
committee except perhaps as DCF is
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes weaponized in a divorce case
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
which then does become the purview of
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
this committee um so I think all of us
 
01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:05.639 align:start position:0%
are going to have to work really hard at
 
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
being very clear about which aspect of
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
which problem we're talking about at any
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
time because God knows there are enough
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
problems to go around but um the more
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
clarity we have the better we can do at
 
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.229 align:start position:0%
clarity we have the better we can do at
addressing

01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
them yes thank you that is a very good
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
point and this committee also is not
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
focused on the family courts it's
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
DCF um I believe that in this focus and
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
getting more clarity um it's a matter of
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
what feeds into the other systems
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
because if there is a process in order
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
to I guess it's a matter of just
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
understanding the process is best so
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
that we can make sure that everybody's
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
rights are protected through in this and
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
I apologize that I didn't catch
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
everything uh representative Gman on
 
01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
that it was basically just that um your
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
concern that parents rights put Children
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
at Risk sort of or no sorry just the
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
concern that right now the big debate in
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and across the country
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
as well but the whole parental rights
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
versus the rights of the child
 
01:25:08.239 --> 01:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
versus the rights of the child
and

01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:13.109 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
unfounded findings in many cases
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
are situations where there are signs of
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
hitting slapping but it's it's not
 
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
founded by the the level that the law in
 
01:25:28.119 --> 01:25:29.350 align:start position:0%
founded by the the level that the law in
New

01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire calls for and so the the push
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
back to that are parental rights because
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
folks want to maintain their rights and
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
versus that's giving children more
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
rights to protect them oh thank you I
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
think a lot of that comes down to the
 
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
rights and you never have the right to
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
harm any person unless it is in direct
 
01:25:54.669 --> 01:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
self-defense and then that is only in
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
order to stop the harm that is being
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
done um and as I was looking at the
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
statutes assault of a child under 13 is
 
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
treated differently which I don't know
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
what the thoughts were going into that
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
but it's a lot less likely that you're
 
01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
in an actual back and forth physical
 
01:26:11.229 --> 01:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
situation with somebody under 13 than
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
you are maybe a 15-year-old child who is
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
stronger than the parents and knows and
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
knows that they know more than the
 
01:26:20.189 --> 01:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
parents because that's what being 15 is
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
Right representative
 
01:26:26.189 --> 01:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
Weber not I will just say that the the
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse is in the statute
 
01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse is in the statute
and

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
um abused child means any child who has
 
01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
been sexually abused intentionally
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
physically injured which does not have
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
the more nuanced discussions that we've
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
been having which is why we need to
 
01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
understand more about how this is
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
applied psychologically injured uh so
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
that the child exhibit symptoms of
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
emotional problems physically injured by
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
other than accidental means or subjected
 
01:27:09.629 --> 01:27:09.639 align:start position:0%
by any human to human trafficking or
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
subjected to an act prohibited by RSA
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
632 a10d and I have no idea what that is
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure it's terrible um but I
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
think that you know I have some
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge of how the statute evolved at
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
least sort of 10 years ago when we were
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
looking at this because when we started
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
then if you want to talk about
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
Antiquated at that point um under 169 C2
 
01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose the highest purpose was the
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
preservation of the family unit and that
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
was the highest purpose over
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
everything and we are all certainly very
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
much I'm sure in favor of preserving in
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
a family unit but only when it can be
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
done safely and the fight to get the
 
01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:03.639 align:start position:0%
highest purpose to be protect the safety
 
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
of the child was even then very
 
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
controversial um and determining it it's
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
now written determining if the
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
preservation of the family unit is in
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child and of
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
course it it really very often is and
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's what we should be working for so
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
these things change their in flux and
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
they have been been in flux you know
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
forever but I think taking a good look
 
01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:29.669 align:start position:0%
forever but I think taking a good look
at

01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
whether uh they completely reflect what
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
we think of societal values today is
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
important and the other thing is that
 
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know we also have to take into
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
account the fact that my societal values
 
01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
and the values of everybody else in this
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
room are probably somewhat
 
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
different um having been spanked
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
regularly as a child and been proud of
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
it but only when only when I knew it was
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
coming and chose not to stop doing
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
whatever I'd been told not to do and
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
that was a different time and a
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
different way of looking at things um
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
and it was only with the SP with the
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
flat of the hand on a clad bottom so um
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know all of those things make a
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
difference and and societally you know
 
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
we are now a nation where there are
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
awful lot of different kind of cultural
 
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
references representative Greg thank you
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
madam chairman
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that I in in coming
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
into the special committee and I hope
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
this is okay to say what my hopes for
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
was in looking at this I think that
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
there are certainly we've seen both both
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
ends of the spectrum because that's what
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
you hear about the most not you know the
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the middle and what what the the
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
norm is and I I think we can all get
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
ideas you know whether or not you've
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
looked at the harmony Montgomery case
 
01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
and said why did they not do more or you
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
know someone that has been arranged from
 
01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
their kids and why didn't they they do
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
more but like to check that bias at the
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
door and just really listen and I think
 
01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
it would be really helpful to get dcyf
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
in here not under the precursor that
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to be in a tribunal but
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
let's find out like what is their what
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
are their mandates what what does it
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
take for them to intervene are there
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
certain levels what is their follow-up
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
look I'd really like to have one session
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
where we have them in here and we can
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
ask them these questions and ask
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
procedurally what they're required to do
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
or not to do I think that would be
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful if we can kind of
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
check whatever bias we have from the
 
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
news at the door and just say what is
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
this and I think that would be super
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you I agree um as I was
 
01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
looking related to one of the bills that
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
I sat in on a finance they actually do
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
have the policies and procedures manual
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
on for
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
DCF um it's not one document so it's a
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
little hard to do a search and find on
 
01:30:48.669 --> 01:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
it in order to see what we need um I
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
will send a link of that to everybody on
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
the committee and to the administrative
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
rules and then once we're all thoroughly
 
01:30:57.629 --> 01:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
confused we'll have DCF come in and uh
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
try and explain to us what it is that
 
01:31:02.189 --> 01:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
they do uh because because I do know
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
that having it in practice and having in
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
writing sometimes there's a disconnect
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
and sometimes we can help with that
 
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and I just had one
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
other historical note that came into my
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
mind and left again when we had the
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
commission on uh child abuse fatalities
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
10 years ago or whenever it was one of
 
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
the things we discovered was that uh at
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
one of the very early meetings because
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
we had people from DCF and we had people
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
from the local police departments in the
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
room at the same time sitting here not
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
doing anything else and they actually
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
talked to each other uh there was a
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
certain amount of discussion in the
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
audience about how the procedures of one
 
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
of those was not helpful in meshing with
 
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
the other one and they realized just by
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
talking to each other that all they had
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
to do was change their procedures and I
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
think it was around the issue of when
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
things are reported or how particularly
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
in off hours uh but you know when you
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
have those people together with some
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
time where they can focus as opposed to
 
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
doing all the other things it can be
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
really helpful in creating easy and
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
sensible Solutions where there are some
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh leaving us only with the ones that
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
are really really difficult thank you
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
and I agree it's probably those handoffs
 
01:32:29.229 --> 01:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
where we have the most missed
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities um because it is really
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
easy to look at these within silos as
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
they go to different committees and
 
01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
they're dealt with with separate
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
committees um just the perspective is
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
somewhat different and I think that by
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
having this special committee that's not
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily looking at any particular
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
bills we have a better opportunity to
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
talk to everybody who's involved and
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have the appropriate
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
empowerment and the appropriate
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
restraints so that one group isn't
 
01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that somebody else is taking
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
care of certain situations um
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
because because we need to make sure
 
01:33:05.109 --> 01:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
that um that whoever's in the police
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
department handling the reports isn't
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
thinking that it's being taken care of
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
by somebody else and we need to make
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
sure we basically need to make sure that
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
involved thank you um so with this the
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
most important so the takeaways that I'm
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
seeing from this are that I need to set
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
the policies and procedures to everyone
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the administrative
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
rules that we need to schedule a meeting
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
when we can get um probably let's see
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
how many of the stakeholders we can have
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
for that between DCF the office of the
 
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
child advocate who I know is watching on
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
the live stream because they weren't
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
able to be here in person today um
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
and and we'll see who else seems to be
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
an appropriate fit as well but I'll put
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
a big open invitation probably the
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs Association would be
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation fantastic our amazing
 
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
committee researcher has already reached
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
out to make sure that everybody's aware
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
um although she hadn't included the the
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police that was my newer idea
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're also on board
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so with that we'll figure out when we
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
can have sort of a longer meeting that
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
we know the the public won't be won't be
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
coming and bringing any insight but
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
we'll be focusing in on that um so to
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
get all those different groups figure
 
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
out what we need and then ask our
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative long thank you
 
01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair the um I think it's
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
important to see what the communication
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
during all this processes with the
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
family uh that seems to be a
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
Detachment um whether it's the caregiver
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
for the child whether it's the parent
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of communication is
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
out there you know we often hear
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
I didn't know what was going on for
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
three months or I you know I mean it
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
just seems like a basic uh communication
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
issue uh and you know these questions
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
are the million dollar questions they
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
are and then when you get you know you
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
get uh legislation to attempt to fix it
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
and you know it it leans one way or the
 
01:35:20.109 --> 01:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
other protecting the parents or
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
protecting the child you know and that's
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
where the debate ends um but I I think
 
01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
communication is is a key basic that I
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't suspect happens uh and that could
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
resolve a lot of uh a lot of things and
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
also uh with DCF the
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
um you know how many unfounded over a
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
period of five years maybe or three
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
years how many unfounded were bounded a
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
year later not not the same complaint
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
but another complaint you know know and
 
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
how do they address that do they do that
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
data do they calculate gez we've been
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
slipping here you know we got 30% of our
 
01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
unfounded were founded within the LA you
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
know three years later you know do we
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
reassess ourselves um you know how do we
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
drop that number that's a great point
 
01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:14.679 align:start position:0%
and then what services are provided to
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
those families is there a way for them
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
to come and talk to other people and
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
discuss their parenting strategies in a
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
low judgment thing I'm not going to say
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
no judgment because punching a kid in
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
the face deserves as much judgment as
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
you can get and a jail term uh but
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's other areas where there is
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
disagreement about what's appropriate
 
01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
and I think having a conversation with
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
peers and especially with mixed
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint peers um would be a helpful
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
way to better understand um and sorry
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
one other thing for representative long
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
do you think it would also be helpful to
 
01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that in any Communications
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
with families we have just regular
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
people that are involved in in letting
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
us know if they'll actually understand
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
what that paper work is because for
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
those of us here who are used to the
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
legislative words and the forms it's one
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
thing but for your average family going
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
through something that's pretty
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
traumatic it needs we need to make sure
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
that it's actually reaching them where
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
they are do you think that that right I
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
no absolutely I I I do agree U I know
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago or three years ago maybe
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
DCF set up a um constituent um I forget
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
what they call it it's a constituent uh
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
group where within DCF I've been very
 
01:37:26.669 --> 01:37:26.679 align:start position:0%
fortunate people that have called me I
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
turn them over to them and I don't hear
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
back from them so that's that's that's
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
helping relations consti relations okay
 
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you representative Gman
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
I know you've been waiting
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
patiently microphone please take on Casa
 
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
if Casa would be a stakeholder as well
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
that we should welcome to the table
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that's a very good
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
point I we Pro may actually need to have
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
a few different days I don't know if we
 
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
want to start at those that are most at
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
the Nexus and then start spreading
 
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
beyond that because I'm not sure if
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
everybody could take the entire day but
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
if we could do that and then carve out
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
each of the different interactions that
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
may be a really good way to to do some
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
good here representative Greg thank you
 
01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
and I think when we talk about I think
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea to see can people
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
understand this and I I would only
 
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
caution us as we go into that that
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
anybody who's had any kind of trauma in
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
their life whether it's been a death in
 
01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
your family you might look back over
 
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
what you were understanding or what you
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
were thinking at that time and think wow
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
I was basically drunk like I was not
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
responding the way I would there was a
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
study years ago about anesthesia they
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
told people on camera like what the
 
01:38:36.109 --> 01:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
rests of anesthesia were and then had
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
them come in two weeks after their
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
surgery and said um so did you
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
understand and it was in there you're
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
going to be paralyzed like you were
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
paralyzed during the surgery and they're
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
like well nobody told me that and they
 
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:49.159 align:start position:0%
went back they showed them that you know
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
you read this they showed them we talked
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
about this and and they're like No this
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
must have all been doctored so there is
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
something in our brain when we're
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
stressed that kind of shuts off so I
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be interested they might have a
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
way that they think you know works with
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
the lay person but are they are there
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
other things that they're doing besides
 
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
just one way of learning you know one
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
way of talking about it that might might
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
help because we really all do have that
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
block and we kind of get tunnel vision
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
when we're stressed out so that's a very
 
01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
good point I know there was some
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
discussion about the materials that are
 
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to be given to the families
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's a matter of of making sure
 
01:39:25.149 --> 01:39:25.159 align:start position:0%
that those are materials are both
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
accessible and thorough enough um so
 
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.159 align:start position:0%
that people can understand and not get
 
01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed by too much but also be able
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
to get the additional information they
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
need representative Weber and I think I
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
think that there are now um some
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
processes to help with this and the the
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
point that was the same point I was
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
going to make when you were in the
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
middle of a trauma your memory is not
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily what it would be and some of
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
us have memories that aren't what they
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
used to be anyway um and then you know
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
somebody hands you the list of all the
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
things you're supposed to do after
 
01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
surgery or or what's going to happen
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
with your child's case and you take that
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
home and you're upset and that you can't
 
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
find the paper ever again and um I think
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
that having points of accessibility is
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
really important and I know that for me
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
as a as a
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
legislator uh there are both um Woodsman
 
01:40:24.159 --> 01:40:25.550 align:start position:0%
legislator uh there are both um Woodsman
in

01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
DHHS who will listen to people's
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
complaints because they should be and it
 
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
and it's a matter of having people find
 
01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
them and um also uh the office of the
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
child advocate has been an enormous
 
01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
resource for constituents who have
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
brought problems to me and they are
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
often people who are not their own best
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
Advocates but they are also people who
 
01:40:55.589 --> 01:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
have a very valid
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
concern and I again as your experience
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
the people that I have said here's the
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
here's the office of the child advocate
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps you should talk to them and let
 
01:41:08.589 --> 01:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
them know of your concerns both
 
01:41:12.589 --> 01:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
personally and as a systemic issue and
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
because they can then say oh we've had
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
12 complaints about issue a and maybe we
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
better look at it and and those parents
 
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
haven't haven't come back and said yeah
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
there one more person not listening to
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
me so that I think those are the
 
01:41:31.709 --> 01:41:31.719 align:start position:0%
positive avenues that are available for
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
people and how to make sure people are
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
well aware of them um are
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
also fertile ground that's a very good
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
point representative long thank you
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair and on on that
 
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
note I mean I find the
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
employees sometimes stressed out go at
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
it negatively I I you know I you know to
 
01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
it's tough keep it in mind that I'm
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
working for you you know you're you're
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
you're a resident in New Hampshire and
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
I'm working for you um you know so when
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
you diminish that power you know
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
somebody gets C from dcyf their hair
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
steps up in the back of their necks oh
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
my goodness what's going on uh you know
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
that for that cing to occur you'll get
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
better results uh I I I know through my
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
experience having cons call me uh it's
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's been a lack of um you know it's
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
been a lack of uh uh understanding you
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
know or you know I know where you are I
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
can imagine how you're feeling uh I
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
gotta take that in check you know you're
 
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
my 25th call here uh I'm going after you
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
I it's it's a tough thing to do but I I
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
think that's so important that training
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a really good point and
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
then also making sure that if they were
 
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
exposed to really traumatic situation
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
that that's not impacting their view on
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
other because we're all humans and we
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
need to understand our own limitations
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we're not expecting
 
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
these case workers to be super humans
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
right yes representative Weber and I
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
think this is probably also out of our
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
baileywick but I think we ought to keep
 
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
it firmly in mind uh when I was doing
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
this work before the issue was we did
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
not have enough case workers or enough
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
positions and everybody was carrying a
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
case load that was way in excess of
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
recommended case loads uh according to
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized standards by a
 
01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
factor of somewhere between three and 10
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
and now we had a wonderful um bipartisan
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
Coalition that created a lot of new
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
positions now unfortunately we have the
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
positions and we have the funding and we
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
cannot fill the positions so once again
 
01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
we are in that situation where people
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
are often carrying more cases than the
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
Optima and therefore having less time to
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
explain to get to know to establish a
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
rapport and that also leads to less job
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and the kind of issues that
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
you were talking about so that's very
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
real and it's there I'm not sure what we
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
can do about it but we need to keep it
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
in in persp perspective the other thing
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
that the system has been doing if I
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly is starting with
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
the tenure of director
 
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
ribom is trying you know we had one
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
awful case of a father who took his own
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
life and his child's life because he had
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
gone to
 
01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
DCF and was unable to get help because
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
he was not abusing his child he was
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
concerned for his child and he couldn't
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
I mean this makes me want to cry he
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
could not provide di for his child and
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
his in his despair he took both lives
 
01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
and there has been an effort to uh turn
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
the ship around and say oh we're not
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to wait until everything has
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
failed we're we're going to offer
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
services and
 
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
interventions well Upstream So a family
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
struggling has some Services before they
 
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
get to that point of desperation because
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
what we I mean it just seems axiomatic
 
01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
to me that what we ought to be doing is
 
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
making families stronger when they're
 
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
intact and offering them the services
 
01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:35.719 align:start position:0%
that they need to strengthen and bolster
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
the caring that they already have uh
 
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting till things
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
disintegrate because obviously anytime
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
we can keep a family intact and
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
supported that's got to be better for
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
everybody so um you know I think I think
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
the early intervention
 
01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
pieces are again maybe not part of our
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
our remit we can talk about that but I
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
think it's something that we ought to
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
keep clearly in mind is something that
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
has been proven statist you know there's
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
a reason that we hire people out of New
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
Jersey to head
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
DCF they're eons ahead of us and they
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
have worked very hard at at the early
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
intervention side of things because
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's ultimately cheaper and it's
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
healthier for everybody well and I think
 
01:46:30.669 --> 01:46:30.679 align:start position:0%
that brings up a good point early
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
intervention that's asked for or going
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
in and looking for something where your
 
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
child says that you're abusing them
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
because they won't have enough they
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
don't have enough screen time um because
 
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
there there is a significant issue where
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
there are children who believe that they
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
should be treated in a certain way with
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
certain opportunities and and truthfully
 
01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
and authentically feel that that is
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
abuse from their parents by limiting
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
them access to that thing that makes
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
them happy so um a lot of it is just
 
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
things have gotten so out of balance um
 
01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:04.679 align:start position:0%
with kids with families with parents
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
with everybody and it's a matter of
 
01:47:07.709 --> 01:47:07.719 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how we can get
 
01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
things back on track I do like that idea
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
about figuring out a path for people
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
asking for help uh because in those
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
situations especially when there's sort
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
of a binary Choice um here I am and I'm
 
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
struggling and if I'm going to do
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
anything it's that itic how do how do we
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can help those people
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
but also not get involved when it's not
 
01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
an appropriate Choice um and and mam
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
chair that goes back to the various
 
01:47:33.589 --> 01:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
levels of
 
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
founded um you know there are there are
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
letters of concern and things like that
 
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
where that is that is the the entire
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
focus of you know this is not abuse but
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
there are concerns here so we need to um
 
01:47:54.189 --> 01:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
here here are the things that might help
 
01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
in that situation and without having a
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
process for those people who are
 
01:47:59.550 --> 01:47:59.560 align:start position:0%
specifically reaching out for help
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
before giving um sort of an accused
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
thought crime as well for other people
 
01:48:06.109 --> 01:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
too we need to figure out those balances
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
um I when you brought up the point about
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
case load I think that was very
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
important I think that also needs to be
 
01:48:13.589 --> 01:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
balanced with workload because it's a
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
matter of figuring out how these cases
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
are handled and how the how the work
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
process works um I'm curious as to
 
01:48:24.189 --> 01:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
whether whe these are sort of triaged
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
out to different levels of intensity to
 
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
start and once you're triaged into a
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
certain care path um whether or not
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's sort of locked in and baked into
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
the cake if there's more flexibility um
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
and that's something that I'd be really
 
01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
interested in knowing because if things
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
are sort of baked into the cake based on
 
01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
that initial triage what happens if
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
you've been deal if your casew worker
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
just came off of a traumatic case and so
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
they are seeing seeing monsters around
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
every corner just because of what they
 
01:48:55.589 --> 01:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
had previously experienced is a family
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
then triaged into a high level of need
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
when that may not be appropriate and how
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
do you move families from those
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
different levels um if they do exist
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
within that pathway representative
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you madam chair so I I
 
01:49:11.589 --> 01:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
think all of this is very important
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
information for us to have as
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
legislators beyond the scope of this
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee I think it's very important
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
for us to have a deeper knowledge of the
 
01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
the issues and mechanisms around DCF
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
having said that um I I want to just
 
01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
sort of come back to the the mission of
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
this committee is really to focus on due
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
process so I I do believe that these are
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
these topics are being discussed in in
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
so far as they touch on due process so
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
for example you mentioned stress levels
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
a case worker coming off of an
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
especially traumatic case um me I think
 
01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
we we hear about these kinds of
 
01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:56.599 align:start position:0%
situations in police work all the time
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
is you know the the the stress of the
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
moment split-second decision um that
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
there are stresses with these kinds of
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
high conflict jobs and that can
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
potentially impact human behavior
 
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
because we're all human um so I think
 
01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
that in so far as these touch on or
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
somehow impact due process I think they
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
are sort of within the direct purview of
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
the committee I do think that it's good
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
for us to be mindful of and and learn
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
about the the standards and processes
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
and all of this but I I do also want to
 
01:50:36.589 --> 01:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're careful not to um
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
not to engage in too much scope creep as
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
far as the committee's mission is
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
concerned thank you that's a very good
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
point um within this classification and
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
all of that that felt um very direct
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
to-do process but we do need to make
 
01:50:50.669 --> 01:50:50.679 align:start position:0%
sure we don't drift too far from that
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative love thank you thank you
 
01:50:55.229 --> 01:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair um a few things have been
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned here that I'd like to bring
 
01:50:59.310 --> 01:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
the flip side to the coin uh to uh you
 
01:51:00.750 --> 01:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
know representative Weber talked about
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
keeping the family
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
together well with how many Montgomery
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
you had three kids living in the
 
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:07.719 align:start position:0%
backseat of a car mom and dad are
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
shooting dope in the front we missed the
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
line we missed we missed that cut off
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
point we have to Define that in no
 
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
uncertain terms and um you know as a
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and um you know when uh
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
Madam chair was talking about um you
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
know the
 
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh I think we have we need to look at
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
the other end have they become numb and
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
miss and are they missing a lot uh you
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
know that this maybe the maybe some
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
mental health health help for the the
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
order support supporting the team so
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
that they can do a better job
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you I keep
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
saying this is my last thing I'm going
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
to say and then I'm like oh yeah so I
 
01:51:50.669 --> 01:51:50.679 align:start position:0%
think with with the respect to due
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
process I I appreciate and I know that's
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
the focus I don't think you can truly
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
understand what we're going to consider
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
is due process without understanding the
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms of how this entire machine is
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
working because that is due process so I
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
think all these pieces that we've said
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
so far are 100% a part of it because it
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
could even be a lack of understanding of
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
what the process is and stuff so I think
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
we're very much still on the page of
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
where we should be and I appreciate
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
everybody's input on that um thank you
 
01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
and looking at this I think some of that
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
too is that maybe we don't need to get
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
get into the definitions of what abuse
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
is that's something that probably should
 
01:52:28.069 --> 01:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
be handled separately but looking at
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
that process based upon the legislation
 
01:52:32.589 --> 01:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
so we can do that of course if those
 
01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
definitions are so broad that due
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
process is being violated then it would
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
make sense um but if people aren't
 
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
appropriately informed of their rights
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
because they're told once and the
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
information that they're handed isn't
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
handed to them then that's a Clearo
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
process one and comes back to what
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative long was talking about
 
01:52:52.589 --> 01:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
about making sure that people are well
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
informed about the process so I I think
 
01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
that we do need that exploration and
 
01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
then we'll just try and make sure that
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
everything stays within that creep so
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I think I'm I think
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
you've actually gotten to the N of what
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
I was going to say I really don't see
 
01:53:10.589 --> 01:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
how we can go forward given the varying
 
01:53:13.709 --> 01:53:13.719 align:start position:0%
levels of knowledge of what actually
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
happens that are on this committee mine
 
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
is admittedly very old except in very
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
small cases that I deal with but uh I
 
01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
think we need to have a basic
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the current
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
process is because I know that in every
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
discussion that I've ever been part of
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
due process has been a part of that
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
discussion the question is let's find
 
01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
out what we're doing now find out where
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
the slips are and see if changes need to
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
be made because of um what we're seeing
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
in the real world world but I think that
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
until we all have that same Baseline
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
that means that we're all on the same
 
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
page um it's it's uh you know it's for
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
us to make assumptions about what is is
 
01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:08.790 align:start position:0%
us to make assumptions about what is is
not

01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
helpful that is a very good point and um
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
there were very good materials put
 
01:54:15.310 --> 01:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
together under process that we all need
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
to review before we have these
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with DCF Office of the child
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
advocate and everybody who's involved so
 
01:54:24.430 --> 01:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
that we're both looking at the processes
 
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
and making sure that due process is
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
being followed within that
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
path repres I would I would submit that
 
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
finding out what is being done now is
 
01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
the starting point and then examining
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
what is being done now for whether it
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
comports with due process would be the
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
way to go because if we have
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
far-reaching disc discs of due process
 
01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
in the absence of the focus of what's
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
actually happening on the ground I think
 
01:55:03.629 --> 01:55:03.639 align:start position:0%
that that is less helpful and I I think
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
we come at it from two different
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
directions one is hearing from people
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
which we have already started to do and
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
which we'll be doing throughout and
 
01:55:15.149 --> 01:55:15.159 align:start position:0%
hearing from the people whose charge it
 
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
is is the beginning rather than
 
01:55:21.709 --> 01:55:21.719 align:start position:0%
beginning with the due process concept
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
we need to know what's happening and
 
01:55:26.669 --> 01:55:26.679 align:start position:0%
then see if it's falling short or what
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
could be done to improve it thank you
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
and that's why it we need to make sure
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
that we can have an ongoing dialogue an
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing process where um these where
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to have them come back in
 
01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
for more discussion over time so that we
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
can make sure that the policies and
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
procedures are what they need to do that
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
they um work appropriately with all of
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
the other engaged bodies where you're
 
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
expecting somebody else will be handling
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
the situation and making sure that those
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
rights are protected within that because
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
when there's more knowledge of what's
 
01:56:00.430 --> 01:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
Happening you have a much higher
 
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
likelihood of people actually following
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
through and complying with what we're
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
asking for them because if they don't
 
01:56:08.189 --> 01:56:08.199 align:start position:0%
understand what's being asked of them
 
01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's really hard for them to expect them
 
01:56:12.589 --> 01:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
through um so we have five six minutes
 
01:56:19.629 --> 01:56:19.639 align:start position:0%
before the uh we will be opening it up
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
to the public I do want to give a
 
01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
preview of another area that I would
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
like us to work on um we won't be
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
meeting over the summer so if we're
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
digging into this um deep enough and
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
making making great progress that I may
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
may wait on the other one until later um
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
educational neglect is handled within
 
01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
dcyf even though they are not Educators
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
um there have been there's been some
 
01:56:44.109 --> 01:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
work on this in the past um they're the
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
ones who review a homeschooler portfolio
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
to determine whether their progress is
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate given their age and ability
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
um and that seems like a mission creep
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
that's Pro possibly taking away from
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
these other cases where we're talking
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
about physical AB abuse or sexual abuse
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
or something where there is more
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
training from the case workers um the
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
idea of seeing about transitioning that
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
over to the Department of Education may
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
be a better fit uh because quite frankly
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
we asked a lot of our case workers
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
expecting them to be experts in academic
 
01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
childhood development seems to be a
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
stretch especially when we're having
 
01:57:23.709 --> 01:57:23.719 align:start position:0%
trouble those roles and we have case
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
load um we we have case load issues as
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
well so that's something sort of to keep
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the back of the mind I'll get more
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
information to everybody on that as well
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
but I want to make sure that we do have
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate due process for families
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
that are going through um these more
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
physical related issues and by making
 
01:57:43.629 --> 01:57:43.639 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not tasking Cas workers
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
with something that is with outside of
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
their wheelhouse that can have better
 
01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
focus make sure that it is better
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
considered um and just make sure that we
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
are moving things to the correct areas
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
so that one I can I'll leave to the
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
Future um but representative
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
Weber I just want to be sure that we're
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about similar things
 
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.830 align:start position:0%
we're talking about similar things
because

01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
um educational neglect in the sense I
 
01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
mean what what I have seen and heard
 
01:58:15.550 --> 01:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
about with respect to dcyf which doesn't
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
mean that there is another things going
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
on it just means I haven't heard about
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
it is the look at whether a child is is
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
actually being schooled at all and uh
 
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
there are any number of cases that come
 
01:58:33.149 --> 01:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
to dcyf because there is no schooling
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
and that is an issue of neglect I think
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about I would agree
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
with you 100% if we're talking about
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing how a home schooler is being
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
homeschooled and whether that's
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not I wasn't aware that
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
anybody was actually reviewing that so
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
we need to find out more about what's
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
actually happening with that but the the
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
cases that I have heard of in Casa work
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
where there's an issue of educational
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
neglect it has been because not only is
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
the child theoretically enrolled in in a
 
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
public school and not attending but um
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
they also or or they may have because I
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
tend to hear about cases with old
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
children um there are cases where the
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
parent is unable to govern the behavior
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
of their kid and and has said well I'm
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
homeschooling because that's the easiest
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
thing to say and and I think that is a
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
very different case from somebody
 
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
overseeing the whole homeschool process
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
which is something else again um thank
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
you that's a good Insight so this is a
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
process where if somebody has a
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
complaint aain about why are these
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
children in in their yard during the
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
school day that goes to
 
02:00:01.149 --> 02:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
DCF um so homeschoolers and people who
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
simply are not attending school all are
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
funneled into this through the treny um
 
02:00:09.069 --> 02:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
issues so this is one where um after we
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
get a good grasp of what's happening
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
with the um with the whole abuse process
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
then that's something that we can look
 
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
into and get some Buy in from the
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education as well and from
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
all of those that are involved to
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
homeschool legal defense Association has
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
represented families in New Hampshire
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
who have had um some interesting
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
interactions with dcyf regarding
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
educational neglect so balancing all of
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
this makes sense um because quite
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
frankly um we we can get into that full
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
discussion later but the idea that
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're reviewing and trying to
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
understand if a child who um may be
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
working on some more remedial remedial
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
writing skills but they're doing physics
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
at an age that's far soon
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
um if that is appropriate for their age
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
and ability because they can't write to
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
save their life oh they're working on it
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
they're making progress but that's hard
 
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to numbers they're a
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
wizard and I went to MIT there were
 
02:01:06.669 --> 02:01:06.679 align:start position:0%
plenty of kids like
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
that we don't have good social skills
 
02:01:13.629 --> 02:01:13.639 align:start position:0%
either um so with that um I will get
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
those policies and administrative rules
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
out I would like to get an idea of any
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
specific areas where people have
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns so so that we can
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
sort of um let the DCF the office of the
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
child advocate and others who are
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
involved know which areas we um are
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
starting off with some questions but I
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
would like to have an overview from them
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
when we're able to schedule that um we
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
are we can now close our work session um
 
02:01:42.430 --> 02:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
I know everybody's waiting patiently I
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
will um actually open at about um 11:05
 
02:01:48.430 --> 02:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
because I need to run down the hall uh
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
before we start the hearing and I want
 
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everybody from the
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
public who's here in order to share
 
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
their share um with us are appropriately
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
heard so with that we'll start up again
 
02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:50.830 align:start position:0%

02:08:37.870 --> 02:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you and welcome to the regular
 
02:08:39.629 --> 02:08:39.639 align:start position:0%
meeting of the special committee on the
 
02:08:41.069 --> 02:08:41.079 align:start position:0%
department of children youth and
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
families if you saw from our work
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
session we do have people coming in and
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
out because people do have other
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
meetings that are scheduled and some
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
people have certain commitments so if
 
02:08:52.990 --> 02:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who is coming in or
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
somebody who is leaving um during this
 
02:08:57.870 --> 02:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
time please don't take that personally
 
02:08:59.549 --> 02:08:59.559 align:start position:0%
um we have all of this that will be
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
available for review so that everybody
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
will be watching and seeing what you
 
02:09:05.709 --> 02:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
have to say even if you had to leave
 
02:09:07.589 --> 02:09:07.599 align:start position:0%
even if they have to leave to get to
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
another meeting um with that we um we
 
02:09:13.549 --> 02:09:13.559 align:start position:0%
have four people that have given me a
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
card to speak um with the amount of time
 
02:09:18.030 --> 02:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
just so that we can make sure that we
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
can balance everybody's time I will let
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know when you've reached the amount
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
of time that you've requested and then
 
02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
I'll let you finish up with your
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
statement then we will ask you questions
 
02:09:31.470 --> 02:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
um if you feel that you don't have
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
enough you haven't said enough um well
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
first we're all people our brains can
 
02:09:39.790 --> 02:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
only handle so much at one time so it's
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
far more effective for to give us three
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
minutes of information than 10 and far
 
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
more helpful to have 10 minutes in of
 
02:09:49.229 --> 02:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
information than half an hour because we
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
can only retain so much of what you have
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
to say and so by keeping it focused we
 
02:09:57.069 --> 02:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
can get your clear message from you um
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is just always important whenever
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
you're sharing information with others
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
um so the other part is that I know that
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
there is some interest around the area
 
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
of Oaths um the state law allows for the
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
provision of the legislature to
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
administer an oath uh but the only way
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
that that really can be handled and
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
brought forth is under perjury and under
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
perjury which is a class B felony with a
 
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
sentence of up to 7 years in prison and
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
a fine of up to
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
$4,000 um there is protections for
 
02:10:33.709 --> 02:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
statements that are believed to be true
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
even if they are false or inconsistent
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
with other information that makes it a
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
very very difficult case to deal with
 
02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
whether or not you were trying to bring
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
that um from the attorney general or if
 
02:10:48.669 --> 02:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
you were trying to defend against that
 
02:10:51.069 --> 02:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
because there's a Viewpoint difference
 
02:10:52.510 --> 02:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
in and
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and there's the potential of how it
 
02:10:57.709 --> 02:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
could be applied so there is always that
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
challenge um I am coming into this with
 
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
the expectation that people are going to
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
be truthful and give me the information
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
that they can and the information that
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
they want the more that you can back
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
anything up with documents that goes to
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
further reinforce what you say but I ask
 
02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
you to please be careful if you provide
 
02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
any documents they become part of the
 
02:11:20.549 --> 02:11:20.559 align:start position:0%
public record if there are information
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
that you and any that you say here as
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
well is on the YouTube channel that is
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
saved for the legislature and is
 
02:11:30.189 --> 02:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
available to the public as I stated
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
earlier in our work session before many
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
of you arrived part one article part one
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
article 30 of the New Hampshire
 
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution only protects the speech of
 
02:11:41.629 --> 02:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
legislators and not the public in this
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
body um so please be careful of what you
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
do say because I don't want your
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
testimony to then cause problems for you
 
02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
especially if you have Active cases um
 
02:11:53.669 --> 02:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
um I really care that you all are here
 
02:11:55.629 --> 02:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
taking time out of your day to talk with
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
us and help us to try and improve due
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
process within DCF but I also want to
 
02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:04.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that um I I just want to make
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody is as safe and
 
02:12:07.629 --> 02:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
protected as
 
02:12:10.549 --> 02:12:10.559 align:start position:0%
possible so um with this I will not be
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
administering Oaths people may say
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
whatever they would like in their
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
testimony and representative
 
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
Weber and I just had one other point of
 
02:12:22.709 --> 02:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
clarification if you approve of it Madam
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
chair which is that it seemed to me that
 
02:12:26.669 --> 02:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
at some
 
02:12:30.510 --> 02:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
points uh in earlier testimony we went
 
02:12:33.229 --> 02:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
farther a field into the entire family
 
02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
court process and I understand that they
 
02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:36.750 align:start position:0%
court process and I understand that they
are

02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
interrelated but it seems to me that the
 
02:12:46.350 --> 02:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
um charge of this committee is DCF so if
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
there is a concern about DCF being uh
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
weaponized in a divorce casee that is
 
02:12:57.149 --> 02:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
something we ought to know about but
 
02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
just the process of people's divorces or
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
other family court matters of which
 
02:13:05.709 --> 02:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
there are any number are outside of our
 
02:13:09.310 --> 02:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
our scope um so what we need to do is
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
focus very carefully on on the
 
02:13:13.950 --> 02:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
interactions with dcyf and how that
 
02:13:16.589 --> 02:13:16.599 align:start position:0%
impacts the lives of whoever's testim
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
testifying thank you that is a very good
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
point if you're getting into court
 
02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:21.629 align:start position:0%
point if you're getting into court
procedure

02:13:21.629 --> 02:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
02:13:24.669 --> 02:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
um while there is a there there may very
 
02:13:27.149 --> 02:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
likely be a due process tie-in we are
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
trying to focus on the dcyf involvement
 
02:13:32.830 --> 02:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
and um almost what I think of is the
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
feeder system uh Because unless there's
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
an interaction with DCF you're not in um
 
02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
that's that seems to be what um is part
 
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
of the process for people who have had
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
challenges in the family courts so I'd
 
02:13:48.030 --> 02:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
like to keep this um focused more on the
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
dcyf aspects of this um and as I said
 
02:13:55.629 --> 02:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
before I I saw one card that um is is on
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
the longer side um there are several of
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
us that do have other appointments and
 
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
other meetings so that if anybody leaves
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a personal issue um and so
 
02:14:08.990 --> 02:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
first I will call Representative Leah
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
minutes your microphone's not on
 
02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:23.559 align:start position:0%
I swear to tell the truth the whole
 
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
truth and nothing but the truth so help
 
02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.470 align:start position:0%
truth and nothing but the truth so help
me

02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
God thank you madam
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
chair um so sitting here listening um as
 
02:14:39.149 --> 02:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
you all know I asked the speaker for
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
this committee after the people
 
02:14:43.470 --> 02:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
instructed me to Via notices that they
 
02:14:48.109 --> 02:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
provided drawing attention and making um
 
02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:51.559 align:start position:0%
showing uh controverting evidence
 
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
that due process as required by part one
 
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
Article 15 of the New Hampshire City
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution is being
 
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
violated it's not being
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
provided before you take any Liberties
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
or rights from people you must find
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
guilt by a trial by
 
02:15:11.950 --> 02:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
jury that's in a court of record that
 
02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
moves by common law everything else that
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
is being talked about right now is
 
02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
extraneous details fact finding is done
 
02:15:23.709 --> 02:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
by juries um you know whether uh the
 
02:15:25.390 --> 02:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances of a case provide for
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
leniency that's determined by a
 
02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
jury so we're get the committee is
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
getting way off track and to say that
 
02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:33.870 align:start position:0%
getting way off track and to say that
Family

02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
Family
 
02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
Court discussion has to be limited is
 
02:15:38.709 --> 02:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
totally antithetical to the whole point
 
02:15:41.069 --> 02:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
of this committee it's about due process
 
02:15:42.549 --> 02:15:42.559 align:start position:0%
related to
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
DCF and DCF takes children by bringing a
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
petition to Family Court where there is
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
no trial by jury and the facts are not
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
found by a jury and it doesn't move
 
02:15:56.830 --> 02:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
under common law and the
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
evidence is picked and choosed as to how
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
weighed okay so all of those things are
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
way off track the first thing that the
 
02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee need to
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
understand is you already all swore oath
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
to protect those rights under part one
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
Article 15 you swore already now you've
 
02:16:20.549 --> 02:16:20.559 align:start position:0%
been given notice now you're receiving
 
02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
it again
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
you swore if you break that you're
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
breaking the
 
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
contract okay that's
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
maladministration so that is the main
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this committee is to
 
02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that the people are getting trial
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
by jury before they're I mean think of
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
it losing a child is akin to capital
 
02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
punishment that's something that needs
 
02:16:46.349 --> 02:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with in a trial by jury you
 
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:47.599 align:start position:0%
can't take rights you can't take
 
02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
Liberties need a trial by jury um
 
02:16:55.870 --> 02:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that can change this
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
um at maybe part one Article 15 should
 
02:16:59.950 --> 02:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
be read every five minutes in this
 
02:17:02.190 --> 02:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
committee so it keeps your eye on the
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
ball um after hearing at the last
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the testimony of Andrew Noyes
 
02:17:10.230 --> 02:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
um it laid out very eloquent eloquently
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
what is required by the Constitution so
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
I recommend going back and listening to
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
that maybe transcribing it and keeping
 
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
it taped in front of you um I reached
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
out to to to dcfb email after last uh at
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
after the last meeting and I and I said
 
02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
after I heard what I heard today I I can
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
only conclude that what's happening is
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
very unlawful and please I'm bringing it
 
02:17:35.709 --> 02:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
to your attention as well please make it
 
02:17:38.669 --> 02:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
stop um I asked I'm going to extend you
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
to 10 minutes because you're already at
 
02:17:42.669 --> 02:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
three minutes so wow okay thank you
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're welcome um the legislature used
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
to hear this is really what's going on
 
02:17:49.629 --> 02:17:49.639 align:start position:0%
is is the people are coming and
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
saying Hell help our rights are being
 
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
violated you promised that you would
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have these rights at all
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
times and that you would be at all times
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
accountable to us and that if there is
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
um an abreg of Rights happening that
 
02:18:08.589 --> 02:18:08.599 align:start position:0%
without delay we would deal with it and
 
02:18:11.469 --> 02:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
it's been lost throughout history uh in
 
02:18:12.990 --> 02:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
the way that things have been run in
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
this in this body but redress of
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
grievance is our first job in the
 
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution writing laws is second and
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of this country and the
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
the very first Act was to deal with the
 
02:18:30.030 --> 02:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
redress of grievance and then all the
 
02:18:32.549 --> 02:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
Committees that formed were not subject
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
matter committees they were committees
 
02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
named after the person whose issue had
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
been brought forth they met sometimes
 
02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
they would make special acts just to to
 
02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
fix this per thing this wrong for this
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
one person you know this is completely
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
doable um and and you'll get
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get too far off
 
02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
but that that's really your main job
 
02:18:59.509 --> 02:18:59.519 align:start position:0%
here is to ensure the Constitutional
 
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
protections of the people all the other
 
02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:02.389 align:start position:0%
protections of the people all the other
stuff

02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
02:19:06.429 --> 02:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
like a a jury of your peers is the best
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
body to determine
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
of uh whether you've committed a harm
 
02:19:15.870 --> 02:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
that deserves severe punishment or you
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
know lesser punishment juries find the
 
02:19:20.429 --> 02:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
facts they're they're a representative
 
02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
body of the people as well and and that
 
02:19:25.950 --> 02:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
trial by jury is such an integral part
 
02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
of um our rights in this in this country
 
02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
I mean the the courts of common pleas
 
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
existed here before the um instituting
 
02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
of of this form of government the
 
02:19:38.589 --> 02:19:38.599 align:start position:0%
Republican government so I mean it's
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
carried from from the English common law
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
and and the the the fundamental
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
principles behind the Constitution are
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
the common law and the constitution in
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
part one article 30 says the people um
 
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
it says a frequent recurrence to the
 
02:19:56.110 --> 02:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
fundamental principles of the
 
02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution and a constant adherence to
 
02:20:01.469 --> 02:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
Justice moderation Temperance industry
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
frugality and all social virtues are
 
02:20:05.790 --> 02:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
indispensably necessary to preserve the
 
02:20:07.469 --> 02:20:07.479 align:start position:0%
blessings of liberty and good government
 
02:20:09.389 --> 02:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
that's what the people did with those
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
notices they pointed us to the
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental principles and and they're
 
02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're saying help us now fix this so
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
for for dcyf to have
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
um administrative
 
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
tribunals where they find fact they
 
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
they're acting as investigator which is
 
02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
usually um executive branch function
 
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
right law enforcement then they're
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
acting as the judge and jury and they're
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.190 --> 02:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
penalty in the form of putting you on
 
02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.070 align:start position:0%
penalty in the form of putting you on
that

02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
registry which limits your job um
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
abilities volunteer abilities maybe
 
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
potentially your custody of your
 
02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
children if you get divorced
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
later all of that steps into the realm
 
02:20:55.469 --> 02:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
of Taking
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
Liberties and it requires a trial by
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
jury there's a federal case um that was
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
already uh found ruled in against the
 
02:21:07.389 --> 02:21:07.399 align:start position:0%
SEC it's SEC versus Jesy and it's in the
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court now and it's looking at
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
this too um Congressman Thomas Massie
 
02:21:15.550 --> 02:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
just had a reigning in the
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
administrative um State kind of
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
committee that is looking at these
 
02:21:23.070 --> 02:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
issues too and he received notices and
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
so the you take the instructions and you
 
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
you follow what the people are telling
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
you um if they're showing you that their
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
rights that you swore to protect are not
 
02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
being protected and and stay focused on
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
that and stay focused on what the trust
 
02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
IND denture that is the New Hampshire
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution that all of the
 
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
Constitutions are their Express trust
 
02:21:46.990 --> 02:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
what they say in part two is is what is
 
02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
um you know how government is to operate
 
02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
in part one
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
is reserve back to the people we're not
 
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to drift into any part of part
 
02:21:58.830 --> 02:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
one to to mess with it or or you know
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
shortcut it you have to keep it the way
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
the way it
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
is um so DCF if they if they get a call
 
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
the way I see it they get a call um they
 
02:22:12.990 --> 02:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
go in they can they can ask voluntarily
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
to to work with the family and see you
 
02:22:16.510 --> 02:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
know we understand there's problem going
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
on um and the family can voluntarily
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
work with them but if not you you have
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
to get you have to do a sworn affidavit
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
to confer jurisdiction to the court for
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
them to then issue a warrant and then
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
have an investigation so like you you
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
can't even have a warrant without
 
02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
someone making an accusation and
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
actually in this state everyone is a
 
02:22:41.309 --> 02:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
mandated reporter um it's not just
 
02:22:43.150 --> 02:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
that's just a common misconception that
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
it's only certain people and
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
professionals and I just wanted to throw
 
02:22:49.630 --> 02:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
that out there um it's a side point but
 
02:22:52.110 --> 02:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
you know and also would prevent
 
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
frivolous and you know retaliatory and
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
malicious um claims and accusations
 
02:23:00.750 --> 02:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
being filed and then not being held
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
accountable because you know file uh
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
filing a false police report or um
 
02:23:08.830 --> 02:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
committing perjury and an affidavit you
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
know those are crimes those can be held
 
02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
accountable too in Criminal Court um so
 
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
I I just look at you
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
know you've got to bring them into a
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
court of record where the magistrate is
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
independent of the cause at hand meaning
 
02:23:24.750 --> 02:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
they're not getting paid by the same
 
02:23:27.309 --> 02:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
program as who brought the cause forward
 
02:23:30.269 --> 02:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
they're um they're not uh a part of the
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
same agency that brought it Forward
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
right every they have to be impartial
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
the jury uh is chosen from their peers
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
you know all the facts are are um tested
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
by the jury and all of this is is
 
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
underpinned and and the court is moved
 
02:23:48.030 --> 02:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
by common law in criminal court and in
 
02:23:50.110 --> 02:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
Civil Court that's how it's supposed to
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
be but but these statutes have been
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
implemented that sidestep that and it's
 
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
all now in
 
02:23:59.950 --> 02:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
void so it needs to be um it needs to be
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
completely redone and thrown away and
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
and and fixed um as far as you know
 
02:24:08.349 --> 02:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
there's a maximum of law that says
 
02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
prevention is better than cure there's a
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
lot of people have already been very
 
02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
severely hurt by these unconstitutional
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
courts and the state of New Hampshire
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
might be liable in the future for what
 
02:24:22.950 --> 02:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
occurred there if it's true that and and
 
02:24:25.469 --> 02:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
I fully believe that it is that how it's
 
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
being done is not constitutional um so
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
we got to consider that and then the
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
very real harms to the families on both
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
sides because um if you have an
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
impartial tribunal that's actually
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary with a real judge and jury um
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
you know it not only will it be more
 
02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to um for someone's subjective
 
02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
like gatekeeping to let a a real
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
harm get be gotten away with um but
 
02:24:59.469 --> 02:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
either way you know what I mean
 
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
like it it also will prevent innocent
 
02:25:04.349 --> 02:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
people from from being
 
02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
prosecuted thank you that's uh been 10
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
minutes um I do want to read for
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
everybody um part first Article 15 no

02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%

02:25:23.269 --> 02:25:23.279 align:start position:0%

02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
himself every subject shall have the
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%

02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%

his peers or the law of the land
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
provided that in any proceeding to
 
02:25:49.469 --> 02:25:49.479 align:start position:0%
commit a person acquitted of a criminal
 
02:25:51.630 --> 02:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
charge by reason of insanity due process
 
02:25:53.269 --> 02:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
shall require the clear and convincing
 
02:25:55.349 --> 02:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
evidence that the person is potentially
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous to himself or to others and
 
02:25:59.230 --> 02:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
that the person suffers from a mental
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
disorder must be established every
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
person held to answer in any other crime
 
02:26:05.469 --> 02:26:05.479 align:start position:0%

02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%

02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
counsel at the expense of the state if
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
need is shown this right he is at
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
Liberty to wave but only after the
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
matter has been thoroughly explained by
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
the court uh so my question to you is um
 
02:26:20.429 --> 02:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
in order to understand if that is being
 
02:26:22.269 --> 02:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
done is it reasonable to find out the
 
02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
policies and the procedures and the
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
intersection between everybody
 
02:26:30.670 --> 02:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
involved um I think it's already been
 
02:26:34.429 --> 02:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
presented that that the way DCF is doing
 
02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
things and the way the legislature set
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
things up is um Incorrect and so now
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
we're all aware of it so whatever the
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures are um they're
 
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
secondary you just have to move forward
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
and start and just put everything
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
everything you know DCF needs to to get
 
02:26:57.309 --> 02:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
um sworn affidavits and and bring it to
 
02:26:58.750 --> 02:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
the court they know how to do that
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
they've done it you know I've read cases
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
where they did that um so respectfully I
 
02:27:07.230 --> 02:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
think it's it's already been presented I
 
02:27:08.830 --> 02:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
think that all the policies and
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
procedures will have to be redone later
 
02:27:13.950 --> 02:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
in the perspective of keeping in line
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
with this um with with part one Article
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
15 and the rest of the
 
02:27:22.349 --> 02:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.429 --> 02:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
and I did I did just want to make if I
 
02:27:27.070 --> 02:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
may Madam chair one more um there's one
 
02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
other question willia gets you there
 
02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:30.590 align:start position:0%
other question willia gets you there
representative

02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
Weber are you aware that every single
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
dcn DCF
 
02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
case starts in court with a sworn
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
affidavit that's good but why doesn't it
 
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
stay there and then proceed to a trial
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
by jury that's where it goes wrong if
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's how it starts
 
02:27:53.950 --> 02:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
then that's the accuser and then the
 
02:27:55.469 --> 02:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
person has a right to face that accuser
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
under due process um I think the
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee needs to really understand
 
02:28:03.469 --> 02:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
what um the what common law due process
 
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
is and common law is just those
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental principles they're the
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
maxims of law as an attorney I'm sure
 
02:28:09.870 --> 02:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
you're very familiar with them the
 
02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
established maximums they're basically
 
02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
the the laws of Law and they're what um
 
02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
judges Ed to help guide juries in in
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
finding fact and making decisions as
 
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
well as um the rulings of of Courts so
 
02:28:29.269 --> 02:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
that all of that comes together to
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
provide what has been consistently and
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
through custom and usage over time shown
 
02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
to be um fair and constitutional due
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
process so that's what I would say is is
 
02:28:45.790 --> 02:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
from there they should be taking charges
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
you can't be soft on crime and then um
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know not you're on one side being
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
soft on crime by bringing it into a
 
02:28:58.110 --> 02:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
quasi civil quasi criminal venue right
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
where they don't get a criminal penalty
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
um and you you're kind of stringing them
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
along for a year and a half or however
 
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
long with all these hearings and they
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
might get a chance and they go through
 
02:29:12.030 --> 02:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
therapy and they do this and that um but
 
02:29:15.630 --> 02:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's all Sid stepping you know if a
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
parent knows that if they hurt
 
02:29:20.590 --> 02:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
someone that they're going to be
 
02:29:23.269 --> 02:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
criminally charged that's quite a
 
02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
disincentive it's quite an incentive to
 
02:29:30.670 --> 02:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know be doing the right thing um
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
on top of
 
02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
it so you're you're soft on crime on one
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
side in in those in those tribunals and
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
then in the in the family court and the
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
way it's done and then on the other side
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
we're saying well a lot of kids are left
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
to be harmed well I mean that's why it's
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
because the facts aren't being found the
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional way the founders were
 
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
very smart and and this um trial by jury
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know was consistently shown to be
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
like a just such a
 
02:30:00.510 --> 02:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
foundational requirement of our form of
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
government and Society at at the
 
02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
founding and going back to England thank
 
02:30:07.630 --> 02:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
you uh follow up from representative
 
02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
Weber and then representative Greg thank
 
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
you and I'm I'm reminding myself that
 
02:30:14.830 --> 02:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
this is not the time to dialogue about
 
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
my beliefs versus your beliefs because
 
02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
they are very different but my
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
and we will have that discussion in a
 
02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
work session which is where it's
 
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate my second question to you is
 
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the fact that dcyf
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
proceedings are not criminal in nature
 
02:30:37.269 --> 02:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
they are not held in the criminal court
 
02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
and they are a different kind of
 
02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:41.230 align:start position:0%
and they are a different kind of
proceeding

02:30:41.230 --> 02:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
entirely yes thank you they are
 
02:30:47.710 --> 02:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
administrative tribunals and they are
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional thank you
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
02:30:53.469 --> 02:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious and in what you posed
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
and um are saying is necessary for uh
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
somebody to be accused or have their
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
children taken
 
02:31:03.309 --> 02:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
away I guess I'm missing the point where
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
the child's constitutional right comes
 
02:31:08.550 --> 02:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
in as far as being able to be safe and
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
have their own rights do the parents
 
02:31:13.309 --> 02:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
rights and their ability to go to court
 
02:31:15.750 --> 02:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
and have this H whole jury trial
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
supersede any danger to the child like
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
because those are those are a process
 
02:31:21.269 --> 02:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
you you have to pick a jury you have to
 
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
get lawyers like you're talking months
 
02:31:25.950 --> 02:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
or years so how does that work in
 
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
protecting kids so it's kind of a trick
 
02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
question um the child's rights are being
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
protected when someone puts in a sworn
 
02:31:40.429 --> 02:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
affidavit seeking due process to get a
 
02:31:41.950 --> 02:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
penalty for this child and get this
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
child safe so if that parent then is
 
02:31:47.710 --> 02:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
arrested because of that evidence in the
 
02:31:50.030 --> 02:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
form of a sworn affidavit they go to
 
02:31:52.349 --> 02:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
jail their child goes to the next of kin
 
02:31:54.389 --> 02:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
if they don't have next ofkin then
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's a place for this for DCF to come
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
in and get involved but I mean you
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we have bail that's why we
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
have preliminary hearings um there's
 
02:32:09.389 --> 02:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
likely a constitutional way to keep a
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
child safe while the due process is
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
being carried out but that's why due
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
process also is supposed to be prompt
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
without delay you know you're supposed
 
02:32:21.150 --> 02:32:21.160 align:start position:0%
to have a speedy trial we have all these
 
02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
protections a follow up from
 
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative Greg yes thank you and by
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
the way thank you I forgot to thank you
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
earlier and thank you for taking our
 
02:32:30.429 --> 02:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
questions and for being here so in this
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
um didn't like lose my turn of thought
 
02:32:36.590 --> 02:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh the problem is when you're
 
02:32:38.190 --> 02:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
investigating something and I don't know
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
if you heard me earlier that what one
 
02:32:42.429 --> 02:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
person might think is abuse another
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
person sees as um well I'm just child
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
rearing this is my right to knock my kid
 
02:32:49.150 --> 02:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
into next week if they're not behaving
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever so so there has to be an
 
02:32:53.150 --> 02:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
investigation done so you wouldn't rest
 
02:32:55.309 --> 02:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
arrest somebody before an investigation
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
is done and I think that's what the
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
process is now how would that work
 
02:33:02.309 --> 02:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to just arrest
 
02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
everybody that gets accused without
 
02:33:06.309 --> 02:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
proper I would think that would be more
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
offensive to their rights of just being
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
arrested when we're trying to do an
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
investigation so where's that balance on
 
02:33:14.590 --> 02:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
that um well I guess that's a good
 
02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
question but it's uh kind of a
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about how criminal
 
02:33:20.070 --> 02:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
investigations are done usually people
 
02:33:22.389 --> 02:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
are arrested when they have preliminary
 
02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
evidence and that that uh affidavit
 
02:33:28.590 --> 02:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
would provide that the jurisdiction for
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
the court to then issue a warrant for
 
02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
that person to be arrested and then any
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to um you know before or during
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
the the arrest or after it interfere
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
with the ability for the investigation
 
02:33:42.269 --> 02:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
to be carried out um that would be
 
02:33:44.269 --> 02:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
problematic problematic for the person
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
who is trying to stop that um and anyway
 
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the interim the child either the
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
parent would be in
 
02:33:54.030 --> 02:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
jail awaiting trial um or they would be
 
02:33:55.389 --> 02:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
out on bail and likely would have
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
preliminary orders from a judge that
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
child thank you very much for coming and
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
sharing with us I hope you stay involved
 
02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um traditionally um we will
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
hear Representatives first my question
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
though representative Horgan do you have
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
other committee business because we had
 
02:34:15.710 --> 02:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
a few come in before
 
02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
you if you don't if you wouldn't
 
02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay I will set a two-minute timer and
 
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
hold you to that is that all right
 
02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:32.910 align:start position:0%
hold you to that is that all right
representative

02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
microphone so I'm representing Timothy
 
02:34:42.030 --> 02:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
Horan from straford County District 10
 
02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham and um you don't
 
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
really have an enviable job ahead of me
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
I was part of a similar initiative
 
02:34:52.429 --> 02:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
um well back my second term which was a
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
long time ago 2011 to 2012 the petitions
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
and redress committee and that's why I
 
02:34:59.070 --> 02:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
put in the pink card because resent
 
02:35:01.469 --> 02:35:01.479 align:start position:0%
quman referred to that El of the
 
02:35:04.910 --> 02:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution and we ran into many guess
 
02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
many many problems one was you know it
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear what our procedures were
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
which I guess uh it's a little bit
 
02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
clearer for for your group but also um
 
02:35:15.790 --> 02:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
we mostly dealt with similar disputes
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
and also people about DCF which
 
02:35:20.670 --> 02:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
certainly is not perfect but
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
um we often hear from only one parent
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
when there's another parent and other
 
02:35:27.309 --> 02:35:27.319 align:start position:0%
family members involved so the f is
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
families and also we have children and
 
02:35:31.349 --> 02:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
youth so the children are human beings
 
02:35:33.750 --> 02:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
their own right and have their own have
 
02:35:37.389 --> 02:35:37.399 align:start position:0%
their own concerns um which often um get
 
02:35:40.750 --> 02:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
lost in the shuffle so and that's uh one
 
02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
thing to keep in mind also people often
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
tend to do do data dumps on it which I
 
02:35:47.309 --> 02:35:47.319 align:start position:0%
think I looks like that's happening
 
02:35:49.349 --> 02:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
today where they provide a voluminous
 
02:35:53.230 --> 02:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
amount of amount of material which um
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
may or may not support the conclusion
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
that respected the draw from is just
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
there's a huge stack of paper doesn't
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that what's being said
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
is is is is accurate and we um we didn't
 
02:36:07.830 --> 02:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
put people under oath either that's a
 
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
wise decision on your part not to Madam
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
chair but um people would often
 
02:36:13.870 --> 02:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
certainly submit affidavits and those
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
affidavits first of all sometimes even
 
02:36:17.070 --> 02:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
the facts that people swear to an
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
affidavits are false and often the
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
material they put in the affidavit is
 
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
not really factual either it's just our
 
02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
conclusions about the law and that's uh
 
02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
just because you put an affidavit and
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
then may put a bunch of gassy prologues
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
on it doesn't necessarily mean that that
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
document is of of any relevance so
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's something else to keep in contact
 
02:36:37.630 --> 02:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
with and also something we struggled
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
with and was just sort of the
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the data because
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
people often submit you know very um
 
02:36:45.389 --> 02:36:45.399 align:start position:0%
personal information which maybe is not
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily appropriate to be passing
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
around in an open house committee proced
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
seing so um anyway good luck you you
 
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
won't be able to sort this out before
 
02:36:56.590 --> 02:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
the end of the session but maybe you can
 
02:36:58.429 --> 02:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
make a little bit of progress so thanks
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to say basically
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative orgon
 
02:37:03.870 --> 02:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
I I realized we have a challenge in
 
02:37:06.030 --> 02:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
front of us and you were just about on
 
02:37:10.030 --> 02:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:14.429 --> 02:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
you yes um next we have Robert leontin
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
um I had already had you next in the
 
02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
stack um I do see that you're from
 
02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
Vermont in the future I think think
 
02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be limiting testimony to
 
02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
people from New Hampshire since this is
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire DCF unless they've had
 
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
involvement with New Hampshire DCF but U
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
Mr lontine um you've asked for 10
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
minutes so I'll have my little timer let
 
02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know when you're there so then you
 
02:37:42.030 --> 02:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for listening to
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
me my name is Robert
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
lontine I'm originally from New
 
02:37:53.710 --> 02:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was born in nton in
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
1964 I left New Hampshire because I got
 
02:37:58.190 --> 02:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
strong armed out of this state because
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the state laws that they

both physically and mentally and
 
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
things it's hard for me to come up here
 
02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
and talk with a bunch of strangers that
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
I don't even know about what I went
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
through I can imagine all the other
 
02:39:37.070 --> 02:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of people that
 
02:39:39.269 --> 02:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
are out there that have been in the same
 
02:39:41.790 --> 02:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
position as I am that are not strong
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
enough to come up here and throw a
 
02:39:46.349 --> 02:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
backbone and tell the public about
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
what's going
 
02:39:48.319 --> 02:39:55.150 align:start position:0%
what's going
on

02:39:55.150 --> 02:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:58.349 --> 02:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know what else to say other than
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that I'm not going to stop if I
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
got to keep coming to these hearings
 
02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
once a month and testify against you
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
guys I
 
02:40:12.630 --> 02:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
will but something has to be done about
 
02:40:15.469 --> 02:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
this if we let the people that did test
 
02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
through all of us get away with this
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
then you
 
02:40:25.309 --> 02:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
give Joe and Jane public the etern of
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
right to do the same damn thing to any
 
02:40:29.429 --> 02:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
one of
 
02:40:32.269 --> 02:40:32.279 align:start position:0%
them that's all I got to
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
say Thank you Mr lontine I'm so sorry
 
02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
for everything that you went through and
 
02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
that your family went through with this
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
um specifically it sounds like making
 
02:40:45.070 --> 02:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
sure that all evidence is presented in a
 
02:40:47.710 --> 02:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
timely way and that thing a trial is
 
02:40:51.269 --> 02:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
Speedy though with those two things that
 
02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
um would be important to address in
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
order to make you realiz make make you
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
understand that we're trying to make
 
02:40:58.750 --> 02:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
sure that nobody else has to go through
 
02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
a situation like that I don't know what
 
02:41:03.389 --> 02:41:03.399 align:start position:0%
to believe anymore I just don't
 
02:41:05.790 --> 02:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
know thank you it's got to be hard
 
02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:09.349 align:start position:0%
know thank you it's got to be hard
representative

02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%

significant strides and people are
 
02:41:41.550 --> 02:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
working now and going forward on
 
02:41:45.190 --> 02:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
ensuring issues of credibility of the
 
02:41:46.990 --> 02:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
members of the police force that come
 
02:41:49.630 --> 02:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
and testify and that they are are no
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
longer protected when they have

God because God does exist God is nature
 
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's the foundation of our
 
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution which was created prior to
 
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution four years prior and
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
afterwards we got our Fourth Amendment
 
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
protections the Constitution protects us
 
02:44:24.469 --> 02:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
from the government which the government
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
is just people and people always do
 
02:44:29.670 --> 02:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
what's in their best perceived interest
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
they're always going to do what they
 
02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
feel is right
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
Justified and then we have laws we have
 
02:44:43.710 --> 02:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
constitutions um as as speaking uh prior
 
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh someone uh I think it was rep Greg
 
02:44:48.389 --> 02:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
was talking about the child's rights and
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
if you read the the Constitution if
 
02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
youve ever been despoiled of anything
 
02:44:53.230 --> 02:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
you read the Constitution it will make
 
02:44:55.349 --> 02:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
You Weep
 
02:44:58.389 --> 02:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
because it was done to protect us
 
02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
article two natural rights all men have
 
02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
certain natural essential and inherent
 
02:45:05.070 --> 02:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
rights among which are the enjoying and
 
02:45:09.150 --> 02:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
defending of life liberty acquiring
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
possessing and protecting property and
 
02:45:13.910 --> 02:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
in a word seeking and obtaining
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%

happiness now I want to bring back to
property

02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:45:21.230 --> 02:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
because the uh the family unit women and
 
02:45:22.910 --> 02:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
children used to be considered property
 
02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
in Constitution they and and you might
 
02:45:28.429 --> 02:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
say that that's a horrible thing but
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
they did they still don't have to
 
02:45:32.670 --> 02:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
register for Selective Service women
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%

able to do everything men can do um
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
based on your own
 
02:45:45.349 --> 02:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
abilities but this property the family
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
unit the courts are not looking at this
 
02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:50.870 align:start position:0%
unit the courts are not looking at this
appropriately

02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
we have a family when a person breaks up
 
02:45:56.990 --> 02:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
a family that is abuse on a child that
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
hurts a child and take it from someone
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
who's never had a
 
02:46:04.510 --> 02:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
father but the guy who was a father

and I grew up very
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
hurt the reason why I'm here is because
 
02:46:19.469 --> 02:46:19.479 align:start position:0%
I've gone to everybody else else if
 
02:46:21.349 --> 02:46:21.359 align:start position:0%

could fix it in days it's
 
02:46:47.790 --> 02:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
misappropriation of money I'm not angry
 
02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
at any of you I'm just being
 
02:46:52.269 --> 02:46:52.279 align:start position:0%
passionate about what's going on because
 
02:46:54.910 --> 02:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
these people are getting hundreds of
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars dcyf the family
 
02:46:59.790 --> 02:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
courts judges lawyers
 
02:47:02.710 --> 02:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
to pretend like they know what exactly
 
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
what is right or wrong I've gone to the
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
special committee for the family courts
 
02:47:10.710 --> 02:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
the house Speaker asked for more time
 
02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
been to the New Hampshire Coalition for
 
02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:14.070 align:start position:0%
been to the New Hampshire Coalition for
domestic

02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
violence I believe that they're the ones
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
who put this propaganda it says in this
 
02:47:22.429 --> 02:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
letter that I was
 
02:47:25.630 --> 02:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
ordered to have a mental evaluation or I
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
would have to have supervised visits and
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
I refused
 
02:47:32.190 --> 02:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
it that's not true I was never
 
02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
ordered mental evaluation I was
 
02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
never ordered supervisor the lawyer
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
didn't even opposing counsel didn't even
 
02:47:43.950 --> 02:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
ask for that so I'm being human
 
02:47:46.750 --> 02:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
trafficked and so are my children and
 
02:47:48.269 --> 02:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
I've reported it to the Manchester
 
02:47:51.870 --> 02:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
police they hung up on
 
02:47:54.070 --> 02:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
911 that's after the Attorney General
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
told me in writing if I feel my children
 
02:47:58.389 --> 02:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
are being abused I'm sorry not the
 
02:48:02.990 --> 02:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General uh YZ so Deputy that if
 
02:48:05.790 --> 02:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm being abused call
 
02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
911 so I eventually did after calling
 
02:48:10.269 --> 02:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
the Manchester police so you guys are
 
02:48:11.870 --> 02:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
talking about bringing these Chiefs of
 
02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
police here they're all in on it now not
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
to say that the police do what is
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
most of the stuff that they do is very
 
02:48:24.590 --> 02:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
good but there's an inherent bias and
 
02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
that bias is to protect women and
 
02:48:28.110 --> 02:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
children and
 
02:48:32.030 --> 02:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
women get all the protections under the
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
law unless and I've talked to a lot of
 
02:48:38.830 --> 02:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
families the Father the man is more
 
02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
politically connected so what we're
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
having is a system of Judges
 
02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:47.389 align:start position:0%
having is a system of Judges
lawyers

02:48:47.389 --> 02:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
administrators Department department
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
heads all appointed by the
 
02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
governor Supreme Court justice as well
 
02:48:58.030 --> 02:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
and Governor sununu is not a good
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
Governor I've been reaching out to him
 
02:49:02.550 --> 02:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
for over a year in
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
writing he has a lawyer Rudy who won't
 
02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
give me this I caught it on video and I
 
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
know what it says he won't give it
 
02:49:13.469 --> 02:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
they're just playing games they don't
 
02:49:15.269 --> 02:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
really want to help their children so
 
02:49:16.910 --> 02:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
when we get to the family courts and
 
02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at everything is decided
 
02:49:23.309 --> 02:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
by the courts everything anyone in here
 
02:49:27.070 --> 02:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
can be accused of anything or say that
 
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
someone's violating
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
me they can be the the police get to
 
02:49:36.030 --> 02:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
choose who to investigate who to
 
02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
prosecute the judges decide whatever
 
02:49:42.670 --> 02:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
they want and in my specific case they
 
02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
ordered and then reaffirm the order
 
02:49:47.550 --> 02:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
physically and mathematically impossible
 
02:49:50.349 --> 02:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
findings of fact physically and
 
02:49:52.750 --> 02:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
mathematically impossible findings of
 
02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
fact that's fraud they know about it
 
02:49:58.110 --> 02:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
based on the evidence that they received
 
02:50:00.229 --> 02:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
the lawyer knows about it the lawyer has
 
02:50:03.429 --> 02:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
a duty to report this to the judge the
 
02:50:06.030 --> 02:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
judge knows about it signed affidavits
 
02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
they hide it because the first thing the
 
02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
police do when you go to them is you say
 
02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
they they say do you have a lawyer this
 
02:50:15.469 --> 02:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
is the way it needs to
 
02:50:18.510 --> 02:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
go if a child is being abused you go to
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
the the police the police unlike in
 
02:50:24.309 --> 02:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
harmony Montgomery's case make an arrest
 
02:50:26.269 --> 02:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
if there's probable cause and that's
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
what we're all
 
02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
forgetting at the end of all this is the
 
02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:32.750 align:start position:0%
forgetting at the end of all this is the
Manchester

02:50:32.750 --> 02:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
02:50:36.229 --> 02:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
police and their inherent bias because
 
02:50:38.110 --> 02:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
they have a contract out which I will
 
02:50:39.710 --> 02:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
get to you guys I was trying to find
 
02:50:42.830 --> 02:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
that right now but I can't find it um
 
02:50:47.389 --> 02:50:47.399 align:start position:0%
but it was a contract signed to only
 
02:50:52.030 --> 02:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
train to train prosecutors judges police
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
only to protect women only and then the
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
grant was given to someone on the
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
domestic violence task force which
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
effectually is a pay raise of TW a 25%
 
02:51:04.030 --> 02:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
pay raise for
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
$55,000 I can say this because I have
 
02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
the contracts signed by Diane Martin on
 
02:51:11.950 --> 02:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
November 30th 2022 which was the same
 
02:51:14.269 --> 02:51:14.279 align:start position:0%
day that a fictitious domestic violence
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%

we can handle we need a jury trial in
 
02:51:33.670 --> 02:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
can have settle Family Matters in the
 
02:51:41.030 --> 02:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
family courts if the judges aren't lying
 
02:51:43.710 --> 02:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
the judges are lying because it's called
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
an expedited child support uh and I
 
02:51:48.229 --> 02:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
really appreciate uh there's a contract
 
02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
for it with the AOC so I really
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you what you guys are
 
02:51:57.469 --> 02:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
doing and I understand that it's a lot I
 
02:51:57.479 --> 02:51:58.469 align:start position:0%
doing and I understand that it's a lot I
call

02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
call
 
02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf 633 col 7 is human trafficking part
 
02:52:06.229 --> 02:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
three of it is abuse by abuse of the
 
02:52:09.150 --> 02:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
legal process I would say
 
02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
fraud I would say that uh ordering me to
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
violate a protection order and then
 
02:52:18.630 --> 02:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
holding me in contempt for not violating
 
02:52:21.229 --> 02:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
ating that protection order after I gave
 
02:52:24.030 --> 02:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
the judges and courts over and over
 
02:52:26.830 --> 02:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
here's 173b here's what you have to do
 
02:52:29.229 --> 02:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
which is the protection order we need to
 
02:52:32.670 --> 02:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
start repealing laws we need to start
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
which 173b is unconstitutional it's at
 
02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court right now I'm arguing
 
02:52:39.429 --> 02:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
that it's unconstitutional via Article
 
02:52:45.030 --> 02:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
15 article 14 is the protection of
 
02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
access to Justice no denial of Justice
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
no cost all our laws that you create and
 
02:52:56.630 --> 02:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we uphold are all based upon the
 
02:52:59.110 --> 02:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution and it all makes sense you
 
02:53:00.750 --> 02:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
can't kill anybody you can't attack
 
02:53:02.590 --> 02:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
anybody only in
 
02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:04.429 align:start position:0%
anybody only in
self-defense

02:53:04.429 --> 02:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
self-defense
 
02:53:07.389 --> 02:53:07.399 align:start position:0%
so the end there's two things that this
 
02:53:08.910 --> 02:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
committee can do if you can just wrap up
 
02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
with it it sounds like you are thank you
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
there's two things this committee can do
 
02:53:15.389 --> 02:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
it can record this testimony which it's
 
02:53:15.399 --> 02:53:16.229 align:start position:0%
it can record this testimony which it's
doing

02:53:16.229 --> 02:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
now and that be a message work with the
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
the individual agencies including the
 
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:28.910 --> 02:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
this and if they don't correct their
 
02:53:30.830 --> 02:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
behavior the legislature has a
 
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional power and
 
02:53:37.309 --> 02:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
duty to remove these
 
02:53:39.830 --> 02:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
justices and I think it's getting very
 
02:53:42.269 --> 02:53:42.279 align:start position:0%
close to the point where when judges are
 
02:53:45.469 --> 02:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
lying and writing fraud and then hiding
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
and abusing the legal process that
 
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's at this point I'd hope that
 
02:53:52.510 --> 02:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions I know I was
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
kind of a little all over the place but
 
02:53:55.830 --> 02:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate any questions if you
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
do have thank you very much for your
 
02:54:01.389 --> 02:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
testimony than you are there any
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions um no thank you thank you very
 
02:54:06.030 --> 02:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony um I hope that
 
02:54:07.190 --> 02:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
you saw that when we're going to be
 
02:54:08.830 --> 02:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
looking for this we want to make sure
 
02:54:10.710 --> 02:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
that things are handled appropriately
 
02:54:12.469 --> 02:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
moving between different groups so that
 
02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
if anything's been dropped in the
 
02:54:16.030 --> 02:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
process that um we can solve those
 
02:54:17.790 --> 02:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
problems okay so thank you um so then I
 
02:54:20.750 --> 02:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
I do want make it very fair note okay so
 
02:54:24.030 --> 02:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
this is a picture of criminal defamation
 
02:54:26.790 --> 02:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
at the governor's office this group and
 
02:54:29.030 --> 02:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
the legislators have a a duty and a
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
power to
 
02:54:35.910 --> 02:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
impeach the governor and then here's all
 
02:54:37.870 --> 02:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
the other things so I will be giving you
 
02:54:41.469 --> 02:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
the specific names such as judge previt
 
02:54:43.309 --> 02:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
um say if you want to give that to us in
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
writing I need to make I need to
 
02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what it is that
 
02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
you're asking and um testimony and I I
 
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
have absolutely no problem saying these
 
02:54:55.670 --> 02:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
names because I know 100% that the
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
record provides it thank you so much I
 
02:55:00.830 --> 02:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
you next we have Katrina
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
Hinrich you said three minutes is that
 
02:55:09.630 --> 02:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
three minutes solid
 
02:55:11.790 --> 02:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
or okay perfect I'll let you know when
 
02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's there so that uh then you can wrap
 
02:55:17.309 --> 02:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:17.319 --> 02:55:19.950 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:55:19.950 --> 02:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:42.389 align:start position:0%
you
don't

02:55:42.389 --> 02:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:48.630 --> 02:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
everybody um I was going to start off
 
02:55:51.269 --> 02:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
with something part of my DCF experience
 
02:55:53.389 --> 02:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to uh touch real quick and
 
02:55:56.469 --> 02:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
this might cause my three minute issue
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr tangway brought up a point and and
 
02:56:02.990 --> 02:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
it it has some Merit and I think it's
 
02:56:05.070 --> 02:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
something you guys should look
 
02:56:08.550 --> 02:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
into so when judges are writing orders
 
02:56:11.790 --> 02:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
because of or I should say Family Court
 
02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
judges there is an opinion that they're
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
writing now that's from our own Supreme
 
02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
Court they wrote an opinion of what a
 
02:56:22.630 --> 02:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
marital Master referee can
 
02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
do they can write an opinion it is not
 
02:56:27.469 --> 02:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
an enforcable
 
02:56:29.790 --> 02:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
order the
 
02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
state then put on the caveat that
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
a official judge in other words an
 
02:56:40.750 --> 02:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
officer of the state could sign off and
 
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
basically rubber stamp it the caveat is
 
02:56:46.349 --> 02:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
02:56:48.670 --> 02:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
to put too much time into into reading
 
02:56:50.590 --> 02:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
it because they they claim their lack of
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
resources and and I totally believe it
 
02:56:54.229 --> 02:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
time is a
 
02:56:58.429 --> 02:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
resource but once that gets signed or
 
02:57:02.309 --> 02:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
stamped that order now becomes real it's
 
02:57:03.790 --> 02:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
not real when it's written but then it
 
02:57:06.670 --> 02:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
becomes very real and at that point if
 
02:57:08.309 --> 02:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
there's falseness in it it becomes a
 
02:57:10.110 --> 02:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
lialis order which is something that I
 
02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
have personally experienced so that is
 
02:57:15.349 --> 02:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the way that
 
02:57:20.269 --> 02:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
works um with that said I will move on
 
02:57:23.469 --> 02:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
with the DCF piece and I'm going to give
 
02:57:25.269 --> 02:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
you a little
 
02:57:28.190 --> 02:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
clarification dcy have got involved in
 
02:57:30.510 --> 02:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
my case because there was an assault on
 
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
my oldest child by the other parent um
 
02:57:35.469 --> 02:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
something unfortunately I had to witness
 
02:57:37.110 --> 02:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
something she had to experience and then
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
I wound up experiencing also my forms of
 
02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
abuse off of
 
02:57:43.870 --> 02:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
it with that
 
02:57:46.910 --> 02:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
said dcyf did not get immediately
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
involved but we did get pushed there it
 
02:57:53.190 --> 02:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:56.030 --> 02:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism my biggest Focus as a mom at
 
02:57:57.510 --> 02:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
that point and you guys can understand
 
02:58:01.469 --> 02:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:04.830 --> 02:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
me was the health and well-being of my
 
02:58:07.710 --> 02:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
daughter I could care less about what
 
02:58:09.670 --> 02:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
the other person did I could care less
 
02:58:11.790 --> 02:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
about the arrest that just happened down
 
02:58:14.590 --> 02:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
the road as the person runs
 
02:58:17.550 --> 02:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
away um what I cared about was my
 
02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:18.990 align:start position:0%
away um what I cared about was my
daughter

02:58:18.990 --> 02:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
02:58:20.990 --> 02:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I knew at this point I'd already
 
02:58:22.229 --> 02:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
experienced enough to know that things
 
02:58:25.150 --> 02:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
were getting very bad my goal was to get
 
02:58:26.910 --> 02:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
out and I did speak to you guys last
 
02:58:30.269 --> 02:58:30.279 align:start position:0%
week about this I got divorced got out
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
immediately found myself pulled right
 
02:58:34.990 --> 02:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
back in on motions of we're going to
 
02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.790 align:start position:0%
back in on motions of we're going to
change

02:58:36.790 --> 02:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
things well okay make something do do
 
02:58:41.910 --> 02:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
something make make that little
 
02:58:43.309 --> 02:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment whatever you got to do let's
 
02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
move on 10 years in court is not just a
 
02:58:48.790 --> 02:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
little Amendment or a little change
 
02:58:50.910 --> 02:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
that is when I started digging into what
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
is the motivations behind some of
 
02:58:57.070 --> 02:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
this right back up into it another DCF
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
event happened DCF chose not to get
 
02:59:01.910 --> 02:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
involved but again it looked really
 
02:59:03.590 --> 02:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
really bad on the other person and this
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
was because the hospital a local
 
02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
hospital called the police two nights in
 
02:59:10.950 --> 02:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
a row for me to come and get my children
 
02:59:13.469 --> 02:59:13.479 align:start position:0%
one of them was trying to be admitted on
 
02:59:13.479 --> 02:59:14.790 align:start position:0%
one of them was trying to be admitted on
psychiatric

02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
psychiatric
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
evaluations but the police actually
 
02:59:20.750 --> 02:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
called was called by the hospital on the
 
02:59:23.269 --> 02:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
other parent it wasn't the
 
02:59:28.110 --> 02:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
child when I went in to get the children
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
the police officers told me look this is
 
02:59:30.910 --> 02:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
the second night in the row you really
 
02:59:34.190 --> 02:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
really need to come and get these kids
 
02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
and get a get a restraining order and
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
stuff I said I've tried that but I need
 
02:59:41.389 --> 02:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
reports be at the police station 9:00 I
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
get there I met at the window the
 
02:59:45.190 --> 02:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
administrator tells me chief police says
 
02:59:47.030 --> 02:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any
 
02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:48.670 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any
reports

02:59:48.670 --> 02:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
reports
 
02:59:51.870 --> 02:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
okay when we actually get the log the
 
02:59:56.110 --> 02:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
police log the police log was false it
 
02:59:59.429 --> 02:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
actually says two nights in a row Kyle
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
called juvenile delinquent it was never
 
03:00:04.429 --> 03:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
a call on the child it was a call on the
 
03:00:06.830 --> 03:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
other parents so that that's false it's
 
03:00:06.840 --> 03:00:08.229 align:start position:0%
other parents so that that's false it's
absolutely

03:00:08.229 --> 03:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
false with that said I got pushed right
 
03:00:13.229 --> 03:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
over into as you already know family
 
03:00:16.950 --> 03:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
court and what I started noticing was
 
03:00:18.910 --> 03:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
there had to be reason this was
 
03:00:18.920 --> 03:00:20.790 align:start position:0%
there had to be reason this was
happening

03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:00:23.830 --> 03:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
so having a financial back yep just up
 
03:00:25.389 --> 03:00:25.399 align:start position:0%
to that um I'll give you another two
 
03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
minutes to wrap it out yep I just got
 
03:00:29.910 --> 03:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
into the financial part of it I had to
 
03:00:31.830 --> 03:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
start looking at what was really truly
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
going on and that led me to title
 
03:00:39.070 --> 03:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
four and as far as I'm concerned all the
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
research I've done over the past like 10
 
03:00:44.830 --> 03:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
to 12 years title 4 is the Catalyst to
 
03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
what is running the family court we know
 
03:00:48.510 --> 03:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
gets large amounts of money from them we
 
03:00:54.269 --> 03:00:54.279 align:start position:0%
also know that if you read through title
 
03:00:55.870 --> 03:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
4 and I'll give you I'll give you the
 
03:00:58.510 --> 03:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
actual piece so you guys have it
 
03:01:00.750 --> 03:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
incentive payments to the states under
 
03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:02.309 align:start position:0%
incentive payments to the states under
Section

03:01:02.309 --> 03:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
Section
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
458 of us Code
 
03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:07.550 align:start position:0%
458 of us Code
42

03:01:07.550 --> 03:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
42
 
03:01:10.950 --> 03:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
658a that is incentive payments and this
 
03:01:14.590 --> 03:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:16.670 --> 03:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
four with that
 
03:01:19.309 --> 03:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
piece um there's also some consent
 
03:01:20.950 --> 03:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be addressed in
 
03:01:22.790 --> 03:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
title 4 that is not
 
03:01:25.630 --> 03:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
happening one of the pieces that is
 
03:01:29.229 --> 03:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
relevant is the Judiciary salary like a
 
03:01:32.510 --> 03:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
judge an officer of the state cannot be
 
03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
paid cannot be paid out of title for
 
03:01:37.550 --> 03:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
money but marital Masters and referees
 
03:01:40.710 --> 03:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
can which then bring you to how the
 
03:01:42.670 --> 03:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
state has set up the family court
 
03:01:45.510 --> 03:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
organization it is completely ran with
 
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
an we'll say an a loose oversight of the
 
03:01:50.510 --> 03:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
judicial branch by private
 
03:01:52.630 --> 03:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
contractors referees are private
 
03:01:54.950 --> 03:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
contractors marital Masters are private
 
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
contractors G's are private contractors
 
03:01:59.790 --> 03:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
therapists are private
 
03:02:02.110 --> 03:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
contractors attorneys technically
 
03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
private contractors the list goes on so
 
03:02:07.309 --> 03:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
the organization itself seems to be very
 
03:02:09.990 --> 03:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
structured as a business entity which
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
according to what I've read about the
 
03:02:13.950 --> 03:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
way the state structured it that's
 
03:02:15.870 --> 03:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what they intended to do it is
 
03:02:18.910 --> 03:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
privately ran and I'm Unsure how we get
 
03:02:22.030 --> 03:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
due process rights when it's ran by
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
private citizens and there's no no
 
03:02:27.229 --> 03:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
oversight so that's kind of where I'm
 
03:02:29.710 --> 03:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
I'm at with the title four it's it
 
03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:36.150 --> 03:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
money thank you very much um and thank
 
03:02:39.389 --> 03:02:39.399 align:start position:0%
you for that tie into the due process um
 
03:02:42.070 --> 03:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
is there any questions from anybody
 
03:02:43.349 --> 03:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I appreciate you
 
03:02:46.830 --> 03:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
us

03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:02:52.910 --> 03:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
see so now I have three other cards um
 
03:02:54.710 --> 03:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
one's for seven minutes one's for 10
 
03:02:58.269 --> 03:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
minutes one's for 30 to 40 minutes um I
 
03:03:02.349 --> 03:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
Mr noon um would you mind limiting it to
 
03:03:04.349 --> 03:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
10 minutes or otherwise I'm going to put
 
03:03:06.150 --> 03:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
you at the end of the stack just to
 
03:03:09.630 --> 03:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
time

03:03:12.070 --> 03:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay there there will be more in the
 
03:03:16.750 --> 03:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
future so if you can limit it to one
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
topic so that we don't get overwhelmed
 
03:03:21.870 --> 03:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
and talk to us just about one part of
 
03:03:24.950 --> 03:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
that that would help us a
 
03:03:29.389 --> 03:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
lot we'll we'll do thank you um Don
 
03:03:29.399 --> 03:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
lot we'll we'll do thank you um Don

minutes good morning thank you madam
 
03:03:40.110 --> 03:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
chair uh many of you in this room know
 
03:03:43.030 --> 03:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
who I am what most of my testimonies are
 
03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
about many of you have received emails
 
03:03:49.030 --> 03:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
in depth about many of these t four
 
03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:51.030 align:start position:0%
in depth about many of these t four
issues

03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:03:54.990 --> 03:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
um it's really something that we need to
 
03:03:57.070 --> 03:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
take more serious and there's a reason
 
03:03:58.309 --> 03:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
why we're all here
 
03:04:02.229 --> 03:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
today um it's not just a
 
03:04:04.389 --> 03:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
misappropriation of funds but it is a
 
03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
gross neglect on behalf of our state uh
 
03:04:09.550 --> 03:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
and the federal government is cracking
 
03:04:12.750 --> 03:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
down uh it is not a question of if it is
 
03:04:17.309 --> 03:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
a question of when uh child support is a
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
big aspect of that um that ties into all
 
03:04:23.150 --> 03:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
of this that some of these members have
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
received emails
 
03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
on uh while everybody's focusing on more
 
03:04:30.830 --> 03:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
on the due process side of the parents I
 
03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
take a different approach and do focus
 
03:04:34.950 --> 03:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
on the due process side of the children
 
03:04:39.469 --> 03:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
as well and while a lot of people will
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
disagree or agree with my positionings
 
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
on it I do feel that if we were
 
03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
following the protocols the polic IES
 
03:04:50.790 --> 03:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the laws on the books today we would
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
not be abusing the due process of the
 
03:04:55.910 --> 03:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
parents children and all parties
 
03:04:58.469 --> 03:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
involved that being said that is not
 
03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
occurring um it's just outright not um
 
03:05:05.710 --> 03:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
speaking to a point that representative
 
03:05:08.429 --> 03:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
Weber said uh said
 
03:05:11.750 --> 03:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
that um all of these DCF cases start in
 
03:05:14.469 --> 03:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
court that is absolutely unfactual uh
 
03:05:17.269 --> 03:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
these cases do not start in court um
 
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
mostly the time they are being closed
 
03:05:23.110 --> 03:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
out as founded problem resolved so that
 
03:05:25.229 --> 03:05:25.239 align:start position:0%
they can procure criminal charges
 
03:05:28.469 --> 03:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
because if you look at the Statue of 169
 
03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
C and the criminal prosecution of any of
 
03:05:36.990 --> 03:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
these entities or issues you cannot
 
03:05:40.269 --> 03:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
criminally charge somebody there's a
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
under 169c uh 12a I believe there is use
 
03:05:48.229 --> 03:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
immunity for any person that's involved
 
03:05:48.239 --> 03:05:49.070 align:start position:0%
immunity for any person that's involved
with

03:05:49.070 --> 03:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:05:52.590 --> 03:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
dcyf for criminal conviction you are not
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to charge anybody for a criminal
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
crime that is involved with DCF in a
 
03:05:58.000 --> 03:05:58.950 align:start position:0%
crime that is involved with DCF in a
court

03:05:58.950 --> 03:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:06:05.070 --> 03:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
case that is upheld by Melissa M uh 127
 
03:06:08.910 --> 03:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
710 in New Hampshire Supreme Court from
 
03:06:12.790 --> 03:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
1986 where they ruled that use immunity
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh for individuals involved with dcyf
 
03:06:18.950 --> 03:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
are immune from Criminal liability
 
03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
um could you give us that citation again
 
03:06:24.910 --> 03:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
please I can Melissa M 7 uh
 
03:06:30.030 --> 03:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
710 yep not a problem so again these are
 
03:06:36.229 --> 03:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
some of these issues that are going on
 
03:06:39.229 --> 03:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
is where you have that use immunity
 
03:06:43.630 --> 03:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
involved but then you have DCF Casa and
 
03:06:45.670 --> 03:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately even a child's attorney at
 
03:06:47.710 --> 03:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
this current time trying to procure
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
criminal charges for a parent that's
 
03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
involved with
 
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
dcyf um I'm not going to get into too
 
03:06:57.190 --> 03:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
much specifics but this case has been
 
03:07:00.830 --> 03:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
going on for four years now and some of
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
these members have heard recently that
 
03:07:04.830 --> 03:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
the child has been asking to appear in
 
03:07:07.710 --> 03:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
court for three years now with dcyf and
 
03:07:10.349 --> 03:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
Casa refusing the child to
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
appear and that that's a due process
 
03:07:15.830 --> 03:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
violation of the child's rights the
 
03:07:17.630 --> 03:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
child has every right the child is now
 
03:07:24.630 --> 03:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.710 --> 03:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
second and we have every party denying
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
this child from having the voice that
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
they deserve and I understand that I'm
 
03:07:39.630 --> 03:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
you know potentially the accused party
 
03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not the only party of this case
 
03:07:44.309 --> 03:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's multiple parties uh there's 10
 
03:07:46.910 --> 03:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
children involved uh only one of them is
 
03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
my mom my own um which you can see the
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
gravity of the situation based on
 
03:07:56.510 --> 03:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:07:56.520 --> 03:07:58.790 align:start position:0%
that um
sorry

03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah so we have this situation where
 
03:08:05.590 --> 03:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're denying these children's rights to
 
03:08:08.190 --> 03:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
their voice in their day in court when
 
03:08:08.200 --> 03:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
their voice in their day in court when
they're

03:08:08.950 --> 03:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:08:11.309 --> 03:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
requesting their day in court and I
 
03:08:13.910 --> 03:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
understand obviously yes it it's hard it
 
03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
nobody's saying that it's easy to have
 
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
that child come into court and here
 
03:08:20.429 --> 03:08:20.439 align:start position:0%
what's being said the gruesome acts that
 
03:08:23.550 --> 03:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
are going on to multiple children not
 
03:08:26.550 --> 03:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
biologic to myself that are biologic to
 
03:08:26.560 --> 03:08:27.309 align:start position:0%
biologic to myself that are biologic to
the

03:08:27.309 --> 03:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:31.790 --> 03:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
child but it's something that had we
 
03:08:33.150 --> 03:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
have followed the policies and
 
03:08:35.309 --> 03:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
procedures from day one none of this
 
03:08:37.550 --> 03:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
would have happened we're sitting on an
 
03:08:39.309 --> 03:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
issue where the Attorney General stepped
 
03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
in in November uh and indeed uh alleged
 
03:08:46.510 --> 03:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
that well confirmed the allegations
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
presented by multiple parties that DCF
 
03:08:51.670 --> 03:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
was perjuring themselves with regards to
 
03:08:55.510 --> 03:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
Fitness and uh some other
 
03:08:59.630 --> 03:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
issues um against DCF uh DCF has not
 
03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
been factual in nature the entirety of
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
the case load and it has presented
 
03:09:06.630 --> 03:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
serious harm to multiple
 
03:09:10.229 --> 03:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
children uh with an episode of in last
 
03:09:12.550 --> 03:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
year which I testified before the family
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
and child law committee about this
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
earlier this year that there was an
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
episode last summer where some of these
 
03:09:23.389 --> 03:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
children were exposed to adult sexual
 
03:09:25.190 --> 03:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
activity with the child present in the
 
03:09:28.750 --> 03:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
bed and DCF still left that child inside
 
03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:32.750 align:start position:0%
bed and DCF still left that child inside
that

03:09:32.750 --> 03:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:36.750 --> 03:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
home so these are some of the arous
 
03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:37.950 align:start position:0%
home so these are some of the arous
issues

03:09:37.950 --> 03:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:09:42.429 --> 03:09:42.439 align:start position:0%
and these are not exclusive to my family
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
um these are not exclusive to any one
 
03:09:47.389 --> 03:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
family we I have I can't give that
 
03:09:50.190 --> 03:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
information obviously because I'm not at
 
03:09:52.710 --> 03:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
Liberty to go ahead and you know inflict
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
potential retaliation against other
 
03:09:57.870 --> 03:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
families but we have multiple families
 
03:10:00.830 --> 03:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
that are presenting uh similar to the
 
03:10:04.830 --> 03:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
Dennis Von Jr case where parents are
 
03:10:08.910 --> 03:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
making these reports of concerns against
 
03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
these workers not following laws and
 
03:10:15.389 --> 03:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
procedures and it's turning out to be
 
03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
detrimental to these children
 
03:10:20.590 --> 03:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's where I'll leave that for
 
03:10:24.110 --> 03:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
today um as many of you know that I'll
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
be back around sooner
 
03:10:28.710 --> 03:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
enough thank you and I'm sorry that
 
03:10:31.710 --> 03:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
you've been through this process
 
03:10:34.830 --> 03:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if there's any questions
 
03:10:37.269 --> 03:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
um but thank you and you actually were
 
03:10:39.910 --> 03:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
exactly seven minutes I paused it for 30
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
seconds while you while I was giving you
 
03:10:42.990 --> 03:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
time to compose yourself I don't think
 
03:10:45.229 --> 03:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
anybody can do that yeah but thank you
 
03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
and um hopefully we can find those
 
03:10:50.030 --> 03:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
any gaps in policies and procedures
 
03:10:52.150 --> 03:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
because um we need to have standards so
 
03:10:53.950 --> 03:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
that things can be done correctly so
 
03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam
 
03:10:58.030 --> 03:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
chair um next I'd like to call Shelby
 
03:11:00.910 --> 03:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
Boyce um you'd said 10 minutes at least
 
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
um so you've probably missed it when we
 
03:11:05.150 --> 03:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
first were introducing this um we just
 
03:11:06.790 --> 03:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that what we have is
 
03:11:10.590 --> 03:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
something that we can that we can manage
 
03:11:12.429 --> 03:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
with what you have if there's if it gets
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
to go too long it's harder for us to get
 
03:11:16.630 --> 03:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
the value of everything you're saying
 
03:11:18.429 --> 03:11:18.439 align:start position:0%
and we might lose something important
 
03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
that you've shared with us um so I'm
 
03:11:22.830 --> 03:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
going to set the timer for 10 minutes
 
03:11:24.510 --> 03:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
I'll let you just wrap up at that point
 
03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
but if you can try and keep just to the
 
03:11:28.110 --> 03:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
details that we need and not share
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
anything that's too personal that you
 
03:11:30.990 --> 03:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to have on this recorded
 
03:11:34.110 --> 03:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
testimony with um YouTube so with that
 
03:11:37.229 --> 03:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um for letting me
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
speak I haven't really had a voice for
 
03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
um the past like five years um I've been
 
03:11:47.309 --> 03:11:47.319 align:start position:0%
dealing with DCF and actually a lot of
 
03:11:48.510 --> 03:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
people and I don't really know how to
 
03:11:49.830 --> 03:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
sum this up and I'm kind of just
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
swinging it um I have four disabled
 
03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:56.670 align:start position:0%
swinging it um I have four disabled
children

03:11:56.670 --> 03:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:12:00.229 --> 03:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
and a um felon was pushed into my life
 
03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
where I started a relationship and we
 
03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
moved to lonia and when we got there
 
03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
abuse started happening pretty bad and
 
03:12:12.030 --> 03:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just abuse from the partner
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
that I was with it was the cops the
 
03:12:17.469 --> 03:12:17.479 align:start position:0%
school abusing my son locking him in the
 
03:12:21.389 --> 03:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
Huts he's nonverbal like a lot of
 
03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
traumatic things started
 
03:12:26.110 --> 03:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
happening my daughter you know got
 
03:12:29.670 --> 03:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
abused by his son and they didn't have
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
enough information
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
apparently and you know off that goes
 
03:12:37.870 --> 03:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
they accused my ex-husband of touching
 
03:12:40.190 --> 03:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
my children and then tried to put my
 
03:12:42.750 --> 03:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
kids with him in fact they did for a
 
03:12:44.790 --> 03:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
brief moment there's a there's too much
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
in my case that I don't know how to
 
03:12:48.269 --> 03:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
focus on one thing because nobody's
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
listened it's absolutely disgusting that
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
you you accuse a man of touching his
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
children then you never investigate him
 
03:12:58.710 --> 03:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
he flees to Texas then he comes back and
 
03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
now you're trying to reunify my children
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
with him
 
03:13:06.150 --> 03:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
because I'm in an abusive relationship
 
03:13:07.269 --> 03:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
over one
 
03:13:09.750 --> 03:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
report there's a lot of proof in this
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
case and everything that I had they
 
03:13:17.349 --> 03:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
literally just took it away they made me
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
lose my apartment by taking my partner
 
03:13:21.269 --> 03:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
and giving him a 30-day stepback over
 
03:13:23.750 --> 03:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
one incident that they didn't have
 
03:13:26.429 --> 03:13:26.439 align:start position:0%
really any proof of they didn't give him
 
03:13:27.830 --> 03:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
a chance to do anything they just came
 
03:13:30.030 --> 03:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
in with no contacts on everything the
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
dcyf worker came and brought me boxes
 
03:13:35.349 --> 03:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
every day in court that we were there I
 
03:13:37.309 --> 03:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
would cry my eyes out and I'm like you
 
03:13:38.670 --> 03:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
take my partner away and I'm going to be
 
03:13:40.389 --> 03:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
homeless I can't get my kids back if I'm
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
homeless I'm just a a single mom
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
basically of four disabled children
 
03:13:47.870 --> 03:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
living off of $1,500 a month they gave
 
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
him I know I'm kind of all over the
 
03:13:52.190 --> 03:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
place cuz it's hard it's hard for me
 
03:13:54.150 --> 03:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
I've been through some serious trauma in
 
03:13:56.110 --> 03:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
the situation between all of these
 
03:13:58.910 --> 03:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
people I've been sex trafficked I have
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
dealt with horrendous things since
 
03:14:04.590 --> 03:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
losing my apartment and I don't know how
 
03:14:07.349 --> 03:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
to how to say it to anybody but nobody
 
03:14:10.510 --> 03:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
has listened this whole time um DCF just
 
03:14:11.710 --> 03:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
makes false
 
03:14:14.190 --> 03:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
reports it's absolutely disgusting they
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
hide the facts you know the day I moved
 
03:14:18.510 --> 03:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
in there was there was
 
03:14:21.070 --> 03:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
um them telling me that I couldn't let
 
03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
my ex-husband around the kids but and to
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
change the order at the court and you
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
know I did what they told me to do and I
 
03:14:32.429 --> 03:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
I can't even think right now I'm like
 
03:14:35.309 --> 03:14:35.319 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry is it the sorry if you
 
03:14:38.190 --> 03:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
take a breath I can't I didn't this is
 
03:14:40.710 --> 03:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
kind of like a last minute thing and I
 
03:14:42.150 --> 03:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not good at speaking and I don't
 
03:14:43.590 --> 03:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
know what I'm supposed to say and not
 
03:14:48.150 --> 03:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
say and Pa just one second it seems to
 
03:14:50.550 --> 03:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
me that it's a lack of it's a lack of
 
03:14:52.309 --> 03:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
consistency would you say that it's a
 
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
lack of consistency from them lack of
 
03:14:56.670 --> 03:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
consistency they literally build up
 
03:14:58.910 --> 03:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
cases that just don't make any sense and
 
03:15:00.670 --> 03:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
there's so much chaos and you they give
 
03:15:03.429 --> 03:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
you a partial discovery of you know a
 
03:15:06.150 --> 03:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
banker's box and it's all scattered it's
 
03:15:08.710 --> 03:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
not even in order it things are missing
 
03:15:10.469 --> 03:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
they don't take any evidence from you
 
03:15:12.510 --> 03:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
you know you have everything and they
 
03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
just hide it all it it's too many people
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
involved and too much abuse going on and

through a really really difficult
 
03:15:58.269 --> 03:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
situation not enough time to sit there
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
and explain everything that's happened
 
03:16:01.830 --> 03:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
in years is it all right if we just ask
 
03:16:03.389 --> 03:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
you a couple of these questions or so
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
that this this can be focused a little
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
to help you out we're trying to help you
 
03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
by asking you I understand okay
 
03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you had a question
 
03:16:13.389 --> 03:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
I just had a clarifying question so I
 
03:16:15.309 --> 03:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
would understand what you said already
 
03:16:17.349 --> 03:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
and if this is inappropriate or tough
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
for you you it's fine not to answer um
 
03:16:24.870 --> 03:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
at one point you used the word partner
 
03:16:27.070 --> 03:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
and at one point I you used the word
 
03:16:30.469 --> 03:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
husband am I thinking that the husband
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
is an ex-husband and the partner is your
 
03:16:35.150 --> 03:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
current partner I have an ex-husband if
 
03:16:37.389 --> 03:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
that's difficult I have an ex-husband
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
and then I had divorced him he was
 
03:16:43.630 --> 03:16:43.640 align:start position:0%
abusive and and this guy from conquered
 
03:16:45.670 --> 03:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
prison was pushed on
 
03:16:48.510 --> 03:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
me um
 
03:16:50.309 --> 03:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
so different people and I'm not with
 
03:16:53.309 --> 03:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
this person it's been two years now okay
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
um that person introduced me to
 
03:16:58.429 --> 03:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
drugs I was being
 
03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
drugged I was being psychologically just
 
03:17:06.349 --> 03:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
tormented by
 
03:17:09.630 --> 03:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
him by by everybody in
 
03:17:12.070 --> 03:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
lonia and I just being messed with the
 
03:17:12.080 --> 03:17:14.189 align:start position:0%
lonia and I just being messed with the
whole

03:17:14.189 --> 03:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
whole
 
03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
time and I'm so sorry and I don't I
 
03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
don't want you to go deeper into
 
03:17:22.349 --> 03:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
anything you don't want to go into I
 
03:17:24.110 --> 03:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
just I don't mind going into anything
 
03:17:25.830 --> 03:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just afraid I don't know what I'm
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to say or not say because I've
 
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
been told that I need to basically be
 
03:17:33.150 --> 03:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
quiet I've been threatened my life has
 
03:17:37.309 --> 03:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
been threatened severely this whole time
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then they didn't understand why I
 
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't leave my
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
partner and and get help and they
 
03:17:48.070 --> 03:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
weren't helping me and and I was scared
 
03:17:51.030 --> 03:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I was literally being
 
03:17:53.550 --> 03:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
drugged I would wake up with nle marks
 
03:17:55.830 --> 03:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
in my arms and petrify the needles I
 
03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
don't do that nobody listens so if I can
 
03:18:02.469 --> 03:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
just interrupt you now you have shared
 
03:18:05.389 --> 03:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
so much with us and I'm so sorry with
 
03:18:06.990 --> 03:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
everything you've gone through how do
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
you come at somebody they came at me
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
because of my spiritual beliefs because
 
03:18:12.790 --> 03:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
I had a near death experience that was
 
03:18:15.990 --> 03:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
really really traumatic and they made me
 
03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
they forced me to go and have a
 
03:18:20.990 --> 03:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
emergency mental health evaluation
 
03:18:23.150 --> 03:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
without a warrant would not leave my
 
03:18:25.389 --> 03:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
house that if I didn't go do it wave my
 
03:18:27.790 --> 03:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hippa and tell them everything about
 
03:18:30.910 --> 03:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
this spiritual awakening that was mocked
 
03:18:31.990 --> 03:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
that they were going to take my kids
 
03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:33.189 align:start position:0%
that they were going to take my kids
from

03:18:33.189 --> 03:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:18:35.590 --> 03:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
school they've done so many things
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:42.189 --> 03:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
funny I you're so brave for coming and
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
sharing this with us I if if I can I'm
 
03:18:48.150 --> 03:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
just going to ask probably makes sense
 
03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
to end what you're saying now but I'd
 
03:18:52.870 --> 03:18:52.880 align:start position:0%

feel what we go through I don't believe
 
03:19:07.309 --> 03:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
that for a second you cannot feel
 
03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else's pain unless you have
 
03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%

03:19:14.189 --> 03:19:14.199 align:start position:0%

hi I'm Melissa I'm from the
 
03:28:21.710 --> 03:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
state I said Melissa I reject your offer
 
03:28:25.189 --> 03:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
to contract with me and then I promptly
 
03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
sent a cease and assist order with a fee
 
03:28:32.990 --> 03:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
schedule to the director of uh DCF at
 
03:28:36.349 --> 03:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
that time Joseph RIS bomb and in that
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
ceas and
 
03:28:41.110 --> 03:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
assist I put all of the reasons or not
 
03:28:43.550 --> 03:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
all but some of the reasons why I did
 
03:28:47.229 --> 03:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
not why I rejected DC F's offer to
 
03:28:49.990 --> 03:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
contract with me these guys are offering
 
03:28:52.510 --> 03:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
to contract with people and they're
 
03:28:55.950 --> 03:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
using quite literally uh threats of
 
03:28:57.510 --> 03:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
violence threats of getting the police
 
03:28:59.710 --> 03:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
and courts involved they're calling
 
03:29:02.030 --> 03:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
Family Court a court it's not a court
 
03:29:03.710 --> 03:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's a legislative tribunal wasn't
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
created by the Judiciary it doesn't
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
exercise due process of law so they're
 
03:29:10.429 --> 03:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
using all of these elements and weapons
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
quite regularly
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
to uh sort of threatening Cor people
 
03:29:19.189 --> 03:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
into Contracting with them by accepting
 
03:29:22.269 --> 03:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
their services by accepting their offers
 
03:29:23.670 --> 03:29:23.680 align:start position:0%

03:29:26.670 --> 03:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
happening because well let's be you know
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%

that was submitted to this
 
03:30:45.389 --> 03:30:45.399 align:start position:0%

uh affidavits under oath of penalty and
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
perjury and put lies right into him oh
 
03:30:56.590 --> 03:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
another thing is I did a write to no
 
03:30:58.750 --> 03:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
request for the oath of office of the
 
03:31:01.750 --> 03:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
director of DCF for the oath of office
 
03:31:04.710 --> 03:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
of Melissa kums a social worker I got a
 
03:31:07.110 --> 03:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
letter back that said I'll find it here
 
03:31:09.790 --> 03:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
in a second that they don't have any
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
oath of office there is no oath to the
 
03:31:14.710 --> 03:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution how are these people even
 
03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to understand what processes if
 
03:31:19.950 --> 03:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
they have no oath of office the police
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
officers have an oath of office the
 
03:31:23.710 --> 03:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
Haner PD I asked them for their oath
 
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
oath of office for all their officers
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
and they give it to me it's there it
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
exists I get a denial I also asked them
 
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
about their bonding information all
 
03:31:34.670 --> 03:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
government agents all governmental
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
agents all Municipal corporate employees
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
DCF actually is probably not even part
 
03:31:41.110 --> 03:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
of the government best best I can tell
 
03:31:43.389 --> 03:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
it's a mere Municipal Corporation it's
 
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
all it is and you guys or the
 
03:31:48.750 --> 03:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislature funds it the legislature
 
03:31:49.710 --> 03:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
03:31:52.030 --> 03:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
exist because you guys fund it because
 
03:31:53.590 --> 03:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
it exists by the legislature and I don't
 
03:31:55.150 --> 03:31:55.160 align:start position:0%
mean just you individuals in this room
 
03:31:57.550 --> 03:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
but the legislature in general you have
 
03:31:59.429 --> 03:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
the ability to look at every single
 
03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
document all of the funding uh all these
 
03:32:03.710 --> 03:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
sealed cases should be able to be
 
03:32:05.710 --> 03:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
unsealed and looked into by the
 
03:32:08.110 --> 03:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
legislature maybe there you guys haven't
 
03:32:09.710 --> 03:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
figured out how to do that but if you
 
03:32:12.750 --> 03:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
control them and you allow them exist
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
you the legislature gave them life the
 
03:32:17.630 --> 03:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
legislature can take all away from dcyf
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
I believe and that should be happening
 
03:32:22.990 --> 03:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
so in an affidavit which is from this
 
03:32:24.910 --> 03:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
motion to enter which is what the social
 
03:32:26.469 --> 03:32:26.479 align:start position:0%

stated they are familiar with the family
 
03:32:49.070 --> 03:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
due to the residents being free Staters
 
03:32:51.070 --> 03:32:51.080 align:start position:0%

about my family property community and
 
03:33:33.590 --> 03:33:33.600 align:start position:0%

03:33:35.429 --> 03:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
amongst the family court and local law

03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
trespass of my property and has also
 
03:33:47.229 --> 03:33:47.239 align:start position:0%

I have young children right now that are
 
03:33:50.349 --> 03:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
two and four years old and if you're
 
03:33:52.469 --> 03:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
parents you understand at the most
 
03:33:54.269 --> 03:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
valuable time in your child's life is
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
within that first six-year window to
 
03:33:59.070 --> 03:33:59.080 align:start position:0%

03:34:02.229 --> 03:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of time you can with them
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%

he filed so we're at the 10 if you want
 
03:37:33.189 --> 03:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
to wrap up for us DCF after being told
 
03:37:35.229 --> 03:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
that there's no abuse or neglect after
 
03:37:37.630 --> 03:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
being told that the the hener police
 
03:37:39.309 --> 03:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
could do the assessment order rejected
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
all of that they said that the police
 
03:37:42.429 --> 03:37:42.439 align:start position:0%
were incompetent they weren't able to do
 
03:37:44.750 --> 03:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
this and then they escalated and they
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
went forth and Ross McLoud submitted a
 
03:37:52.870 --> 03:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
motion to v a motion to um a contempt
 
03:37:54.710 --> 03:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
motion against my wife and I in Family
 
03:37:58.429 --> 03:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
Court I have here a verified expedited
 
03:38:00.150 --> 03:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
motion to correct a record and change
 
03:38:02.830 --> 03:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
the core order based on prior material
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
me misrepresentation that you guys
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
should absolutely read these are the
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
words of the hener chief of police uh
 
03:38:11.910 --> 03:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
that motion was
 
03:38:14.030 --> 03:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
vacated and here's the thing with the
 
03:38:17.590 --> 03:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
assessment order it is orders the police
 
03:38:19.189 --> 03:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
or a social worker to do something it
 
03:38:20.910 --> 03:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't order a parent to do anything
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
Ross McLoud is very aware of this Jr
 
03:38:26.429 --> 03:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
Hall a representative in this house made
 
03:38:29.070 --> 03:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
Ross McLoud very aware of this with his
 
03:38:32.990 --> 03:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
attorney in filings a year before um
 
03:38:35.710 --> 03:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
they did this with me and so Ross McLoud
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
is just submitting garbage essentially
 
03:38:41.630 --> 03:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
maladministration and fraud to these
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
family courts by submitting uh contempt
 
03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
motion when the contempor is not even
 
03:38:48.990 --> 03:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
named in an
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
order and we had hener police on board
 
03:38:54.910 --> 03:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
to do this and the reason
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
dcyf as far as I'm concerned and best I
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
can tell did not want hener police doing
 
03:39:03.550 --> 03:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
the assessment is because DCF gets paid
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
out of this title 4 program to do these
 
03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
assessments each time they do an
 
03:39:09.590 --> 03:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
assessment I heard the number is like
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
$6,000 to do an assessment you guys
 
03:39:14.790 --> 03:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
should really look into this program to
 
03:39:17.469 --> 03:39:17.479 align:start position:0%
uh maximize res revenue for DCF to
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
understand what the social workers are
 
03:39:21.389 --> 03:39:21.399 align:start position:0%
being taught on how to maximize Revenue
 
03:39:23.710 --> 03:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
this is a textbook definition of child
 
03:39:25.830 --> 03:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
trafficking trafficking means buying
 
03:39:28.389 --> 03:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
selling or trading transporting for
 
03:39:30.670 --> 03:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
higher and we all know what children are
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
they're these little babies that we love
 
03:39:34.550 --> 03:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
and there's demonic forces out there
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
that want to harvest their energy it's
 
03:39:37.950 --> 03:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
been the tale that's been going on for
 
03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
thousands of years books and movies are
 
03:39:43.710 --> 03:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
written about this so I'll be back I'm
 
03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%

do nothing evil will
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
