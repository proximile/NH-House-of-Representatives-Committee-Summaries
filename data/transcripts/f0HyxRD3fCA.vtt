Mr chair thanks for taking my question
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
just simple question is this new funding

or is this just restoring old funding
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
this is this is making sure that the
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
funding that has been in place for these
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
programs stays in place thank
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%

we'll know that that does not include
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question so am I
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
right in assuming that uh adrd is
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
increasing in New Hampshire and could
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
you put some numbers uh uh on
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
increase and uh second question uh is it
 
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
relate to to this
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
programs like what percentage of uh
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
adrd uh patients are treated by these
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
programs and uh is is there any
 
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.269 align:start position:0%

uh where where where patients who are
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
not treed in this programs uh where they
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
could go thank
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
you um I believe the first question was
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
related to the adrcs and the operation
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
disorder adrd with aging population and
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%

are increasing in New Hampshire and can
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%

00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
into increased numbers in the coming
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
years yes and I believe that there will
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
be testimony coming forward from people
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
who are um experiencing and um are able
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
to access the Grant and how it helps
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
them but overall we serve a little over
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
um 250 individuals with our current
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%

our family caregiver program um

currently we are uh
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh having a brain health campaign um
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
that's both going to Medical providers
 
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
and the general public um really to um
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
get education and Outreach and an
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
understanding of Alzheimer's disease and
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
related dementia and early screening um
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
so we expect um as a result of that
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
campaign and based on the trends that we
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
have for the people that were serving
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
that we will um need to have more
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
capacity um to serve individuals and
 
00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:48.430 align:start position:0%
capacity um to serve individuals and

representative
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
being here today so this $900,000 that I
 
00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:02.759 align:start position:0%
see in the fiscal note is that are
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
those caregiver or DHS DHHS salaries or
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
are they just funds of overseeing the
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
program and the way we operate our
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
family caregiver program um within the
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
bureau is that the uh majority um the
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the Alzheimer's disease
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
and related dementia uh funding that is
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the budget that you see
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
here um it goes directly to respit
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
Grants so uh the way we operate the
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
program is that we leverage our older
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
American Zach Services um and the
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
matching General funds that are required
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
for our older American Zach caregiver
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
program to operate the contractors that
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
provide caregiver support and counseling
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
and our Financial Management Services
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
contractor that and administers the
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
grants directly to the to the caregivers
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
followup yes just quick followup so this
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't include like let's say for
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
example a caregiver's salary that's not
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
included in
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
this the the respit grant would pay for
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
um an individual to provide Direct Care
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
so when we work with a family caregiver
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
who needs respit they will um often
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
times need help finding a direct
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
caregiver or they may have somebody in
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
mind and we use our contractor to be the
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
employer of record and pay for the
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
direct care for the rest
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
bit thank you other questions
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
representative Woods um thank you Mr
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
um what is the cycle uh this is U sort
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
of peeling in on funds you've had before
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
is that something that comes up
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
periodically is it going be every
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
bium yes we do have an accounting unit
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
and appropriation currently for both um
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
the Alzheimer's disease and related
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
dementia General funds as well as
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
support for volunteerism and that would
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
come up every budget year okay follow
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
follow up um now is this budget you've
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
sort of alluded to other programs is
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
that sufficient to expand it both in
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
terms of what's been referenced an aging
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
population well the need is bigger and
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
we know that people that stay at home
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
generally do better and less cost uh so
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
expanding it both in terms of just the
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
numbers but also the types of programs
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
is this budget sufficient to accomplish
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
both of those um it certainly uh the
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's um proposed in this
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill certainly builds the capacity to
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
serve additional individuals um with the
 
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
resic grant we could probably serve um a
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
few hundred more um respit grants
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
depending on the uh the volume and the
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
Outreach and the results of our uh brain
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
health campaign and the Outreach and
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
education that um we do um through the
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
bureau thank you representative
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
Weber and just so I'm sure that we're
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
all on the same page am I correct in
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
thinking that the vast majority of care
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
is provided usually by family members at
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
no cost to the public and at enormous
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
cost to the family
 
00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:41.559 align:start position:0%
caregivers and what we are trying to do
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
here is give somebody who spends
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
247 with a beloved family member who may
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
be very difficult to live
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
with a small amount of time where they
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
can breathe and be themselves and know
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
that their loved one is
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
safe yes I would agree with that we um
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
and we see that and there's many people
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
here that can speak to their experience
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
and um the difference that it's made um
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
in their lives as a family caregiver um
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
and and that's really the vision and the
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
goal for providing these supports is to
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
ensure people can um stay at home in the
 
00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
community where they want to be and that
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
the people who are getting really that
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
uncompensated uh service um and care
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
that's being provided um some some
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
relief um and support um so that they
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
can continue doing
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
that other question representative
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
cofal thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so uh would it be
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
accurate to say that um this program is
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
potentially preventing some patients
 
00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799 align:start position:0%
from being shifted to a a much higher
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
cost um um you know in home nursing care
 
00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
or you know full-time Care
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
Facility um yes I would think that
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's fair to say um in terms of the
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
the caregivers who we see um benefiting
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
um from the program and from the respit
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
um and the counseling and education that
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
we're able to provide through the
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
through the bureau that um definitely is
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
a outcome that we're
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
seeing representative Markel thank you
 
00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:29.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um ma'am can you
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
tell us um about how many people do you
 
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039 align:start position:0%
expect to serve with this program in the
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um well with the Alzheimer's
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
disease and related dementia Grant we
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
currently um sort of a little over 250
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
individuals um our respit grants
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
currently are about $2,000 which um
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
depending on what the needs are of that
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
individual it can give them a a good
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
amount of RIT um and support but we can
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
approve uh more if needed so it is
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
individual um and we would be monitoring
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
um how much we would be um able to
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
authorize for each family caregiver to
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
receive that support so we anticipate um
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know a range of between um 100 to
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
another 200 individuals could um receive
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
that respit Grant depending on
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
follows are follow follow up thank you
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
and so how did you arrive at okay I
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
heard you what you just said in terms of
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
your funding um how did you arrive at
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
that number that you that you have in
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
the bill here um we we use that um to
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
align with the parody or the um the the
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
grant that we offer through our older
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
Americans act um uh family caregiver
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
program so we we benchmarker that's the
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
Baseline for what we would offer for a
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
grant but if the needs um are are more
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
we are able to take that into
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
consideration and approve more thank you
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
no further questions other
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
question say no other questions okay
 
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:25.029 align:start position:0%
question say no other questions okay
thank

00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Doug
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
mcnut so well whoops I'll be quick for
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Doug mcnut I'm
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
here today representing the commission
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
on Hampshire State Commission on Aging
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
which is fully supportive of this bill
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
in a prior life I served in Wendy's
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
position within the department so I'm
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
very familiar with the programs and
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
really what I want to emphasize this
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
morning is these are programs that take
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of small amounts of money and
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
in particular with the non Alzheimer's
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
funding these are volunteers who are
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
providing these services so if you think
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
about an aging population and how are we
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to take care of them uh for
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
example my wife does transportation
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
services here in conquered for the
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
friends program she's a volunteer she
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
does shopping for people these are vital
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
services that keep people at home and uh
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
again at very low cost because we're
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
talking about volunteers and so given
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have the kind of work
 
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
force shortages that we do these
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
programs are vital and not only that
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
these programs take advantage of federal
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
funding most of these agencies do their
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
own internal fundraising so there's a
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
real bang for your buck in the small
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
amounts of money that are involved you
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
know in this legislation
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of the uh Alzheimer's and uh
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
disease Related Disorders grants that is
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
a program that is very effective in
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
terms of not only keeping people at home
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
potentially off Medicaid as well so you
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
know there's a real value in doing this
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
and uh taking advantage frankly of a
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
volunteer force that is growing uh in
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
terms of uh Alzheimer's and Dementia
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
Related Disorders we know that
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
as people get older they're more likely
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
to to uh end up with dementia so these
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
are really important programs I would
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
argue they're real bang for your buck
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
and uh that's all I have to say I'd be
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
question I've heard this from now three
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
people and I'm really curious do you
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
have any idea having been in that
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
position previously what percentage of
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
the people that administer services are
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
actually volunteers
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
well when you're talking about the
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
senior companion Foster grandparent and
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh RSVP programs those are
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
volunteers when you're talking about the
 
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's program you're talking about
 
00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
grants to caregivers to provide respit
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
so that's paid but um they're run
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
through the service link program which
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
is run by the state and so there's other
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer efforts that are associated
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
with that as
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
well follow up follow up I'm curious
 
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
where do the grants come from so the um
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
senior volunteer programs are run by the
 
00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:37.590 align:start position:0%
senior volunteer programs are run by the
um

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh well the admin what used to be called
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
the administration on Aging I don't know
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
what it's called now Administration for
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
Community Living I think and those are
 
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
grants that are funded to the states and
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh the senior volunteer programs are
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
actually senior volunteer programs are a
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
separate Federal program there is a
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
federal agency that runs all these
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
senior volunteer programs and the Name
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
Escapes me at present but that's where
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
the funding comes
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
thank also signed up to speak is Lily

services at the friends program um it's
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
my pleasure to speak to you today about
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
two senior volunteer programs that we
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
operate one is the retired and Senior
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer program that is um what Mr
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
mcnut was talking about with the
 
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
americore senior Grant um and the other
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
is the fost grandparent program so I
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
want to start with RSVP which is what
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
it's often reduced
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
to this is essentially a program there
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
are six operating currently in the state
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and our job is to
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
assess where the gaps in each Community
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
are how do we fill those gaps with
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers specifically senior
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
volunteers so we are recruiting training
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
and supporting anyone over the age of 55
 
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
who wants to help us meet these critical
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
Community needs so for the program that
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
we operate we cover Rockingham marac
 
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
bellnap and straford counties one of our
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
main components is around caregiving
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
Medical Transportation has skyrocketed
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
the need for seniors vulnerable citizens
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
to get to and from medical appointments
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
I can't stress enough how significant it
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
is um we received a phone call several
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
months back from a woman who said I can
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
see conquered Hospital from my house I
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
can't get there three times a week for
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
dialysis she had no other option other
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
than to go into long-term care we thre a
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
Hail Mary we asked our volunteers if
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to transport her three
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
times a week for 6 a.m. dialysis and in
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
one day we had six months of medical
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
rides secured for her to and from
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
dialysis that saved someone's life in
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
addition these volunteers are filling
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
their days with something deeply
 
00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
meaningful and they are the best
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
advocates for this programming we hear
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
time and time again that they get more
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
out of it than they could ever possibly
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
give I could speak for a very long time
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
about the stories of impact I won't but
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
long story short this is keeping elderly
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
vulnerable citizens at home we had
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
someone who was discharged this week
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
following an extensive abdominal surgery
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
she's 90 years old she would not be able
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
to return home if it were not for her
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
volunteer sh shoer who not only arranged
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
to pick her up he's going to pick up her
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
prescriptions he's going to grocery shop
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
for her he's going to make sure that
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
she's settled in at home she's 90 and
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
home I also am here today to speak about
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
the Foster grandparent program so this
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
is the other program that we operate
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
again it's using exclusively senior
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
volunteers this is a often misunderstood
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
program it's really classroom
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
grandparents so so our foster
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
grandparents classroom grandparents are
 
00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:34.519 align:start position:0%
in schools across New Hampshire they are
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
in nonprofit preschools and daycares and
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
after school
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
programs thank you you could start
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
wrapping up though yeah this is a
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
program about deep meaning um they are
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
serving anywhere from five all the way

acquiring alternative temporary care for

break while knowing that their loved one

nursing facility or in assisted living
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
facilities and this provides temporary
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
relief that enables an opportunity for a
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
caregiver to deal with their own manage

Hampshire's adrd breast bit grant
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
program is one of the services that the
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
brain health public awareness campaign
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
as Wy alluded to is going to be
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
highlighting and given the fact that New
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire continues to age and we exper
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
expect rates of Alzheimer's dementia to
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
continue to grow we do anticipate an
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
incre increased need for this program
 
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
with hp704 we will be increasing the
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
funding to the adrd reate grant program
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it will not only help reduce burnout
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
for caregivers that people who care for
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
loved ones with Alzheimer's or dementia
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
experience at very high rates but it
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
will also help delay individuals from
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
needing to go into more costly living
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
situations in a more restrictive
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
environment um it is vitally
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
inappropriate is vitally appropriate
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me that when appropriate if an
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
individual so chooses that they're able
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
to stay at their home as long as
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
possible and preventing caregiver
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
burnout for those caring for loved ones
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
with living loved ones living with
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's or dementia is instrumental
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
ensuring that choice exists so we're
 
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
definitely in support of hp704 and happy
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question would you
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
believe that I'm fortunate enough to
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
work with highlevel athletes and one of
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
the most important parts of training is
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
called rest and we actually pay them to
 
00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
do that and I would say that it's
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful work you're doing that allows
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
these people to have that same
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to rest I I would absolutely
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
believe that representative thank you
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
for the question other
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
26,500 by 250 so it looks like this
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
programs serve approximately 1% 1% of uh
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
of population uh who might need it is it
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
accurate uh assessment thank you for the
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
question representative math is
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
definitely not my strong suit so I I
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
won't question your math certainly it is
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
a small population that is being served
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
by this program and that is definitely
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we're increasing
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
looking for an increase and funding
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
specifically for that we're so grateful
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
to partner with the Department with the
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
funding that the legislature provided on
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
the public awareness campaign to shine a
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
light on this program so that more
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who may be able to access it
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
will be able to access It ultimately
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
benefiting them as caregivers their
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
families and the state as a whole in
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
terms of allowing individuals to stay in
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
their homes um longer if that's what
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
they so choose to do thank you other
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
Maser yes thank you for taking my
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
question um so I am looking back at the
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and it says so fiscal year
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
2025 there's no allocations there so
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
what are you currently using for what's
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
currently being used for funding this so
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
for the adrd RIT Grant specifically I
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
believe and I'm sure the department
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
would be able to give more accurate
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
numbers but it's funded with General
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
funds at $32 or so thousand this would
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
be a year this would raise it up to
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
about $552 00,000 for the adrd Prospect
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
Grant specifically and I will Wendy is
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
nodding that I am correct in
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
that so it about it' be roughly an
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
increase in this specifically for the
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
$250,000 representative
 
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
wver thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you happen to have
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
off the top of your head or could you um
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
provide us or perhaps somebody in the
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
department provide us uh the cost of
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
caring for somebody who receives
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and who is uh in a nursing home
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
and needs dementia care I do not have
 
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
that number off the top of my head
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative but I'd be happy to get
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
it from you or make sure it would be
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
helpful in terms of understanding the
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
costs that the state is being spared if
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
people can appropriately remain in their
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
home with the appropriate support
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
I will I will make sure we get you that
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
number representative thank I will point
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
out attorney Williams had given me
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
numbers indicating that people Aging in
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
place and again this could vary
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
depending on their condition but it's
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
24,000 if they stay in home versus
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
74,000 if they go to a nursing home so I
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's true in all
 
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
incidents but that's I guess that's an
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
average number so I I don't know if that
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
sounds I I certainly would say that I
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
think we're all definitely aware that
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
allowing a person to be able to stay in
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
their home if they so choose is at a
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
much lower cost than someone who needs
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
to be in more intensive environment and
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
especially if someone is able to stay in
 
00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:04.839 align:start position:0%
a less intensive environment of care
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate for them and that's
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
what they want to do that is absolutely
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
beneficial to them in terms of of their
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
Olivia parik and I live in Bow New
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today to testify in
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
Court of House Bill
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
704 I'm here today as someone who has
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
lived the reality of caregiving at just
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
21 years old my grandfather battled
 
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease for four years and
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
my family did everything possible to
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
care for him at home after his diagnosis
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we made the decision for my
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
grandparents to move in with us ensuring
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
that he had the support he needed
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
especially during the uncertainty of
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 at first we managed my
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
grandmother served as his primary career
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
giver and we all stepped in where we
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
could but soon it became
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
impossible he could no longer be left
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
alone he wandered outside and forgot
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
which house was ours he became confused
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
anxious and
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
paranoid late afternoons and evenings
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
with the sun Downing were the worst he
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
would become angry and argumentative my
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
grandmother exhausted could no longer
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
sleep in the same room because he didn't
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
recognize her and he would become
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
aggressive nights were unpredictable he
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
would stay awake wandering the house we
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
installed cameras door sensors and took
 
00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
shifts just to ensure his safety caring
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
for him wasn't just a responsibility it
 
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:09.079 align:start position:0%
consumed Our Lives even when we hired
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
help we were never truly off the clock
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
but it provided my family with the S the
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
small necessary breaks to keep up with
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
work and school having even a few hours
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
of rest bit allowed us to recharge and
 
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
continue providing the best care we
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
could supporting like this is essential
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
for families navigating the Relentless
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
demand of
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's it helps prevent burnout and
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
ensures loved ones can remain at home
 
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
longer with dignity and comfort
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's care is not just emotionally
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
exhausting it's financially
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
crippling from October to December 2023
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
we spent
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
$22,000 on home care for just two months
 
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't even 247
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
coverage that cost exceeded the monthly
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
cost of a nursing home where meals and
 
00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
around the-clock ha were included
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
when my grandfather eventually
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
transitioned into Memory Care the
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
financial strain only grew
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
$67,000 for five months at one nursing
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
home which is $113,000 per month
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
$448,000 for four months at another home
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
for $12,000 per month families like mine
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
will do whatever it takes to care for
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
our loved ones but it comes at an
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
unbearable cost the $2,000 program
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
provides it barely scratches the surface
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
but this is still a life
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
line and as the New Hampshire brain
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
health public awareness campaign
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
highlights this initiative more families
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
will discover this resource meaning
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
demand will rise without increased
 
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
funding many will be left without
 
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
options this issue is bigger than just
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
my family more than 11 a million
 
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
Americans provide unpaid care for a
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
loved one with Alzheimer's adding up to
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
18 billion hours of unpaid caregiving
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
each year the financial and emotional
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
burden leads to devastating burnout
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
nearly 60% of Alzheimer's caregivers
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
report high levels of stress anxiety and
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
depression I urge you to support House
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 704 and increase this funding
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
because caregivers need care too thank
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%

and the last 20 years have lived in
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
eping unfortunately I lost my wife for
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
50 years years to alzheimer's in
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
November 14th in
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
2022 I was a primary
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
caregiver a caregiver is someone who
 
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
helps another person on daily activities
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
or medical tasks a generic definition
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
very nice it's true a primary caregiver
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
for someone with Alzheimer's is much
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
more than that it's exhausting it's ugly
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
and is desperate those are the words
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
that I would have have to explain that
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
think of an airline attendant telling
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
you to put on your your mask before
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
helping those around you and imagine
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
there's only one mask and it's only good
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
for your loved one that's the example
 
00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
that that I would
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
give once I was so
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
exhausted that I set the security alarm
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
of my home shut off my phone and went to
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
bed in hopes that my wife would get a
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
few hours sleep I would as well I was
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
awoken about 2:00 in the morning with
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
the police at the bottom of my stairs
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
with my wife during during the evening
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
she woke up went downstairs and
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
proceeded to leave the house the alarm
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
went off and it scared her so she sat on
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
the front front steps the alarm company
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
called me but my phone was off because I
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't thinking they called the police
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
and luckily the police came over and was
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
would rectified the
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
situation that was quite alarming quite
 
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
honestly because without the alarm
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
system or without the care or without
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
the the quick response to uh the police
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
department my wife would have wandered
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
off at 2 or 3:00 in the
 
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:33.079 align:start position:0%
morning during this time I learned to
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
take a shower in under two minutes to
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
brush my teeth while talking to go to
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
the bathroom with the door wide open to
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
take naps rather than restful sleep and
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
to pretend to pretend things were better
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
than they actually were respirate Care
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
is a temporary short-term service that
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
provides relief to primary caregivers
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
who are responsible for the ongoing care
 
00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
of a loved one with chronic illness
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
disability or other meth other health
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
conditions it allows the caregivers to
 
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
take a break recharge and attend to
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
needs I was fortunate enough to have a
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
couple of friends that helped me in that
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
area one very special friend took my
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
wife once a week every week it allowed
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
me to go grocery shopping to run
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
necessary errands uh to go to medical
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
appointments Dental appointments I
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
cannot begin to tell you how important
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
that day was to me
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
not to be confused with a vacation
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
respirate care is desperately needed and
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
much appreciated please support this
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you any questions
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel sorry I have so
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
many questions thank you Mr chair um you
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
you've highlighted the three of you and
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
those before you've highlighted a number
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
of the problems that people incur by
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
taking care of their family members but
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious and this is very uh
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
important to me because yesterday I
 
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
actually took care of somebody that was
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
injured um on a memory unit taking care
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
of a combative um patient but I'm just
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
curious do you have any data on how many
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
family members are actually injured by
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
their loved ones and what the
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
ramifications are taking care of a
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
combative person Alzheimer's um I don't
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
have that data right now but I'm
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to look into it and see
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
if we can track down that information
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
for you but I would you know number of
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
people who are living in their homes
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
those challenges it's it's it's hard as
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
you alluded to and as you know Olivia
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
and John shared people can be combative
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
it's such a horrible disease that that
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
really can result in that and and there
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
is you know challenges with injuries and
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
Care follow up follow up so if if
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
somebody gets injured doing this is
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
there like a um outside of respit is
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
there a fallback position or um to help
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
them because suddenly they don't have
 
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
anybody for the primary caregiver that
 
00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
who was injured um not to my knowledge
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%

704 my husband Joe um experienced
 
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
symptoms of uh Alzheimer's for several
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
years prior to being diagnosed with
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
early onset Alzheimer's
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
um in June of 2021 at the age of
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
56 he uh was diagnosed with early onset
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's at the time we were under
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
the impression that it was going to be a
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
slow process and we'd have time to
 
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
prepare for the different aspects of the
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
disease but this was not the case for
 
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:22.910 align:start position:0%
disease but this was not the case for
Joe

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
um sorry he he experienced a um
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
a rapid motor
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
Decline and in August of
 
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559 align:start position:0%
2021 his job identified him as safety
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
work um all the physical fun things that
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
he was able to do like snowmobiling
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
driving making things out of metal
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
um Qui quickly disappear
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
years and he is currently in the severe
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
stages of Alzheimer's and he needs uh
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
24/7 support in all aspects of
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
life um Joe cannot be left alone he he's

a wonderful um person he he he likes to
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
come up and make a difference um I have
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
trouble getting everything that is
 
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
needed to be down around my house
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
because he used to to do a lot of things
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
around my house with my daughter I take
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
care of and
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
um there's not much out there in the way
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
of supporting someone so young with
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's um to continue trying to
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
live a quality life while keeping my
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
house running so uh I was at a loss what
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
to do in the beginning and was so
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
thankful when uh Tina goulette from the
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
contacted my family and told me about
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
the resit program
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
through service link and
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
gateways and um I can't express the
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
relief that it has been to get we
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
generally do four hours a week um my
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
brother who is retired um supports Joe
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
and he looks forward to it every
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
Wednesday as a matter of fact he comes
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
at 12: and takes him to the dump to the
 
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
grocery store and they go out to lunch
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
and he looks forward to it as much as
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know it it benefits me um the respit
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm able to do my h a little bit of
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
housework and go to the gym um to try to
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
maintain my own health um this grant has
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
served a two-fold purpose it's helped my
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
husband maintain his strength by going
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
into the community and building
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
Community around him um and also um
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
helps him to feel productive um in the
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
community um and it helps me to maintain
 
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
my ability to take care of both him and
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
my daughter currently L I received
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
$2,000 in respit which lasts about five
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
to six months my brother um so what
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
happens is when you apply for respit you
 
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
go through a company which is gateways
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
and service link and they will take a
 
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:12.799 align:start position:0%
portion of it so it's about you get
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
about 17
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%

thanks for being here today um that's
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
very nice of you I I had a question that
 
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
something that you said really intrigued
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
me you said that they reached out to you
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
how did they find out about you my uh we
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
had I think we had um I have my husband
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
out in the community a lot and I do um a
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
lot of things Joe used to testify for
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
different things relative to my daughter
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
who was disabled and I don't know how
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
she learned about what was going on with
 
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
my family my husband had attempted to
 
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
commit suici side um when this first
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
happened because of you know the way it
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
was presented to him and just basically
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
a hopeless kind of uh disease and
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
so I do not know how she learned about
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
that and so but it was a little bit of a
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
security risk when he came back to the
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
house because it happened when I was on
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
my walk in the morning and so they
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
helped me to put a security camera into
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
my house and and um I think that's how I
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
learned of the respit program I don't
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
remember how she knew about it you know
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
and so I was very grateful at the time
 
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
um that this was offered to help
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
maintain my ability to keep my husband
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
and my daughter both at home you know
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%

coming representative palaza thank you
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
question uh can you talk to your
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
experience of filing for this uh uh
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
resit program uh um like did you have
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
to um was there some requirements like
 
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
did you have to disclose your personal
 
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
financial situation or did you have to
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
take any training to qualify this
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
program or was there any requirement
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
making sure that you are vaccinated to
 
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
be in this
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
program no there was no no training um
 
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's to help um maintain
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
your ability to there is no training for
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
this type of a disease spr basically
 
00:55:41.549 --> 00:55:41.559 align:start position:0%
going to you're going to learn it as you
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
go and um the Alzheimer's Association
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
helps a lot they have a lot of um videos
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
on the on TV they have they don't have a
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
lot of support groups for people with
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
early onset Alzheimer's um it's
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
different it's a different um it's a
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
different diagnosis because so young and
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
it sometimes it happens quicker um and
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there was um trying to
 
00:56:07.359 --> 00:56:10.109 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there was um trying to
remember

00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I had to apply for it I believe had
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
to app I had to do like an application
 
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:18.039 align:start position:0%
for it and
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think there's a train was
 
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
there another question I'm sorry if I'm
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
not covering all your
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
questions oh J was it an easy process
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
and do do you have like to file any
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
reports like at the end of period uh um
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
like uh is it e a program to
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
apply you mean like any reports on what
 
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
I do with him you mean no I mean they
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
know I like I pretty much um tell them I
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
I do it with my daughter too I developed
 
00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
a a program so my husband can go out
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
into the community and to um be
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
supported to be able to the community
 
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
gets to know him and they get to know
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
um like you in the community they get to
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
know me and they just will offer help
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know so it's a great way
 
00:57:12.839 --> 00:57:14.270 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know so it's a great way
to

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
um to get the community to know a lot of
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
times people get isolated in their homes
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
um which is what's happens a lot of
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
people are afraid of the disease even
 
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
happens with my brother it's a very it's
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
very difficult because as a disease
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
Progressive you have to do all
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
activities of daily living and um so
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
when a person that doesn't have a lot of
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
experience because this is not you get
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
you're making they're not making money
 
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
they're just it's their time so a lot of
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
time so people that are they're not
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
going to have experience in it but it's
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
like instead of you know like just
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
keeping somebody at home or having them
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
see somebody socially it's really an
 
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
important program to keep funded and
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
actually it would be great to able to do
 
00:57:59.069 --> 00:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
it throughout the whole year um the
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
funding Runs Out unfortunately like in 5
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
to 6 months because um some the company
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
has to get paid a little bit to run the
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
the grant you know so um it makes it
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
difficult like last week the VNA people
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
came because my husband's motor issues
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
increased and I have to bring all kinds
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
of things into my house like a ramp like
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
a oer lift like a you know and so we're
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
not like we're just above I worked when
 
00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.039 align:start position:0%
I my husband had worked so we're not um
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
you know going to qualify for like real
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
poor we're just right above that like
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
line and um but I have to I have to
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
budget because I also have a daughter
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
that has uh 247 developmental
 
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
disabilities as well so I have to kind
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
of take care of both of them in my home
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
and um which is okay but appreciate the
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
support that this office because it
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
helps me every tiny little bit helps to
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
be able to sustain that it's a long like
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
when they say it's a long journey it's a
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
long journey and it's years of of of
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
having to uh think outside the box but
 
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of actual reporting there's not

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:35.240 align:start position:0%

heard a lot this morning we provide
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
respit to caregivers um so our
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
volunteers are older adults that cannot
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're not trained to provide any
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
Hands-On care but they can provide
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
respit to caregivers who might just want
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
to take a nap or mow the lawn or maybe
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
go out and tend to their own medical
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
needs so there are so many things that
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to talk about today that I we
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
benefits of volunteering later in life
 
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's been a lot of research about
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
how uh volunteering over in your 50s and
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
and above um provides all kinds of
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
health benefits it gives our a sense of
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
purpose it also is a big cost savings as
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
we've discussed earlier today and the
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
list goes on but there's also the
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
numbers involved um it for 50 years
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
approximately um our program has
 
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
partnered with cap um from in conquered
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
belut Marat cap U to provide
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
transportation respit and companionship
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire residents for nearly 50
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
years last fiscal year we provided
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
32827 7 hours of companionship to
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
343 homebound residents of New
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these aren't just numbers
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
these are 343 people who would otherwise
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
most likely have little to no human
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
interaction or access to the
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
community 343 people who without the
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
support of our program may not have had
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
enough food to get through the week or
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
access to routine medical appointments
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
or prescribed medications these 32,8
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
27 hours are life sustaining yes but
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
they are so much more they are a few
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
hours every week where the primary focus
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
is the person making them smile making
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
them laugh reminding them that someone
 
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
in the world cares about them their
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
existence and their happiness
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
matters on the other side of things we
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
do the resit piece
 
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
4,968 hours of respit was provided to
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
caregivers in the state of New New
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at no
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
cost these hours provide rest um excuse
 
01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
me these hours provide caregivers the
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to tend to their own medical
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
needs to like I said MOG a la take a nap
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%

child growing up and this bill is very
 
01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
important I would encourage you all to
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
deeply ask yourself what does it mean to
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
you because I'm sure you all must have
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
someone struggling and I would ask that
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
you all would highly take this bill
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%

also representing London Derry and and
 
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
um well this HB 743 this bill is looking
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
to uh get some upfront uh price pricing
 
01:16:37.149 --> 01:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
and also some pricing transparency which
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
the uh Federal Law requires and I've had
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
a few constituents who've also been you
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
know complained to me about this matter
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
not the least of which is my wife as
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
well uh one of my constituents writes uh
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
that he got a $1,800 bill with no
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
details no clues what it's for leaves
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
leads to an very awkward situation when
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
you have to call them up and battle
 
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
after the fact of what's going on what
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
other industry gets away with this uh
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
can you imagine a Contractor Building
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
your house and then sending you the bill
 
01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
when it's when it's all done later
 
01:17:12.199 --> 01:17:13.110 align:start position:0%
when it's when it's all done later
totally

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
totally
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
intolerable so the bill you have in
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
front of you is uh well inspired by the
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill that passed in Maine bipartisanly I
 
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
asked OS to rewrite it to make maybe
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
work for New Hampshire um I've already
 
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
got some criticism about it that it
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't go far enough so there's other
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
other states out there that have also uh
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh done this kind of stuff um Rhode
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
Island Florida
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
Colorado and I also like to point out
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
that uh on the federal level there's
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
some more stuff coming down the pike
 
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
which uh gives some price transparency
 
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
to um well every aspect of uh the
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
medical Comm Community all the way down
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
to your doctor's office and I think
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's being inspired by Bernie Sanders
 
01:17:59.310 --> 01:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
of all people so I would suggest that
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
maybe we could get out front on this
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
issue uh with that um I think I'm
 
01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
done any questions for representative
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
sodi representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing up this topic
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's a really important one um I I just
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
had two questions actually um what does
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
this bill accomplished that federal law
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
does not accomplish now well right now
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's woful inadequate what's going on
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh because you're not getting the prices
 
01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.229 align:start position:0%
uh because you're not getting the prices
up

01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
front uh in fact uh the testimony that's
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
going to follow for my wife will be some
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
extra examples of that so I don't want
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
to spoil that testimony yet can I ask a
 
01:18:45.149 --> 01:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
followup followup I'm just curious why
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
were pharmacists excluded from this oh I
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
think uh there's some other bills that
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
some other representatives are going to
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
be working on uh that are going to be
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
putting that in
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
McLean uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so um you say
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill uh passed in Maine but
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
also that there are versions in Rhode
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
Island Colorado and Florida yeah um how
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
long has that uh how long has that been
 
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
the case I'm assuming Maine is just very
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
recent yes it is um what about these
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
other states can you give us Rhode
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
Island is pretty recent as well and and
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
I think they're all pretty recent
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
actually okay followup question Mr chair
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair um so have
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
you spoken to anybody um in theur in the
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
insurance department or because I
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
noticed that the the first part of it
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
kind of Builds on the federal no
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
surprises law for the uninsured um but
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
there are certain mandates that you're
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
putting in on the insurance companies
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering if the
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
insurance department had any feedback oh
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
they're coming up they're here oh he
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
already I've already got some complaints
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
hold fire thank
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions saying no other questions
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
okay also signed up to speak is Ben

Association

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Ben
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
Bradley I represent all 26 hospitals in
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire as well as
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
all specialty hospitals um we appreciate
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to discuss HB 743 we
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
are opposed to the bill not because we
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
oppose patient access to healthcare
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
prices and billing practices but because
 
01:20:45.310 --> 01:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
the bill is redundant and could create
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
conflicting standards between federal
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
and state law in a way that duplicates
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements for transparency
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
and increases regulatory burden and cost
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
on Healthcare Serv services and patients
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
Federal Hospital Tri price transparency
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
rules went into effect on January 1 2021
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
and require all hospitals to make
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
available on their websites a single
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
machine readable digital file containing
 
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
the standard charges for all items and
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
services provided by a hospital Federal
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
Regulations also give hospitals two
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
options to let consumers determine their
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
potential out-of-pocket costs for common
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
Services an interactive price estimator
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
tool or a static spreadsheet listing 300
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
common Services those regulations are
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
required by federal law and are enforced
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
by the centers for Medicare and Medicaid
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
services CMS I also want to point out
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire led the nation several
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
years ago when the department of
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
insurance first published the
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
comprehensive New Hampshire Health cost
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
website which allows consumers to
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
compare prices for various procedures
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
across several providers including
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals contrary to the comments from
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
years in New Hampshire there are several
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
ways for p Pati s to view costs for
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
services and receive a good faith

estimate of those Services prior to
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%

fed Federal Regulations while some
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
advocates for this bill claim the
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
legislation is necessary due to lack of
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement and negligible fines on
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals data from CMS available
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
publicly on their website shows exactly
 
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
the opposite anyone can go on the CMS
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
website and view the thousands of
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
compliance notifications and fines
 
01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:25.719 align:start position:0%
imposed by CMS across the country since
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
the rule took
 
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
effect this bill resembles HB 389 from
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
last legislative session that was ited
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%

testimony Advocates said the purpose of
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is to hold hospitals
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
accountable for not complying with
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
federal law as noted CMS is the Arbiter
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
of compliance for these regulations and
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
we ask why duplicate efforts that would
 
01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
require State Investments for the
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
to do investigations into hospitals

compliance with Federal transparency
 
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
regulations when CMS is already doing
 
01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
that advocates for this bill have also
 
01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
highlighted that other states have
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
enacted similar legislation I've talked
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
to my colleagues in other states around
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
the country one in particular said their
 
01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
has not received a single complaint for
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with Federal transparency
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
regulations since their since their
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
state law passed this is a solution in
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
search of a problem that does not exist
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
of all I've included additional material
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
with my testimony that you may find
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
helpful when considering this bill
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
during the summer of 2022 our hospitals
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
began receiving emails from a national
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
special interest group called patient
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%

claims about individual hospitals
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
compliance with the federal no surprises
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
act these claims are false I've attached
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
a chart that shows the inconsistency and
 
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
inaccurate criteria used by the special
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
interest group in their analysis of
 
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital compliance with the NSA and
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
they do not use the same requirements in

they do not use the same requirements in

01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
their

analysis for these reasons we cannot
 
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
support hb5 uh excuse me HB 743 and I'd
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions thank
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you any

McLean thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um just for
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
for and it's my understanding that no
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
surprises does a lot you know for the
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
uninsured and stuff like that but if you
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
are insured like an employer insured
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
like a lot of people people you you you
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't get the same kind of quoting and
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
things like that so with the tools that
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
we have set up in the state already
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
could you maybe walk me through a
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
scenario where a person who maybe is
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
going in for hip surgery for example but
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
they have employer-based
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
insurance how are they what what what
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
mode would they take to go through to
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
get the The Upfront pricing that they
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
needed so not unur they have employer
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
based Insurance maybe we just kind of
 
01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
walk us through what that path might
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
look like thank you for the question
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative sorry for rifling through
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
my testimony I really just wanted to
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
make sure I got it on the record and I
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to discuss
 
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
this further New Hampshire has done a
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
great job of uh establishing a health
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
cost website through the Department of
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance it does afford uh uh an
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
ability for patients to compare prices
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
across multiple providers and they can
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
can select whether they are insured who
 
01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
their um insurance provider is and whe
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
or whether they're uninsured and it will
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
provide estimates across several um
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
several uh
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
procedures uh several common procedures
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh that patients can uh filter through
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
select multiple providers uh that are
 
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
included in that uh database and then
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
get an estimate for what that uh cost
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
could be out of even out of pocket um I
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
believe the department of insurance is
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
here and they be may be able to speak
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
more into the capabilities of that uh
 
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719 align:start position:0%
platform I think it is actually probably
 
01:26:08.669 --> 01:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
even more useful than the
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
federal um uh resources that are a
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
static spreadsheet uh or um their their
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
price estimator tool so this is really
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
local this is focused on what's going on
 
01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh and I would
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
just point patient to that as well as uh
 
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
our providers uh at hospitals who are uh
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
required to provide a good faith
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
estimate of the expected cost for those
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
Services if they are
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
uninsured follow
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
up thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
question so um and and I'm aware of the
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh the the the cost estimator um on on
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
the government website um but one of the
 
01:26:52.109 --> 01:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
things about no surprises it's my
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it has teeth
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
because if the quote is provided and the
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
final bill comes in and it has
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely no relation um to what the
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
quote was that
 
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
there's the patient is really going to
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
be insulated a little bit from that can
 
01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
you speak a little bit to um with the
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
the State website um is there anything
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
binding uh if uh a provider really um
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
goes far off pace from from that um from
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
what is being put out on the website
 
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I I don't know the answer to
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
that specific question but I do want to
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
hit on the no surprises acts act
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
legislation at the federal level because
 
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
CMS does say that if the estimated
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
amount is a difference of
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
$400 you know one way or another then
 
01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
you can um you can dispute that that
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
that price uh compared to the estimate
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
that you received you can dispute the
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
the cost if it is uh in excess of
 
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
$400 um and and that uh then has binding
 
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
expectations for the provider um Who
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
provided that um Who provided that good
 
01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.950 align:start position:0%
provided that um Who provided that good
faith

01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
estimate other
 
01:28:21.109 --> 01:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
Senator also signed up to speak is
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
red all right hello everybody um as you
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
know I am uh Julia sodi the primary
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh wife living in wiam New
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um before I begin my testimony
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
I would like to
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh quickly address um actually some of
 
01:28:59.310 --> 01:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
the points that uh the hospital
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
Association repres representative Ben
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
Bradley just brought forward um he
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh consumers nowadays
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
have multiple Avenues of uh getting to
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
the the prices Healthcare prices and he
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that website established by
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance commission just recently I
 
01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
was on that website to look for how much
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
a particular procedure costs which is
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
also um a matter of legislative action
 
01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:29.910 align:start position:0%
also um a matter of legislative action
recently

01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision was not listed in there I
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if he can find it I put in
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
the word and that's a pretty common
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
procedure and no price has come up on
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
that another thing that uh women
 
01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:43.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately often encounter is
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy I put in the word nothing
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
came up another procedure that I
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
actually recently had which I will
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
include in my testimony testimony was a
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
breast MRI women with dense breasts
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
often um get a breast MRI that would be
 
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
the most definitive um test to determine
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
if they have any cancer uh in addition
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
to a mamogram and an ultrasound nothing
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
came up on that website I don't know if
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm doing anything wrong but uh I have
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
looked at other procedures that have
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
come up these have not so just to bring
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
that up and uh what Bill uh what this
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill would accomplish that the federal
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't um I assume also is um to
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
provide the information to patients that
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
they can request us that this actually
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
would be displayed in hospitals very
 
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
often um patients have no idea what the
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
federal law is I myself didn't find out
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
about this until recently when somebody
 
01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention Dr Marty mcui
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
who's a um a hot thing nowadays who has
 
01:30:49.109 --> 01:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
written a blind spots in medicine he
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
also has uh written uh unaccountable and
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
the price we pay books I've all listened
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
to which all address this issue and he
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
was behind the federal law um and which
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
fortunately has passed um um Mr Bradley
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
has referred to the patient advocacy
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
organization um as a special interest
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
group which I have also found and I find
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
that they are volunteers who are doing
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
an amazing job I have also printed that
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
list which he calls misleading I don't
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
know maybe that's something the
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee should look into who am I to
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
say if it is leting or not but it says
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's largest hospitals are
 
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
listed over there as non-compliant on
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
pricing data sufficiency rating perhaps
 
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
for the same same reason where uh which
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
I just mentioned that the other website
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
U has that you can't find all the
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
procedures or what I found in one
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
um well the three minute went by
 
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
fast in in one situation they say um
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
that the details are not available so
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like a kevat there's the
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
list but they say sorry we don't have
 
01:31:59.709 --> 01:31:59.719 align:start position:0%
the details of the price so something
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
for for the committee to look into am I
 
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
able to uh a few minutes that was your
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
testimony if you written a written copy
 
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
we're happy to put it on record and and
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
or if you want to submit copies online
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
or whatever thank you but are there any
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
questions for Mrs
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
S representative
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr jar and thank you for
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um your husband
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
that you had gotten into a bill dispute
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
um with the insurance company and that
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
it was difficult because you didn't have
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
a breakdown of all the different items
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
and so it's very difficult to dispute
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
something because I just have an overall
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
um did you go back and require or or
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
request um a breakdown and it was not uh
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
offered or what was the situation with
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
that I I do think they have to provide a
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
breakdown list yes yes and I think he
 
01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
was actually referring to another
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
constituent who had that issue recently
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh I personally had that issue and yes
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
once you request it they will send you
 
01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
an itemized list in my particular CL uh
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
case what they are uh billing me and
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
actually what I'm in collection for um
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
is the doctor's uh reading fee so a
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
radiologist's fee for for that breast m
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
which I had done which Salem Radiology
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
the company I went to to find out how
 
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
much uh I would pay for this as a
 
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
self-pay because insurance said they
 
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cover it now they said they
 
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
have a policy that if you have insurance
 
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
even if Insurance decides not to cover
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
it you have to use your insurance so
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't give me a price at first
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
the technician told me oh if you are
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
self-paid did you know how expensive
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
this procedure is I said yeah probably
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
about $11,000 I'm prepared to pay that
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
he's like no this is 9,000 like are you
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
kidding me so I got dressed and left and
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
called my insurance company and said um
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
I have to go through you how much how
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
much am I going to be liable for and
 
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:06.280 align:start position:0%
they said we have no idea you have to
 
01:34:08.830 --> 01:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
ask the provider said how come the
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
provider is not telling me you don't
 
01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
know could you help me could you call
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
the provider to get this price so they
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
were on the phone with me and they
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
called a number of providers some of
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
which they couldn't reach just like I
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't they wouldn't pick up the phone
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
they left a message
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
and so what I ended up doing going into
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
Salem R Radiology sitting down and
 
01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
finding a person who could actually give
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
me a quote they said it's going to be
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
$400 big difference between 9,000 and
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
400 I was like oh sure you know I'm
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
ready for that I'm going in for that
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
procedure um they said if you pay now we
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
even give you a 10% discount and I said
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay great so here's the money am I am I
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
do I owe you something for the
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
radiologist I'm sure there's going to be
 
01:34:51.149 --> 01:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
a radiologist involved oh we have no
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
clue about that I thought there was a
 
01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:54.669 align:start position:0%
clue about that I thought there was a
law

01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
and it is part of this bill that any any
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
radiologist or basically additional
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
third party provider will have to be um
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
to displayed or what is the word to so
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
that the patient knows who that person
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
is so that at least if they don't know
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
the price I could call them up and say
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
how much are you going to charge
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
interestingly that $200 is in collection
 
01:35:20.109 --> 01:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
and I just found out most people have no
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
idea there is a law against that so I
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
have no idea how to fight it so now I'm
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to call the collection agency and
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
say New Hampshire has this law you can't
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
ask me for this money CU nobody told me
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
about it is that right so other
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
Weber have you ever contacted the
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
insurance department about resolving
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
this dispute no I have um no idea how to
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
access them I I don't know is there
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
phone number do I just type into Google
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department and
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
that would pop up and would you believe
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
that I my understanding is there's
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who's going to testify from
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
them but they have a very extensive
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
website yeah yeah so most people I
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
consider myself pretty educated in
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
health matters and being able to
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
advocate for myself and I had no idea so
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
I think the average person has no clue
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
that they have options that they are
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to uh be given prices that is
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
the federal law they don't know so are
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
there notices and and one thing I wanted
 
01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
to to mention about ambulance fee that I
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
got charged it was over
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
$4,000 for for something that could have
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
been completely avoided because I had my
 
01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
car and I was able to drive but at that
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
point I was already in Parkland
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
Medical's computer system and they
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
needed to Transit transport me to
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Hospital and they said we
 
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
would prefer you take the ambulance
 
01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
because now you're in our system we
 
01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
don't have to re-register you nobody
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
told me how much it was going to be and
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
even though the insurance pay over 3,000
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
they wanted to collect the 1500 left
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
over which I fought and they waved it
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
but what a waste of resources even for
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance company I could have just
 
01:37:06.669 --> 01:37:06.679 align:start position:0%
driven and saved that money and an
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
insurance cost would be much
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
less other
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%

thank you for the opportunity
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
um the insurance department has no
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
formal position on this bill excuse me
 
01:37:59.790 --> 01:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
can can everybody hear I'm
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay could you move that so the
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department has is neutral on
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
this bill um as a note there is another
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
house bill House Bill 705 that is within
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
our oversight and Authority it's about
 
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
price transparency and um our data unit
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
at the insurance department our Central
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
focus is healthc care price transparency
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
and the uh the woman previously
 
01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:24.390 align:start position:0%
and the uh the woman previously
testified

01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
testified
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
delineated a plethora of different
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
issues with that and we concur it is
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
indeed um a a Thicket of perplexing
 
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
price information oftentimes inaccurate
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
that the average consumer it's not
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
plausible that they can navigate through
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
that so we we acknowledge that is a
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
problem it's noteworthy that there are
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
indeed two federal laws one pertaining
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
to um hospitals and one pertaining to
 
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
health insurers that
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
NE necessarily organized like that to
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
kind of help patients and um analysts
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
and Regulators like us understand what
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
you might expect to pay when you have a
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
a real encounter versus just reference
 
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
pricing which has lower utility for for
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
the patient and and oversight individ
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
individuals um our New Hampshire Health
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
cost website which is referenced in this
 
01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
bill I think there's some
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings about how prices get
 
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
reported on there it's a very different
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
criteria compared to what both Federal
 
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
rules require for hospitals and insurers
 
01:39:36.589 --> 01:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
to post the CMS it used to be the CMS 50
 
01:39:39.589 --> 01:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
it turned into the CMS 300 and now it's
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
actually the CMS 500 medical services
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
that meet the eligibility requirement to
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
be reportable on those transparency um
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
mechanisms whether they're the consumer
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
friendly um mechan isms on their website
 
01:39:57.629 --> 01:39:57.639 align:start position:0%
or these machine readable files which
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
the federal rules also require for both
 
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
entities to
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
report um the machine readable files are
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
not consumable by our public they're
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
really for analysts researchers and
 
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
Regulators to essentially serve as a Rec
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
a validation data set or reconciliatory
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
data set to ensure that using other more
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
empirical observational data like the
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
claims data that there's Fidelity in
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
Billing with what the self-reported data
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
from these Federal requirements pose so
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's important to understand and it's
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
really a key limitation of these machine
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
readable files those are self-reported
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
by entities on what they say that they
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
charge the claims data is empirical it's
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
observational it's what the patient is
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
actually exposed to it's if you can
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
contextualize what I'm trying to say is
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
they're not always equal in fact the
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
insurance Department's primary interest
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
in getting the the transparency and
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
coverage data from insurers is to
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
validate that there's great Fidelity in
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
that and what the P the patient might
 
01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
see what they can expect to pay and what
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
they actually pay but I did just want to
 
01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
make note you could start wrapping up
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
though please on the section that points
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
out the New Hampshire Health cost
 
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:18.679 align:start position:0%
website that is probably not comparable
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
with regards to serving the consumer on
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
all of the different services that are
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
delineated in the hospital price
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
transparency legislation which I see
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
this seems to
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
parallel with that I'll end there if you
 
01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank you
 
01:41:34.599 --> 01:41:37.990 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank you
representative

01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question at the beginning
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
of your testimony you referenced a
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
different bill on price transparency
 
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
could you give me that number again and
 
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
is that a bill before the legislature
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
right now now or is that one that we
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
passed previously current currently
 
01:41:59.950 --> 01:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
being heard right now um House Bill 705
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
705 thank you that re regards insurance
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
carriers not Hospital providers I I
 
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
think to mirror the federal approach it
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
might be most suitable to keep those
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
mutually exclusive from each other thank
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative Woods
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh sometimes uh
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
getting data down to the public is
 
01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
difficult uh you've alluded to that um
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
and just to point out and maybe you
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
could help uh identify how the disparity
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
because uh uh and you mentioned the word
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh charges versus
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh and a a a particular
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
entity May charge X for a procedure but
 
01:42:55.629 --> 01:42:55.639 align:start position:0%
after negotiation are completed except
 
01:42:55.639 --> 01:42:56.589 align:start position:0%
after negotiation are completed except
far

01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
lower uh as those two numbers sometimes
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
really don't Jive and how do how is that
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
sorted out for the person who's trying
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
to find out what I'm exposed
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
to that thank you for the question and
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's a good one complex one one thing we
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
aim to do on New Hampshire Health cost
 
01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:19.639 align:start position:0%
is to do that we stratify by insurer
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
type of insurance including the
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
uninsured as Mr Bradley said as well as
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
by provider and tangentially the
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
transparency and coverage files from the
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
insurers also are required to have three
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
files in network negotiated rates out of
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
network maximum charge amounts in a
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
prescription drug file the significance
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
of that is that Network status is a key
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
driver to Pro to cost exposure to a
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
patient so if a if a provider is in
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
network they will have a contract in a
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
negotiated allowed amount that's the
 
01:44:00.669 --> 01:44:00.679 align:start position:0%
maximum amount that a provider will be
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
required to pay for any given service
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
services are classified by codes billing
 
01:44:10.589 --> 01:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
codes usually CPT codes or hipic codes
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
but so the the negotiated amounts are
 
01:44:18.030 --> 01:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
the best approximation to the cost that
 
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
a patient will be exposed to and that's
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's one albe it not a perfect but one
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the most precise approaches to
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
informing patient populations about the
 
01:44:32.589 --> 01:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
economics of healthcare
 
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
encounters other
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um we we heard
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion from the hospital
 
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
Association about the the State website
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
and the you know the amount of
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
transparency that it provides um but
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
you're understanding of the role of that
 
01:44:59.310 --> 01:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
website if I understand you correctly is
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
not that it is going to be giving you
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
cost information in the same way that no
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
surprises would give cost information to
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
the uninsured who are requesting a quote
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
it has a completely different role am I
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
correct in that your assessment of what
 
01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:18.679 align:start position:0%
that is you're really smart about
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
insurance everything I've heard you say
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
just shows how much Insight you have I
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
AG AG ree mostly with that I think one
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
key thing to point out our um
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility with New Hampshire Health
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
costs is in fact that to be responsible
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
in publishing claims-based price
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
estimates that are are very um stable
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
what we notice is wild price variability
 
01:45:46.589 --> 01:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
with with providers for any given
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
service it's astonishing to see for any
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
given individual CPT code individual
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
health care service how wildly variable
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
the prices are that's the essence of the
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
issue the these other advents to
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
communicate price information they do
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
not use claims-based data to do that
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
they they use contractually based
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
self-reported information which
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
presumably within each entity will not
 
01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
vary nearly as widely as the claims
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
based approach so there's advantages and
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
disadvantages to each and I think after
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
after having heard some of the testimony
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
from people from the public and and
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
members uh you know from the hospital
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
Association we probably can do a better
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
job communicating that to the reader you
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
know the nature of these data and how to
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
best interpret them to get a sense for
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
you know what their true exposure to
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
cost implications from an individual
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
healthc care encounter might be but we
 
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
published the median paid amount for
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
services that are ubiquitous in the
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we often times
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
find ourselves censoring certain
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
Services because they start to not meet
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
the condition of what we call curtosis
 
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
or essentially wild price variability we
 
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
want a very
 
01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
narrow range of variation in the price
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
and when we can't ensure that we can't
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
responsibly share that with the New
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or American public and that's
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
important to us that way follow
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
up so I I think then that might be why a
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy for example which was cited
 
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
earlier was not included on the list but
 
01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
just as a different question um
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
obviously you have no position on this
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill but is there anything about this
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
bill um that would potentially
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the insurance Market um in
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do you see any concerns
 
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
from the insurers about that that they
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
see red flags uh with respect to their
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
ability or to deliver service in the
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
state thank you for your question the
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
only thing I would point out is what I
 
01:48:01.149 --> 01:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned that there the
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
section on here that uh relates to
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier price transparency and
 
01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
given the fact that there already is a
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
current bill and that the federal
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
government has chosen to bifurcate the
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
the two entities and rightfully so I
 
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
wholly believe in the Credence of that
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
that we should aim to do the same in
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
this state I do LW representative so
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
sod's efforts on this and think that
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
state authority to oversee ensure and
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
and at times if necessary
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
enforce um
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with the with these
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
report reporting uh standards I think
 
01:48:44.589 --> 01:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
that there's Merit in that I I wholly
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
agree with Mr Bradley's commentary about
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
CMS reporting their non-compliance
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
issues and there there is rather modest
 
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
if little at all um enforcement action
 
01:48:59.550 --> 01:48:59.560 align:start position:0%
taken on I know two hospitals in Georgia
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
had last year been fined mightily might
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
I say but I think that different than
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
how I think a lot about government this
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
is a good example of how State Authority
 
01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
might better serve the citizenry because
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
we can we have a more intimate knowledge
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
of the healthc Care delivery system and
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
we could act more swiftly and I think
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
have suff efficient resources to ensure
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
stronger compliance from both hospitals
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
and insurers and taken
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
together that's um I'm very optimistic
 
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
that that that there is Credence here so
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
I think that if we separated the two
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
bills and we're fortunate enough to see
 
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
them move forward then that could help
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
citizens in the work that we do and the
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Hospital Association
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
does representative Weber
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas did you still have
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
or representative McLean addressed my
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank
 
01:50:05.550 --> 01:50:05.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber thank you so if
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
a consumer has a concern about um the
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
payments made under their employer
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
insurance or other insurance do you have
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
in the insurance department because I'm
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
far less familiar than is my my
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
colleague to my right uh do you assist
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
people who are in dispute with their um
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers or health care
 
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
providers and is some kind of Ombudsman
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
or uh consumer protection available
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
through your department thank you for
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
your question yes oftentimes multiple
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
times a week we get through our consumer
 
01:50:48.189 --> 01:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
services division um citizens call and
 
01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
providers sometimes call on with
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
grievances about those those disp
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
arities and we use many different data
 
01:50:59.550 --> 01:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
sets to help investigate and and often
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
times it really comes down to educating
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
the the patient the citizen and it's not
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
always a comfortable situation because
 
01:51:10.069 --> 01:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
ouch I mean I'm hearing the work that we
 
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
do every day to to be responsible about
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
communicating price information on New
 
01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health cost I'm hear and that
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
get criticized and we we do we become
 
01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
conditioned to that criticism because
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
we've learned that it it's a very
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
challenging economic and
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
financial um construct to to educate
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
people on and we never we're never
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
dealing with people who are happy at the
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
moment with our with the insurance
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
department nor the health care delivery
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
system so we use the claims data and
 
01:51:44.910 --> 01:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
we've been successful with both the
 
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
transparency and coverage data and from
 
01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
insurers and the hospital price
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
transparency data finding their
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
self-reported reference
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
charges and comparing them to what the
 
01:51:59.709 --> 01:51:59.719 align:start position:0%
patient has seen on New Hampshire Health
 
01:52:03.310 --> 01:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
cost to to validate and reconcile that
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
and so we there's High utility for
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
US Representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question this
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be Wicked complex I'm sorry
 
01:52:16.589 --> 01:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
I'm a dinosaur I've been in private
 
01:52:19.069 --> 01:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
practice for 35 years the guy next to me
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
is even more of a dinosaur as I think
 
01:52:23.310 --> 01:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
you know but anyway I have felt I need
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
to say that um I've this bill really
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
strikes a nerve with me because it's a
 
01:52:30.669 --> 01:52:30.679 align:start position:0%
big problem it's forced me to do
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
something I really don't want to do it's
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
I have to look at the insurance status
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
of all my patients which I really don't
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
like doing we're seeing a number of
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
Trends and I think it's a good thing but
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
there are unintended consequences to
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
everything prior authorization is a good
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
thing however now I have an entire
 
01:52:49.069 --> 01:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
department in my office that does
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
nothing prior but prior authorization
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
which creates cost for me and the
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
patient and the system workers
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
compensation same thing it same thing
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
the reality is is the dollar amount for
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
each patient is patient centered it's
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
very individual and every patient's
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances are different so now we
 
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
have to have a department that will talk
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
to each individual patient at Great cost
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
what do you see as the ramifications to
 
01:53:16.270 --> 01:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
cost to the system of doing this and are
 
01:53:18.189 --> 01:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
there better ways to do
 
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
this thank you and indeed I agree that
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
is a complex question question so you
 
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
know economic theory might pause it such
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
that the the reason why that price
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
variation exists and exist so mightily
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
and is in fact a problem for the Whole
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
Health Care system is the fact that we
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
have very little price awareness and
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
uing to that is very little price
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
sensitivity price sensitivity is a a
 
01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:46.360 align:start position:0%
concept where people will seek out lower
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
cost Alternatives holding quality
 
01:53:51.629 --> 01:53:51.639 align:start position:0%
constant if they're aware of prices we
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
do it in all segments of our economy and
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is just one of the segments
 
01:53:58.589 --> 01:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
where we don't do that and I argue one
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the main reasons why is because why
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
would we if we have no idea what the
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
price is there's no underlying Financial
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
incentive or motivation for us to do
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
that so in economics too we have short
 
01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
run intermediate and then long run
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
effects what you're talking about to
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
make it better I I perceive as a long
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
run economic effect of making all mooms
 
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
of trans Arcy available to the system so
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
that people can get more price aware and
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
more price sensitive it's not going to
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
happen in next legislative session see
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
we we pass these bills and the prices
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
are the same I knew that wouldn't work
 
01:54:39.149 --> 01:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
that's not something that we should ever
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
expect by the power of our pens in this
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
room rather we need to start
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
incrementally and systematically making
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
people and making entities more um
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
transparent about the prices and it over
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
time I think and I think a lot of my
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
colleagues Nationwide who I work on
 
01:55:00.069 --> 01:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
these same
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
Endeavors um think that holistically
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
price transparency will make our system
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
function more optimally and that's
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
that's important it's a thoughtful
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
question and that's how I think of it
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's really the long run um effect of
 
01:55:19.229 --> 01:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
multiple iterations in multiple sectors
 
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
of the healthcare industry being more
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
trans trans arent it's astonishing that
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
we don't know what we're going to pay if
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
you go to any Supermarket that has over
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
180,000 distinct units with distinct
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
prices we know within the 5cent in
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
increment what we're going to pay
 
01:55:39.149 --> 01:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
gasoline is within the n910 of a cent
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
increment what we're going to pay yeah
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
for something so important as health
 
01:55:46.109 --> 01:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
care even people who are Health policy
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
experts that work on this daily don't
 
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
know what they're going to pay until 3
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
months later when they get that
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
hyperbolic bill
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
this this endeavor May aim to offer
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
relief in
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
transparency follow a a followup rep
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
fair to say then we're looking at a
 
01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
short-term increase in cost for a
 
01:56:08.669 --> 01:56:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
cost it's not unfair to say that I think
 
01:56:13.709 --> 01:56:13.719 align:start position:0%
the magnitude everything comes with a
 
01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
cost our our health care System comes
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
with Mighty cost I'll refer you to the
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
insurance Department's total healthare
 
01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:23.159 align:start position:0%
expenditure model that we just published
 
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
in our fall annual hearing that showed
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
13.2 billion in the small state of New
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for Total Healthcare
 
01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:32.229 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for Total Healthcare
expenditures

01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
$933 per capita so if you're looking at
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
the marginal cost of compliance for
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
Price transparency at the insurer level
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
and at the hospital provider
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
level the marginal cost compared to the
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
absolute cost of$ 13.2 billion is
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
negligible so
 
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's a cost that I would be I'm a free
 
01:56:59.950 --> 01:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
market conservative person and think
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
much about incurrent cost that's
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
unnecessary had I thought that about
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
this I wouldn't have it in my heart to
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
be able to sit here in front of you nice
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
folks doing this great work and say that
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we should do this I would encourage
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise but so it's worth the cost
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
important representative Weber and then
 
01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:21.149 align:start position:0%
important representative Weber and then
representative

01:57:21.149 --> 01:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
Woods thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
my question and I I would very much like
 
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
a very short answer to this
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
um listening to you just now I am
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
remembering back that at the beginning
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
of the testimony you said you were
 
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
neutral and it sounded very much to me
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
by the time that you were finished
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
talking just recently you were far more
 
01:57:48.669 --> 01:57:48.679 align:start position:0%
positive than what I would consider
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
neutral given with the exception of your
 
01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:53.669 align:start position:0%
neutral given with the exception of your
point

01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
about divorcing the two different
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
components of the bill so are you in is
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
the department in fact neutral or do you
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
in fact think this is something we
 
01:58:05.950 --> 01:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
should go ahead with I'm neutral on this
 
01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill as it pertains to hospital entities
 
01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
for which the insurance department has
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
no authority over
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
so so followup well but you stated you
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
were neutral on the bill are is the
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
department supporting the other part of
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
the bill or is is the department neutral
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
on the other depart part of the bill the
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
the other the other part of this bill or
 
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
the how's Bill 705 I'm asking I'm just
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
trying all I'm trying to do is write
 
01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
down on my piece of paper in front of me
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
whether the department supports the bill
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
or doesn't support the bill and it
 
01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like you support one part of the
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
bill and do are neutral on the other I
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
just want to write it down the right way
 
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm not misrepresenting the
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
Department's position if you're neutral
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
on everything that's fine if you're
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
supporting part and not supporting part
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you representative
 
01:58:59.390 --> 01:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm just asking you to be clear
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
because I mentioned House Bill 705
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
that's in we that's an insurance
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
department Bill we spon we encourage the
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
legislator to sponsor this bill we're
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill with the one
 
01:59:12.750 --> 01:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
exception is the part about the
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
insurance I would I would suggest we
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
censor that from this
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
given that it's probably
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
not in the appropriate statute it might
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
better be served to be communicated in
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 705 which indeed it is it's
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
it sits redundantly in this Bill thank
 
01:59:36.430 --> 01:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
Woods thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this is very
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
short but um given the complexity and
 
01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
the inroad that goes into almost every
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
aspect of Medical Care um how much of
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
this uh would be obviated if we had
 
01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:55.470 align:start position:0%
this uh would be obviated if we had
Single

01:59:55.470 --> 01:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
Payer that that's beyond the limits of
 
01:59:59.069 --> 01:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
my knowledge that's a thoughtful
 
02:00:01.629 --> 02:00:01.639 align:start position:0%
question but extends beyond the limits
 
02:00:04.069 --> 02:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
yeah other
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
questions see no other questions thank
 
02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
much no one else has signed up to
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
testify on hb7 743 FN does anyone else
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
wish to
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
testify seeing no one I am going to
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on this bill
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on HB 524 FN
 
02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
and recognize the prime sponsor
 
02:00:33.079 --> 02:00:41.750 align:start position:0%
and recognize the prime sponsor
representative

02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
Granger uh thank you Mr chair and uh
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm going to be
 
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
introducing this with uh Laura here you
 
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
should have her pin card up there as
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
well this bill repeals the vaccine
 
02:00:55.149 --> 02:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
Association and the primary reason to do
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
that is to save a large amount of money
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
um because right now uh the state is
 
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of money on this vaccine
 
02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
Association for alleged cost savings
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
that aren't actually there and uh
 
02:01:11.229 --> 02:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
therefore I will turn it over to Laura
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
who has been on the board of the vaccine
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
Association in the past and can speak
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
much more fluently on it than I
 
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman McDonald and
 
02:01:30.069 --> 02:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
committee members I support this bill I
 
02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
do not believe that DHHS should be in

02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
support repeal the law that created this
 
02:01:46.270 --> 02:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
costly and unnecessary
 
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
Association it is best to remove
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
government from involvement in the
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
purchase of medical products when
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
Private Business does quite well and
 
02:01:57.390 --> 02:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
cost effectively for vaccines for adults
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
in fact the legislature rejected a bill
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
not too long ago as too costly
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary growth of government that
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
would have swept in the purchase of
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
adult vaccines into this program it is
 
02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
especially timely at this time of
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
significant budget crisis that
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
legislators support the governor and
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
look to programs that are costing
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars that can be better done
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
by Private
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
Industry it's time to shrink unnecessary
 
02:02:26.109 --> 02:02:26.119 align:start position:0%

since
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
2011 I work to educate the public on

vaccine policy and law and advocate for
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
informed voluntary consent I have
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%

Association board meetings for probably
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
about 15 years in June of 2014 I was
 
02:02:51.310 --> 02:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Senate president to
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
serve as a public member on the board a
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
position I served in for 5 years I have
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
remained a committed attendee and active
 
02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
commentator at all board meetings during
 
02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
my time on the board I worked on the
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
board to adopt Common Sense best
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
practices and push for greater
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
transparency and disclosure to the
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
public with regard to vaccine purchases
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
and practices of DHHS in this
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
Association I had some successes but in
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
recent years have found that DHHS and
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
the board have not only backtracked on
 
02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
those measures but are now actively
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
withholding information from the public
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
about this program their practices and
 
02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
expenditures I was actually bound from
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
the board in
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
2019 in replace by an industry Insider a
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
Right Aid pharmacist um hardly
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
represented of the public interests you
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
know someone is up to no good when they
 
02:03:44.189 --> 02:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
work extra hard to avoid transparency
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
and disclosure any quasi government
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
Association that seeks to shut out the
 
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
public from truthful and proper
 
02:03:52.189 --> 02:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
disclosure of policies and spending
 
02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
deserves to be eliminated you know
 
02:03:57.390 --> 02:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
someone is up to no good when they work
 
02:04:01.149 --> 02:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
extra hard to avoid transparency and
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
disclosure why do we even have this
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association in 2002 RSA 126 Q
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
became law based on the false premise
 
02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
that government can do this cheaper than
 
02:04:15.069 --> 02:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
Private Industry it was based on the
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
false representation that vaccines
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
purchased through the CDC and the
 
02:04:21.390 --> 02:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
federal vaccines for children contract
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
was a savings on vaccines compared to
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
market pricing but market pricing is
 
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
just like manufactured suggest a reeal
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
price on a car no one is actually paying
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
that price in fact vaccine providers in
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire all purchase vaccines for
 
02:04:40.549 --> 02:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
adults through very costeffective group
 
02:04:42.549 --> 02:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
purchasing organizations and
 
02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
manufactured discount programs without
 
02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
the unnecessary cost of government
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
involvement saving up to 60% depending
 
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
on the vaccine in interestingly at the
 
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
same time this original legislation was
 
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
being passed a new private business was
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
created to offer administrative services
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
to run this Association and was awarded
 
02:05:05.229 --> 02:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
a multi-year no bid contract that
 
02:05:08.350 --> 02:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
repeated for 16 years this private
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
business worked to pass similar
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
legislation in five other states where
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
it also secured the contract for
 
02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
administrative Services Beyond this and
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
a study was done that shows other states
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
have looked into this model and have
 
02:05:23.709 --> 02:05:23.719 align:start position:0%
rejected it soundly as unnecessarily and
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
too costly so what will this bill do
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot I've seen the
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
comments online a lot of confusion about
 
02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
what this Association is and what this
 
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
bill will do and won't do what it will
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
do it will save money by removing
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
government employees and cost from the
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
ordering purchasing distribution
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
marketing and monitoring of vaccines
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
purchase for commercially insured
 
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
children the New Hampshire vaccine
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
Association will claim their
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are a small
 
02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of the cost of vaccine
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
purchases and that's true um but that
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
claim completely ignores the staff at
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
DHHS involved on this board working to
 
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
purchase distribute and monitor this
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
state vaccine inventory doing site
 
02:06:08.189 --> 02:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
visits at doctor's offices that sort of
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
thing how many employees and how much
 
02:06:12.990 --> 02:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
cost well that's hard to know but
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
certainly you should be offended by the
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that's attached to this bill
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
because it fails to disclose those
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
obvious savings instead make makes two
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
absurd Claims One absurd claim is that a
 
02:06:29.069 --> 02:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
part-time staffer would need to be hired
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
to tell providers you're getting
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
vaccines in a different through a
 
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
different process you'll purchase your
 
02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
own instead of using one of the many
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
employees they will no longer need so
 
02:06:41.069 --> 02:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
it's absurd they would be hiring
 
02:06:43.069 --> 02:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
additional people by eliminating this
 
02:06:45.549 --> 02:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
program the second false claim and the
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal know is that there is an there
 
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
are additional General funds would be
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
needed um to be build um Health insurers
 
02:06:56.549 --> 02:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
would be needed excuse me to purchase
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines during a Public Health crisis
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh outbreaks or disaster relief effort
 
02:07:04.030 --> 02:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
if DHHS has been billing Health insurers
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
for that now they are violating state
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
law as they have no authority to Bill
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
insurers for those government use
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines for the vaccine
 
02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
Association but then DHHS vaccine
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
program has never been audited it is a
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
$40 million year vaccine purchase
 
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
program and there's been no audit and I
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
know that for certain because I might
 
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
made a 91a request to DHHS and I asked
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
for the most recent two years of audits
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
or their vaccine purchase program and I
 
02:07:34.109 --> 02:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
was informed there's never been an audit
 
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccine Association does their own
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
audit but that's just money going in and
 
02:07:40.589 --> 02:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
out it does not tell us about the
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
purchase of
 
02:07:45.149 --> 02:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
vaccines it will it will the claim is it
 
02:07:47.229 --> 02:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
will put the purchase of child vaccines
 
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
back in oh it will um put the purchase
 
02:07:51.629 --> 02:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
of child vaccines back in the hands of
 
02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
private providers just like they
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
purchase vaccines for adults quite
 
02:07:58.109 --> 02:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
effectively and efficiently it will
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
reduce waste Fraud and Abuse many
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines can be used for children or
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
adults there is no control over who
 
02:08:08.109 --> 02:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
providers are using these vaccines for
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
they've got a
 
02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
refrigerator please stop wrapping up
 
02:08:15.069 --> 02:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
okay um taxpayers will save millions of
 
02:08:17.229 --> 02:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
dollars for reductions in staff at
 
02:08:20.109 --> 02:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
DHS what it won't do some people think
 
02:08:22.109 --> 02:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
that it's going to remove requirements
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
it does not it does not make vaccines
 
02:08:26.189 --> 02:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
harder to get it does not make vaccines
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
more expensive it does not eliminate
 
02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines for poor children that's the
 
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine for children program entirely
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
separate it won't suddenly require costs
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
of deductibles and co-pays federal law
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
prohibits that vaccines still will be
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
free for any parent who want them for
 
02:08:46.589 --> 02:08:46.599 align:start position:0%
their children um this bill does not
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
take a position on the benefits of Merit
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines it's um it is is simply a long
 
02:08:56.589 --> 02:08:56.599 align:start position:0%
overdue Bill removing uh what should be
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
a private function the purchase of
 
02:09:00.750 --> 02:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
medical products from government and
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
shifting that back to Private Industry I
 
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
ask that you vote to pass thank this
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
bill please any
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative palaza and then
 
02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:11.870 align:start position:0%
questions representative palaza and then
representative

02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you uh Mr chair and uh thank
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um could you uh
 
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
am I correct in understanding that Most
 
02:09:26.430 --> 02:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
states don't have this body similar to
 
02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
Association that that is correct um it
 
02:09:34.750 --> 02:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
was initially created in New Hampshire
 
02:09:37.149 --> 02:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
and then the the fellow who created the
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
business to offer his administrative
 
02:09:42.669 --> 02:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
Services he got a no big contract that
 
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
that continued for this he went on to
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
other states five other states and
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed there and
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
interestingly he secured the
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
administrative contracts in those States
 
02:09:56.189 --> 02:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
as well so I'm I'm not sure who this
 
02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
Association is
 
02:10:01.149 --> 02:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
serving representor
 
02:10:03.069 --> 02:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you you touched
 
02:10:07.549 --> 02:10:07.559 align:start position:0%
upon this you know tangent but let's
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
just say we don't need the vaccine
 
02:10:13.229 --> 02:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
Association for you know General ronal
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
the mill but let's say there's a zombie
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
apocalypse I won't use covid because
 
02:10:19.229 --> 02:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
that's too political but let's say
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
there's a zombie apocalypse and there's
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
a a vaccine that comes and we really got
 
02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
to distribute this quickly and
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
efficiently um how do you see that
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
happening in the absence of the vaccine
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
Association simply the the way that they
 
02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
would purchase any other routine
 
02:10:43.470 --> 02:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinations you know once it's
 
02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
commercially available they can purchase
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
it with regard to covid it took some
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
time before it was commercially
 
02:10:52.350 --> 02:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
available so all the covid shots were
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
being purchased with federal dollars um
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
by the federal government and supply to
 
02:11:00.510 --> 02:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
the state so um if it was that sort of
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
thing I think it would go through that
 
02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
same scenario and and no money goes to
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
this Association in that scenario if it
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
was similar to co interesting that you
 
02:11:10.750 --> 02:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want to touch on the covid shots
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
but since you brought them up I will
 
02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
touch on those I did raise the question
 
02:11:17.229 --> 02:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
of why the vaccine Association is um
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursing DHHS for the purchase of
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
covid shots because under the definition
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
of vaccines in their very own statute
 
02:11:28.229 --> 02:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
126q the $3.6 million they spend on
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
those does not they do not qualify as
 
02:11:32.549 --> 02:11:32.559 align:start position:0%
vaccines under the definition in their
 
02:11:32.559 --> 02:11:34.350 align:start position:0%
vaccines under the definition in their
own

02:11:34.350 --> 02:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
statute other
 
02:11:38.830 --> 02:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you there oh sorry representative
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
kof fall uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so you
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
know one of the criticisms that I've
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
heard and I don't think I heard it in
 
02:11:53.709 --> 02:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
your testimony was around um audit um
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
and sort of to what extent has the
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association been
 
02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:59.470 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association been
audited

02:11:59.470 --> 02:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
audited
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
um I so i' I've I've heard that and yet
 
02:12:04.030 --> 02:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
I've also heard that they have an audit
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm just trying to get
 
02:12:08.189 --> 02:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
clarification on if you're familiar with
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
that what what does it mean yes having
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
you know attended all their board
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
meetings and serve for five years as a
 
02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
public member yes the vaccine
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
Association is audited I've I've
 
02:12:20.589 --> 02:12:20.599 align:start position:0%
reviewed that audit um so they are
 
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
audited year but that is simply did we
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
provide um the money to DHHS that we
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
collected and that they ask for what it
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
does not do is it does not audit that
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
$40 million annual purchase of vaccines
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
by DHHS are they purchasing and
 
02:12:42.990 --> 02:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
requesting for reimbursement from the
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
association vaccine products that are
 
02:12:47.790 --> 02:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
qualify as vaccines are they actually
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
Distributing those there's there's no
 
02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
audit zero oversight on that there is a
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
second report that the vaccine
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
Association provides to the legislature
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
that's called their annual report it's
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
generally a two or three page document
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's really a marketing um brochure
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh put out by DHHS and large part of it
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's a letter from DHHS so kind of a a
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
poor report of anything that's
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
material any other questions
 
02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:19.510 align:start position:0%
material any other questions
representative

02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
Drew uh thank you Mr
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
chairman my question is this I I read
 
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
through the statute on this and it very
 
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
much seems that this
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
is for all intents and purposes a tax
 
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
and it's a tax that's set by the vaccine
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
Association assessed from insurance
 
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
companies who essentially have no choice
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
because if they don't pay they lose
 
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
their license and then it's handed over
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
to DHHS for the purchase of something is
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
that an accurate assessment of how this
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
program operates um you you could call
 
02:13:57.149 --> 02:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
it a tax I mean obviously it's it's it's
 
02:13:59.549 --> 02:13:59.559 align:start position:0%
called an assessment but you know I'm
 
02:14:01.390 --> 02:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
glad that you you raised that because
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
one of the the other concerns is um the
 
02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
entire cost of this vaccine Association
 
02:14:10.030 --> 02:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
including administrative costs legal
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
fees is being written off as Medical
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
Loss and that the statute allows them to
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
do that so those administrative costs
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
with any other company um the federal
 
02:14:22.549 --> 02:14:22.559 align:start position:0%
government requires those administrative
 
02:14:25.629 --> 02:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
costs be separate and they're limited to
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
15 or 20% of Premium costs anything
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
above that is refunded to Consumers so
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
this artificially increases health
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums to Consumers unfairly
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
that um they they shouldn't be paying
 
02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
those administrative costs as if they
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
were Medical Loss other question I hope
 
02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:44.669 align:start position:0%
were Medical Loss other question I hope
that's

02:14:44.669 --> 02:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
helpful seeing no other questions thank
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:58.750 --> 02:14:58.760 align:start position:0%

I'm a registered nurse here in New
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and my position is strongly
 
02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:22.559 align:start position:0%
about preserving access to care and

maintaining costeffective care and
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
thereby I am opposed to this bill in a
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
former role as a school nurse I have
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
seen firsthand the critical importance
 
02:15:34.510 --> 02:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
of vaccination in ensuring children can
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
safely attend school vaccines protect
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
children from dangerous diseases and
 
02:15:43.109 --> 02:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
historical outbreaks such as polio
 
02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
highlight just how devastating these
 
02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
diseases can be more recently we've seen
 
02:15:50.109 --> 02:15:50.119 align:start position:0%
an uptick in measles outbreaks which
 
02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
underscore the ongoing risk of vaccine
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases when New Hampshire
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
families have access to immunizations
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
our entire state benefits creating a
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
healthier and safer Community for
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
everyone that's why I am deeply
 
02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about House Bill 524 which
 
02:16:09.149 --> 02:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
threatens to dismantle our state's
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
children's vaccine program right now New
 
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's immunization system is
 
02:16:17.549 --> 02:16:17.559 align:start position:0%
designed to be efficient and cost
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
effective insurance companies contribute
 
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
to a central f fund that is managed by
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
which allows the state to purchase
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines at a 30% discount these
 
02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines are then provided to families
 
02:16:32.990 --> 02:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
at no
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
costs hostel 524 however would eliminate
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
the vaccine Association forcing doctors
 
02:16:42.349 --> 02:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
offices to manage their own vaccine
 
02:16:44.509 --> 02:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
inventories in Bill insurance companies
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
at full
 
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
price this would likely mean higher
 
02:16:50.110 --> 02:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket costs for families
 
02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
including C pays and co- insurance and
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
added administrative burdens of doctor's
 
02:16:58.429 --> 02:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
offices this bill would create
 
02:16:58.439 --> 02:16:59.990 align:start position:0%
offices this bill would create
unnecessarily

02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
unnecessary cost barriers for both
 
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
families and health care providers
 
02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
making it harder for children to receive
 
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
the vaccines they need to stay safe and
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
healthy in school at a time when vaccine
 
02:17:15.389 --> 02:17:15.399 align:start position:0%
hesitancy is increasing and compliance
 
02:17:17.709 --> 02:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
in school vaccine requirements are
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
decreasing New Hampshire needs the
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association to avoid any
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
contribution to these Trends we must
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
preserve our state's immunization
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
program to ensure that every child has
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
access to vaccines without Financial
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
hurdles thank you so much for your time
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I know you have to leave are
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
you taking questions or I'd be happy to
 
02:17:42.030 --> 02:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
take questions any questions for Carla
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
Smith yes representative palazov thank
 
02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:17:52.750 --> 02:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
question uh you you mentioned uh poo uh
 
02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:54.549 align:start position:0%
question uh you you mentioned uh poo uh
elimination

02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
elimination
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
so um given uh it was probably a long
 
02:17:57.840 --> 02:17:58.830 align:start position:0%
so um given uh it was probably a long
time

02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
ago uh am I correct in assuming that New
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association had no
 
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
role in it and what was there any
 
02:18:12.270 --> 02:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
disease that was eliminated since we had
 
02:18:14.349 --> 02:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
Association no um I use that as an
 
02:18:19.950 --> 02:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
example I think childhood immunization
 
02:18:22.190 --> 02:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for schools is very very
 
02:18:24.509 --> 02:18:24.519 align:start position:0%
important and it's near to dear to me um
 
02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
in my experiences being a school nurse
 
02:18:28.589 --> 02:18:28.599 align:start position:0%
I've been very fortunate I've never seen
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
a child with polio I truly hope I never
 
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
see a child with polio I hope all of you
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
in this room never have that happen
 
02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:36.950 align:start position:0%
in this room never have that happen
diseases

02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
02:18:40.030 --> 02:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
reemerge when vaccine vaccine rates go
 
02:18:42.429 --> 02:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
down and we're really seeing a trend
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
right now in measles um and I think we
 
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
have to make this about accessibility to
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
care this is not a debate or bill that's
 
02:18:53.549 --> 02:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
about whether to vaccinate or not it's
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
not about what to require in schools
 
02:18:57.070 --> 02:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
those we've had those bills I'm sure
 
02:18:58.509 --> 02:18:58.519 align:start position:0%
more of those are coming up again they
 
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
always do it's like round hog
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
dayve sorry about that um but this is
 
02:19:09.629 --> 02:19:09.639 align:start position:0%
about this is a cost efficient mechanism
 
02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
to make vaccines available and I do not
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
want to see that go
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
away other
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.309 --> 02:19:27.319 align:start position:0%

Services they'll structure okay you want
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
to go later on the okay are we talking
 
02:19:58.590 --> 02:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:00.910 --> 02:20:00.920 align:start position:0%

vaccine Association um currently we are
 
02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
524 uh for those of you who are not
 
02:20:17.070 --> 02:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with the purpose or the work of
 
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
the association it is a not for-profit
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
independent 501c3 voluntary corporation
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
that was formed under RSA 292 and
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
created by State Statute 23 years ago
 
02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
the association was initially
 
02:20:32.190 --> 02:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
established for the convenience of
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
Health insurers and third-party
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%

enable provider practice locations to
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
have access to all vaccines at no cost
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
to them or to patients New Hampshire was
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
the first of 14 states to create
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
Universal vaccine purchase programs
 
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
additionally all 50 states and
 
02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
territories have programs supporting
 
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:09.000 align:start position:0%

in the state's uvp the association

itself does not purchase
 
02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:21.160 align:start position:0%

Representatives of payers providers and

of both nhid and
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS I just want to take a minute to
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
explain the mechanics of the program um
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
they're quite
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward um in August of each
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
year the association receives an annual
 
02:21:59.790 --> 02:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
estimated invoice of the funds it needs
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
from the association to fund the program
 
02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
in September we calculate the rate that
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies will pay and
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
approve that and then four times a year
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
we collect money from the insurance
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
companies and then in June we had a
 
02:22:16.349 --> 02:22:16.359 align:start position:0%
final invoice that's been Tred up from
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
the department and we remit a check at
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
day this pass through funding mechanism
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
helped support the Department of Health
 
02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
and Human Services in their ability to
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
provide these free vaccines to healthc
 
02:22:29.469 --> 02:22:29.479 align:start position:0%
care providers whether the patient is
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
privately insured has Medicaid
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
Etc it is expected to save about 30% on
 
02:22:37.270 --> 02:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
childhood immunization purchases this
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
coming year and has total administrative
 
02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
costs of less than 1% which are born
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
100% by the payers not the state and to
 
02:22:47.790 --> 02:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
put this in perspective we spent
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
$154,000 last year on Administration on
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
a program that had $18.3 million
 
02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
attached to it I really challenge
 
02:22:56.990 --> 02:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
anybody to find something that is
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
running more efficiently than the
 
02:23:01.710 --> 02:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association at
 
02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
84% we do have accountability in
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
multiple areas we have reporting
 
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and statute to the governor
 
02:23:09.870 --> 02:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate President Speaker of the
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
House the commissioners of DHHS and nhid
 
02:23:15.150 --> 02:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
these reports are public on our website
 
02:23:16.910 --> 02:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
we have an annual report an annual
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
Financial audit and we have uh five
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
board and three committee meetings each
 
02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
year that are held online and open to
 
02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:23.750 align:start position:0%
year that are held online and open to
the

02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
public we're fundamentally opposed to
 
02:23:28.830 --> 02:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
this as it has met and currently meets
 
02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
its established attent of ensuring
 
02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
stable and Equitable contributions from
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
payers to the state's
 
02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
uvp Additionally the association saves
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
administrative billing costs for payers
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
and providers by eliminating them it
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
saves cost on immunizations and that
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
acrs to the payers employers and
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately consumers it allows providers
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
to avoid the burden of inventory
 
02:23:52.670 --> 02:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
carrying costs in the case of one
 
02:23:55.630 --> 02:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
immunization for RSV providers would
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
need to front $4,500 just to be able to
 
02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
offer a single dose of the immunization
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
if you could start wrapping up Sir Y and
 
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
then ultimately it allows providers to
 
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
offer these no cost vaccines in summary
 
02:24:09.550 --> 02:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
this pass through mechanism has been
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
working well for nearly a quarter of a
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
century as the addage says if it's not
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
broken don't fix it I really thank you
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to present this
 
02:24:20.670 --> 02:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to answer any questions
 
02:24:22.750 --> 02:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
if there's any regulatory questions uh
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
the association's outside council is
 
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
here today and my contact information is
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
enclosed thank you thank you
 
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr chair
 
02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question this is
 
02:24:37.269 --> 02:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
kind of a crystal ball type question but
 
02:24:40.429 --> 02:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
um if you cease to exist as this bill
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
passed um and as the first I'm sorry I
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't remember names well the first
 
02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
person who testified suggest that this
 
02:24:48.269 --> 02:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
could be handled better privatized um
 
02:24:51.150 --> 02:24:51.160 align:start position:0%
what do you envision would happen to the
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
provision of I think what will happen is
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
the state could continue to participate
 
02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
in the childhood for vaccine program for
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid children and then on the
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
commercial side providers would have to
 
02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
decide whether one they could afford to
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
purchase and stock the vaccines they'd
 
02:25:06.830 --> 02:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
then have to go through the
 
02:25:09.469 --> 02:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
administrative billing practices if they
 
02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
did choose to stay and and offer them
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
they would then have to um build the
 
02:25:16.429 --> 02:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
carriers get money back from the
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
carriers and move forward and what I've
 
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
heard and I believe there's people here
 
02:25:21.630 --> 02:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
to today that we'll talk to this more
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
specifically whether it's a federally
 
02:25:25.870 --> 02:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Center or even large uh
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
medical centers that whole process is
 
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
extremely costly for them especially the
 
02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
carrying cost of the vaccines and I
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
think we've all listening to the prior
 
02:25:37.870 --> 02:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
Bill heard about medical billing and and
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
what that entails so this really
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
eliminates all of that thank you one
 
02:25:44.030 --> 02:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
more thing not all childhood vaccines
 
02:25:46.830 --> 02:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
can also be given in retail say Pharmacy
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
locations and so I think that's another
 
02:25:51.870 --> 02:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
another issue that would be
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
faced representative
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
lamon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question have any of your
 
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
um member providers pediatric practices
 
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
asked to not participate and buy their
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines on the free market I will defer
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
that to the health department because
 
02:26:12.269 --> 02:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
they actually manage the provider
 
02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
relationships our job is really to
 
02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
collect funds from the insurance
 
02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
companies and remit that back to the
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
department but as as far as I know no
 
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
but I when they come up I think it'd be
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
great to ask them thank you
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative u u
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
palaza thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question sure um so there
 
02:26:38.429 --> 02:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
was a a question about uh U assessment
 
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh um whether it function like uh
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
attacks so could you confirm that uh if
 
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh Insurance uh uh some
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
company uh is not paying into it uh they
 
02:26:56.910 --> 02:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
will lose their
 
02:26:58.830 --> 02:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
license um I would have to have somebody
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department you know
 
02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
respond to the license they are required
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
126q uh both fully insured plans as well
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
as self-funded plans which are typically
 
02:27:11.309 --> 02:27:11.319 align:start position:0%
through the third party administrators
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
or some of the larger carriers to
 
02:27:15.309 --> 02:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
participate um again when the program
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
was put together uh it initially was
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
based on uh some voluntary funding back
 
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
in the early '90s and then everybody
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
figured with more companies coming to
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state it made sense to standardize
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
this to make it Equitable across all
 
02:27:30.030 --> 02:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
carriers uh and later additional things
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
were changed in the program to continue
 
02:27:34.110 --> 02:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
that such as it's only on child assessed
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
lives it doesn't include adults as an
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
example so um right now it's based upon
 
02:27:43.269 --> 02:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
statute other
 
02:27:46.349 --> 02:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lucas thank you
 
02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
question um there's crystal ball
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
question if I may um in the absence of
 
02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:55.550 align:start position:0%
question if I may um in the absence of
the

02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
association and in private practices
 
02:28:01.389 --> 02:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
that decide that they cannot afford the
 
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
cost of carrying the
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
vaccines where do the patients go if
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
they choose to have the vaccines right
 
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
so currently there is no plan for that
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
because we've got so many practices that
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
do participate in other outlets for them
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
um potentially it would disrupt the
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
relationship between the pediatrician
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the patient because i''d have to go
 
02:28:26.269 --> 02:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere else to find the vaccine um
 
02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that from a um from
 
02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
sort of a cost perspective as well
 
02:28:33.870 --> 02:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
whether it may be you know travel to as
 
02:28:35.309 --> 02:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
well as just a general disruption like
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
it would create a lot of problems and
 
02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing some folks today will also
 
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
talk to that specifically that are
 
02:28:42.790 --> 02:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
providers but there's there's no other
 
02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
place to go currently and especially
 
02:28:46.590 --> 02:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
because of the age you can't just walk
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
into a pharmacy and vaccinate your child
 
02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the requirements thank you yes uh
 
02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
other questions represent uh
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative Woods did you have okay
 
02:29:00.670 --> 02:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative palaza thank you Mr chair
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my other
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
question yes so could you talk about
 
02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
other states so there was some
 
02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
conflicting uh numbers today uh first I
 
02:29:13.269 --> 02:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
heard uh about five states have similar
 
02:29:18.030 --> 02:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
programs and uh you told 14 or 15 uh so
 
02:29:20.349 --> 02:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
if you could help with how different
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
states do it and if we see different
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
results comparing to uh other 35 or so
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
States who don't have a centralized uh
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
purchase program sure so the um
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
Association of immunization managers
 
02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
does publish a map of the country and
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
which states have these programs and
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
again the fully Universal states which
 
02:29:44.269 --> 02:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
means you've got private money and uh
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
money from the federal government
 
02:29:47.950 --> 02:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
involved there are 14 of those States
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
currently um and so I'm sure that could
 
02:29:53.269 --> 02:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
be provided to you if you'd like to take
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
take a look at that and I apologize I
 
02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
forget the second part of your
 
02:30:00.150 --> 02:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
question uh so if you could compare
 
02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
those 14 states with program with uh
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
states without program do we see any
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
differences in cost and immunization
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
rates or anything I know there are wide
 
02:30:13.710 --> 02:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
variations across the country in terms
 
02:30:15.309 --> 02:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
of immunization rates I'm not an
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist so I think I would defer
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
that question to the department if that
 
02:30:21.550 --> 02:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
would be okay with the committee
 
02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Nagel thank
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
question sure you're I don't want you to
 
02:30:30.990 --> 02:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
give me the entire budget but um the the
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
money youve taken where does all that
 
02:30:35.710 --> 02:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
come from so the money that we receive
 
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
um comes from individual insurance
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
companies and third party administrators
 
02:30:42.910 --> 02:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
so they're currently 91 that pay into
 
02:30:44.670 --> 02:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
the program and that number fluctuates
 
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
it goes up and down as carriers come in
 
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
and out of the state and have uh
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
pediatric patients
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
um and so what happens is on a quarterly
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
basis um each one of those child covered
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
lives that each carrier has gets
 
02:31:02.269 --> 02:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
assessed and uh funds are brought into
 
02:31:04.429 --> 02:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
the association and then we write
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
essentially one large check to the state
 
02:31:09.150 --> 02:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year and can I ask
 
02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
follow up so why is there such a large
 
02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
savings listed on the fiscal note to the
 
02:31:16.750 --> 02:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
state that's what confuses me I will
 
02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
have the state respond to the fiscal
 
02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
note because that's a that's something
 
02:31:23.469 --> 02:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
that they wrote that's
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
 
02:31:28.429 --> 02:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
else seeing no one okay thank you okay
 
02:31:35.070 --> 02:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Kim
 
02:31:39.389 --> 02:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
Bernard from the nashille division of
 
02:31:49.950 --> 02:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:59.670 --> 02:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
I uh if Mr Bernard I've already called
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
Mr Bernard but if uh he's willing to
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:16.590 --> 02:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
yeah as you can see there's quite a few
 
02:32:18.510 --> 02:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%

02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
back on schedule so yeah without that
 
02:32:41.349 --> 02:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
you please proceed okay thank you thank
 
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
you for hearing my testimony my name is
 
02:32:44.910 --> 02:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
Dr Christine arnow I'm a pediatrician
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
here in conquered I'm the vice president
 
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire chapter of the
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics and I'm
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
also a mother of three I think that um
 
02:32:57.630 --> 02:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
the um I am here to ask you to oppose
 
02:33:00.389 --> 02:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
house built 524 I think that what the
 
02:33:02.429 --> 02:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine Association does
 
02:33:06.309 --> 02:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
has been well outlined it saves money by
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
having a group purchase for vaccines and
 
02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
then having those vaccines distributed
 
02:33:11.359 --> 02:33:12.309 align:start position:0%
then having those vaccines distributed
to

02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
practices um if this bill were to pass
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
pediatric practices would have to buy
 
02:33:18.990 --> 02:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines and charge patient insurances
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
for them as been described this gives
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies power
 
02:33:25.469 --> 02:33:25.479 align:start position:0%
essentially to
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
charge theoretically whatever they want
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
for those vaccines and for that cost to
 
02:33:34.030 --> 02:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
theoretically be put back on the patient
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
right now these vaccines are given to
 
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
patients completely free of
 
02:33:41.710 --> 02:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
charge um one thing I wanted to speak to
 
02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
is that the process of vaccine
 
02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
management is appropriately very heavily
 
02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
regimented we have you know a
 
02:33:49.269 --> 02:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
refrigerator that has to be kept at a
 
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
certain temperature certain humidity we
 
02:33:54.030 --> 02:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
have I work for a small Private Practice
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
here in town and we have um a employee
 
02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
who works 20 hours a week just on
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine management
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
ordering communicating um with the state
 
02:34:08.110 --> 02:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
database and that's just for our small
 
02:34:13.150 --> 02:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
practice that is a mere you know small
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
fraction of the the number of kids in
 
02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
the state getting vaccines
 
02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
um the author of the bill estimate that
 
02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
it would take a single part-time state
 
02:34:22.439 --> 02:34:23.870 align:start position:0%
it would take a single part-time state
employee

02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
to work work out this transition based
 
02:34:30.910 --> 02:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
on my experience this is a gross
 
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
underestimate um this bill would require
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
the staff support of multiple employees
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps a whole team which would be very
 
02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
costly during that transition as um the
 
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
individual from the New Hampshire
 
02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association mentioned the system
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
we have works very well it allows us to
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
give kids who want vaccines vaccines at
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
no cost to those
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
families and for this reason um house
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
bille house bill 524 asked the state to
 
02:35:01.110 --> 02:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
spend money to create a problem the
 
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
authors of this bill agree that it will
 
02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
cost the state more money we disagree
 
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
exactly how much um but I believe that
 
02:35:08.510 --> 02:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
it would be far far more than they
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
anticipate and anyone who works in a
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
medical office knows that it will hurt
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
pediatric practices and patience um for
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
this reason I urge you to please oppose
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:35:20.429 --> 02:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
524 and I should mention I speaking on
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%

02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
that all children under the age of 19
 
02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
can be vaccinated at no
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
cost why would we want to change
 
02:36:42.990 --> 02:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
this why would we want to make it harder
 
02:36:45.990 --> 02:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
for parents to keep their children
 
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
healthy we do not have this Equity with
 
02:36:50.830 --> 02:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
adult vaccines and we see the challenges
 
02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:51.950 align:start position:0%
adult vaccines and we see the challenges
it

02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:36:54.510 --> 02:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
causes without the New Hampshire vaccine
 
02:36:57.550 --> 02:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
Association program increased barriers
 
02:36:59.830 --> 02:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
may keep children from becoming
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinated which also opens up children
 
02:37:05.469 --> 02:37:05.479 align:start position:0%
to diseases that are
 
02:37:09.790 --> 02:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
preventable and in turn increases cost
 
02:37:12.190 --> 02:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
state for example there are actual
 
02:37:17.790 --> 02:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
scenarios of access barriers we have
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
assisted with in our work as public
 
02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
Public Health nurses and here are a
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
few we cared for a 2-year-old boy in our
 
02:37:27.309 --> 02:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
Clinic who needed a hepatitis A vaccine
 
02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
because his provider does not carry
 
02:37:32.349 --> 02:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
it we've assisted a mom who brought her
 
02:37:34.830 --> 02:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
one-year-old baby to our Clinic to
 
02:37:36.990 --> 02:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
receive the covid vaccine because his
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
provider did not carry
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
it we we um served a family with six
 
02:37:46.150 --> 02:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
children who wanted to space out their
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines we worked with this
 
02:37:51.870 --> 02:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
family and it's very challenging for a
 
02:37:54.030 --> 02:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
practice to do
 
02:37:57.309 --> 02:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
that in terms of flu vaccines it's
 
02:37:59.030 --> 02:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes difficult for busy working
 
02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
families to get a visit at their
 
02:38:00.399 --> 02:38:01.790 align:start position:0%
families to get a visit at their
provider's

02:38:01.790 --> 02:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
provider's
 
02:38:04.870 --> 02:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
office we assisted an 18-year-old going
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
to college who needed their menitis
 
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine to complete College admission
 
02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
paperwork we also recently cared for an
 
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
18-year-old who was never vaccinated and
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
now he is making an educated decision to
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:23.389 --> 02:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
we also often see kids who need routine
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines for the school year but could
 
02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
not get an appointment at their
 
02:38:28.830 --> 02:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
provider's office due to challenges with
 
02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:30.950 align:start position:0%
provider's office due to challenges with
limited

02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
limited
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce as public health professionals
 
02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
our core role includes protecting and
 
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
promoting the health of our
 
02:38:41.790 --> 02:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
community a key factor in facilitating
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
this is through
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
prevention as leaders in our community
 
02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
we need to do better to decrease
 
02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
barriers to health care for all people
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
as well as keep costs down in our
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
state I sincerely appreciate the
 
02:38:59.230 --> 02:38:59.240 align:start position:0%

the bureau I'm the bureau chief for the
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau of infectious disease within the
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health services
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Health and
 
02:39:55.230 --> 02:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
Human Services and today I'm joined by
 
02:39:57.630 --> 02:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
an Mercury anarie Mercury who is our
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
immunization Section Chief and we are
 
02:40:03.790 --> 02:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
here to oppose House Bill
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
524 we want to we want to Echo what you
 
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
have heard in previous testimony that we
 
02:40:11.790 --> 02:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
believe that the New Hampshire vaccine
 
02:40:14.950 --> 02:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
Association helps create the best access
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire families and children
 
02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
to access immun immunizations in our
 
02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:20.269 align:start position:0%
to access immun immunizations in our
state

02:40:20.269 --> 02:40:20.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:40:22.910 --> 02:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
we also want to Echo that it will it
 
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
does save money to insurers and group
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
health plans and also we want to Echo
 
02:40:32.230 --> 02:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
that because the department is integral
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
in vaccine management and education to
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers we we assist
 
02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers in minimizing waste
 
02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
which is a savings and efficient in
 
02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
establishes efficiencies with within
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
that provider practice
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
if House Bill 524 was enacted there
 
02:40:53.630 --> 02:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
would be an immediate impact to healthc
 
02:40:56.269 --> 02:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
care providers they would again have to
 
02:40:58.670 --> 02:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
as was expressed in previous testimony
 
02:41:02.110 --> 02:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
have to bear upfront cost for vaccine
 
02:41:04.990 --> 02:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
managing separate inventories of vaccine
 
02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
the department did provide a fiscal note
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
to this and I'm going to turn it to
 
02:41:11.469 --> 02:41:11.479 align:start position:0%
anarie to give more details on that
 
02:41:11.479 --> 02:41:14.150 align:start position:0%
anarie to give more details on that
fiscal

02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:16.349 align:start position:0%
 
note

02:41:16.349 --> 02:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
hello shove myself off sorry about that
 
02:41:20.950 --> 02:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you very much um
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share some information about
 
02:41:24.309 --> 02:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
the fiscal node and then I'd like to
 
02:41:26.030 --> 02:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
provide further details from the
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
Department because I think there's been
 
02:41:29.710 --> 02:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions that we um are able
 
02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
to answer so regarding the fiscal note
 
02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
um if this bill were to be enacted um
 
02:41:37.469 --> 02:41:37.479 align:start position:0%
the department would no longer be able
 
02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
to purchase vaccines for privately
 
02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
insured children so the fiscal note was
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
entered in for $150,000 for year one and
 
02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:46.230 align:start position:0%
entered in for $150,000 for year one and
then

02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
$100,000 each year um p pass that and
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
that is to prepare for an event of an
 
02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
outbreak um outbreaks can be extremely
 
02:41:57.870 --> 02:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
expensive for vaccination um when we are
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
looking at a vaccine of uh $25 per dose
 
02:42:04.230 --> 02:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
and we have to administer four to 5,000
 
02:42:07.990 --> 02:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
doses that comes to uh pretty close to
 
02:42:10.670 --> 02:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um so outbreaks are very very
 
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
expensive to control without the vaccine
 
02:42:14.429 --> 02:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
Association we would not have the
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
universal program and we would need some
 
02:42:18.910 --> 02:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
funds if the department were to be able
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
to to assist providers and um handle a
 
02:42:25.950 --> 02:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine outbreak um so I would like to
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
then move into additional uh details
 
02:42:30.110 --> 02:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
about how the department works with the
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association to answer some of
 
02:42:34.510 --> 02:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
the questions that have come up um about
 
02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
our role so the vaccine Association as
 
02:42:39.309 --> 02:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned it saves money it reduces the
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
provider burden and it ensures the
 
02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
universal access for all children um
 
02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
each year the department estimates the
 
02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
number and cost of the immuniz that will
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
be needed for children to cover the
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
entire child population of New Hampshire
 
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
we recognize that not every child will
 
02:42:59.150 --> 02:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated not every child will get
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated so our estimate is
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
based on the actual Doses and cost of
 
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that were purchased the
 
02:43:11.070 --> 02:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
prior year so we um have you know those
 
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
projections that we provide to the
 
02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:14.349 align:start position:0%
projections that we provide to the
vaccine

02:43:14.349 --> 02:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:43:18.429 --> 02:43:18.439 align:start position:0%
Association um we do have a uh cost
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
split between the federal vaccine for
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
children program they cover 40% to cover
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
the costs for vaccinating children who
 
02:43:30.590 --> 02:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
are Medicaid uninsured underinsured um
 
02:43:34.269 --> 02:43:34.279 align:start position:0%
American um Indian and Alaskan natives
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then the vaccine Association covers
 
02:43:39.469 --> 02:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
the non-vf eligible children which is
 
02:43:42.349 --> 02:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
primarily the commercially
 
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
insured so um what we want to do is to
 
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that the vaccine Association is
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
only reimbursing the department for the
 
02:43:53.950 --> 02:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
the cost of actual vaccines that are
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
administered so what we do is we have
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
very very tight controls of inventory
 
02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
and fiscal management um we are um
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring how much vacine is going out
 
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
to each of the providers and we actually
 
02:44:14.309 --> 02:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
apply a split funding per provider so we
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
collect data from the providers on an
 
02:44:19.389 --> 02:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
annual basis they report to us the
 
02:44:21.870 --> 02:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
numbers of vfc eligible children the
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
numbers of non-vf C eligible children
 
02:44:27.230 --> 02:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
that way we know that provider office
 
02:44:30.590 --> 02:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
has a specific percent split when a
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
provider places an order the department
 
02:44:35.110 --> 02:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
goes ahead and applies that percent
 
02:44:38.190 --> 02:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
split to that actual provider's office
 
02:44:41.269 --> 02:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
so in the case of an fqc federally
 
02:44:43.389 --> 02:44:43.399 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Care Center they may
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
have more Medicaid eligible children
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
than a provider who is in private
 
02:44:50.750 --> 02:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
practice we apply different splits based
 
02:44:53.630 --> 02:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
on their patient populations you ask for
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
four minutes so if you could start
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
wrapping up okay thank you um so we um
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
are VI Vigilant about controlling the
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
waste um how the cost savings comes into
 
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
play is we are a volume uh purchaser we
 
02:45:09.550 --> 02:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
purchased through the CDC contract which
 
02:45:12.269 --> 02:45:12.279 align:start position:0%
is a 27% cost savings as compared to
 
02:45:14.030 --> 02:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
private market we've talked to the
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturers manufacturers would
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
consider a 4 to 11% discount based on
 
02:45:22.110 --> 02:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
provider volume of vaccine purchase um
 
02:45:23.550 --> 02:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
but there's no way near that they're
 
02:45:26.309 --> 02:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
going to get um the savings that is um
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
afforded to the um insurers through this
 
02:45:32.030 --> 02:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
program um and I would be happy to
 
02:45:34.030 --> 02:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions because I do want
 
02:45:36.429 --> 02:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
to be respectful of your time thank you
 
02:45:40.750 --> 02:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
Weber sorry I I want to be sure that
 
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
I've got my uh gotten straight with the
 
02:45:52.429 --> 02:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal note because they they talk
 
02:45:55.670 --> 02:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
about $4 million decrease in in federal
 
02:45:59.309 --> 02:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
spend in in state spending but am I
 
02:46:02.030 --> 02:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
correct in reading this fiscal note as
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
there is an absolute wash because you
 
02:46:08.349 --> 02:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
have the 24 million that comes in and
 
02:46:11.950 --> 02:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
the 24 million that goes out
 
02:46:16.269 --> 02:46:16.279 align:start position:0%
so that is uh there there's no
 
02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
expenditure of General funds it's all
 
02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
the money in and the money out and then
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
distributed to each provider according
 
02:46:30.590 --> 02:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
to what they have told you in advance
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
that they need is that correct that that
 
02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
that is correct um the department does
 
02:46:37.070 --> 02:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
not have any Financial gains or losses
 
02:46:38.830 --> 02:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
it's um the expenditures and the
 
02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
revenues are an exact wash for the New
 
02:46:42.630 --> 02:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association we would
 
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
need those additional funds for outbreak
 
02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
control as mentioned right thank you
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you my friend for
 
02:46:54.389 --> 02:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
that clarification on a fiscal note I
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um I I still want to
 
02:46:58.950 --> 02:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
understand one thing though is this
 
02:47:00.990 --> 02:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
functionally a self-funded organization
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
or is there a state contribution to it
 
02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
and if so how much is
 
02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
that so there is not a state
 
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
contribution um we are uh funded through
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
um federal grants to operate the New
 
02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire immunization program and um
 
02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
because of that work our program and our
 
02:47:23.870 --> 02:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is in place um the
 
02:47:26.590 --> 02:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
additional costs of managing the vaccine
 
02:47:31.150 --> 02:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
Association is is fractional um we um do
 
02:47:36.630 --> 02:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
request uh six 60% of a few positions
 
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
because we are monitoring so much more
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
for the vaccine Association than we are
 
02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
monitoring for the vfc program um but we
 
02:47:48.190 --> 02:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
we do that in kind spirit because uh
 
02:47:50.030 --> 02:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
we're good steward W of the dollar we
 
02:47:52.950 --> 02:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
don't want any wastage uh we allow our
 
02:47:56.429 --> 02:47:56.439 align:start position:0%
providers to transfer vaccine from one
 
02:47:59.110 --> 02:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
another prior to expiration so that it's
 
02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
used we worked very closely with the
 
02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
providers uh we do not have them replace
 
02:48:08.110 --> 02:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
any vaccine for uh circumstances beyond
 
02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
their control so if there's a power
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
outage they're not responsible for
 
02:48:14.750 --> 02:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
replacing that that loss if the vaccine
 
02:48:16.269 --> 02:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
Association were repealed they would
 
02:48:18.910 --> 02:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
become responsible for that um so
 
02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
providers representative palazov thank
 
02:48:27.510 --> 02:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
question uh did I hear you correctly
 
02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
that your fiscal note assumes outbreaks
 
02:48:36.070 --> 02:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
every year and generally how many
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
outbreaks uh did we have in the last
 
02:48:42.429 --> 02:48:42.439 align:start position:0%
decade um so the fiscal note is to
 
02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that the funds are available in
 
02:48:46.469 --> 02:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
the event of an outbreak so those funds
 
02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
would not be used unless an outbreak
 
02:48:48.399 --> 02:48:49.710 align:start position:0%
would not be used unless an outbreak
occurred

02:48:49.710 --> 02:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
02:48:53.070 --> 02:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
um our last outbreak uh we were dealing
 
02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
with hepatitis A up until about
 
02:49:00.110 --> 02:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
2021 um we went ahead and gave thousands
 
02:49:04.110 --> 02:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
of doses of hepatitis A vaccine um so
 
02:49:08.429 --> 02:49:08.439 align:start position:0%
and also obviously the pandemic um but
 
02:49:11.429 --> 02:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
in general uh we do have low levels of
 
02:49:14.190 --> 02:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
outbreak because of our vaccine coverage
 
02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
if access becomes an issue fewer
 
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
children may get um may not have the
 
02:49:21.229 --> 02:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
option to get vaccinated when they
 
02:49:23.150 --> 02:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
choose to be vaccinated and they're
 
02:49:26.070 --> 02:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to be more likely to be
 
02:49:28.910 --> 02:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
susceptible other
 
02:49:32.229 --> 02:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
Drew so this is uh a hypothetical
 
02:49:37.030 --> 02:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
question that I'm asking in order to
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
help me understand how this works let's
 
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
say we repeal this
 
02:49:43.990 --> 02:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
statute what would stop the vaccine
 
02:49:45.950 --> 02:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
Association from Simply continuing to
 
02:49:52.269 --> 02:49:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:54.349 --> 02:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
I believe without the statute they would
 
02:49:56.429 --> 02:49:56.439 align:start position:0%
not have the authority authority to
 
02:49:58.429 --> 02:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
collect the funds from the assessors I
 
02:50:00.269 --> 02:50:00.279 align:start position:0%
would um refer to the vaccine
 
02:50:02.990 --> 02:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
Association to answer that question um
 
02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
but it would become a voluntary
 
02:50:08.830 --> 02:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
contribution and not all payers May
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
contribute um so there would be no
 
02:50:14.110 --> 02:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
problem with them giving that money to
 
02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
DHHS to continue the program as is well
 
02:50:20.110 --> 02:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
that would if the Association didn't
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
exist that would not be an option the
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
insur there's no mechanism for insurance
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
to pay the department directly without
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
the vaccine Association okay thank
 
02:50:33.190 --> 02:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
you other
 
02:50:36.269 --> 02:50:36.279 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm seeing done thank
 
02:50:38.550 --> 02:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to step out for a while
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%

thank you to the chair and the other
 
02:51:22.030 --> 02:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
committee members for allowing me to
 
02:51:24.349 --> 02:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
speak today my name is Damen Santana I'm
 
02:51:26.110 --> 02:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
the public health emergency preparedness
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the capillary Public
 
02:51:29.630 --> 02:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
Health Network and I'm here a little
 
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
closer to the microphone sure happy to
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you is that better uh my name is
 
02:51:36.269 --> 02:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
Damen Santana I'm the public health
 
02:51:38.030 --> 02:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness coordinator from
 
02:51:39.950 --> 02:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
the capitol Area Public Health Network
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
which is one of 13 public health
 
02:51:43.870 --> 02:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
networks in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:51:46.590 --> 02:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to testify in opposition to
 
02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
this bill and the reason for that is one
 
02:51:52.990 --> 02:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
of the added benefits of this stream of
 
02:51:55.990 --> 02:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
funding is that it does cover privately
 
02:51:58.750 --> 02:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
insured children uh and where we use
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
that at the public health network level
 
02:52:03.150 --> 02:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
um as an opportunity to both vaccinate
 
02:52:05.309 --> 02:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
and also train emergency responders like
 
02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
Medical Reserve Corps volunteers and ser
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
volunteers is um by holding school-based
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
flu clinics during the school season
 
02:52:16.510 --> 02:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
so without that funding we would of
 
02:52:19.389 --> 02:52:19.399 align:start position:0%
course still be able to vaccinate
 
02:52:22.590 --> 02:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
um students that are vfc eligible but
 
02:52:24.269 --> 02:52:24.279 align:start position:0%
that's a small portion of the students
 
02:52:27.630 --> 02:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
that we do vaccinate and this gives a
 
02:52:30.030 --> 02:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
creates an opportunity for the particip
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
participating public health networks to
 
02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
carry out uh point of dispension uh
 
02:52:38.910 --> 02:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics in a real way that
 
02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have an opportunity to practice
 
02:52:42.670 --> 02:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise we can of course set up mock
 
02:52:44.349 --> 02:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
drills but it's really not the same
 
02:52:46.870 --> 02:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
thing uh and this allows us to run
 
02:52:49.870 --> 02:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
through the practice of performing these
 
02:52:53.349 --> 02:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
with in Cooper in cooperation with
 
02:52:55.349 --> 02:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:52:59.710 --> 02:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
and other entities so the uh increased
 
02:53:02.190 --> 02:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
accessibility also creates an
 
02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity for families that for other
 
02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
reasons may not be able to get
 
02:53:08.229 --> 02:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinated uh at a provider's office or
 
02:53:10.190 --> 02:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
have difficulty we certainly have built
 
02:53:11.590 --> 02:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of strong relationships with
 
02:53:15.309 --> 02:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
School nurses and school um and schools
 
02:53:17.389 --> 02:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
that are working with our program to
 
02:53:19.830 --> 02:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
help us to vaccinate kids that just may
 
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
have a difficult time uh getting
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
vaccinated else for other reasons uh
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's all my testimony but if anybody
 
02:53:29.070 --> 02:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
has any questions I'm happy to do my
 
02:53:31.429 --> 02:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
best to answer them thank you any
 
02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative Paul is off
 
02:53:36.790 --> 02:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madame chair and thank you
 
02:53:39.429 --> 02:53:39.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so we heard that
 
02:53:41.790 --> 02:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
most States uh in the United States
 
02:53:45.469 --> 02:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
don't have Central program like that so
 
02:53:48.910 --> 02:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
have you heard any uh problems from from
 
02:53:52.110 --> 02:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
those states do they have any problem
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
getting reimbursement for childhood
 
02:53:57.070 --> 02:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination or
 
02:53:59.469 --> 02:53:59.479 align:start position:0%
anything uh thank you for your question
 
02:54:02.229 --> 02:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative uh paulov I'm afraid
 
02:54:04.110 --> 02:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
that's outside of my purview because I
 
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
only operate at a regional level uh here
 
02:54:10.309 --> 02:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
around uh the capital area so I serve 24
 
02:54:12.229 --> 02:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
towns in and around conquered New
 
02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I couldn't speak to what
 
02:54:17.229 --> 02:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
other states do or how the reimbursement
 
02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
process works um my testimony today is
 
02:54:21.070 --> 02:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
just to explain that one of the other
 
02:54:22.830 --> 02:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
added benefits of this is that it
 
02:54:25.229 --> 02:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
creates an opportunity for us to take
 
02:54:26.830 --> 02:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer emergency responders that
 
02:54:29.070 --> 02:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
would be called to action during um any
 
02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
kind of outbreak and gives them an
 
02:54:32.590 --> 02:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put those skills into
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
practice to be better prepared uh if the
 
02:54:36.389 --> 02:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
time needed so just an additional
 
02:54:38.190 --> 02:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
benefit that I wanted to share with the
 
02:54:41.309 --> 02:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative Nagel
 
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
02:54:45.309 --> 02:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm just curious
 
02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
out of the 13 Community public health
 
02:54:49.870 --> 02:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
networks how many do participate in the
 
02:54:52.469 --> 02:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
process I'm sorry I don't have those
 
02:54:55.309 --> 02:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
numbers either I work for um Grant
 
02:54:57.229 --> 02:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
United Way so we're an initiative of
 
02:54:59.870 --> 02:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
them we share that with uh the Capital
 
02:55:01.550 --> 02:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
Area Public Health Network so I can say
 
02:55:03.910 --> 02:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
for certainty that uh our two networks
 
02:55:05.830 --> 02:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
do participate the total percentage out
 
02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
of 13 I'm not
 
02:55:10.429 --> 02:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
sure thank you any further
 
02:55:14.030 --> 02:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none appreciate it
 
02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you next
 
02:55:28.229 --> 02:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:34.910 --> 02:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.030 --> 02:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon members of the
 
02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate fry vice
 
02:55:40.790 --> 02:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
president of advocacy at new Futures
 
02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I know you've
 
02:55:45.190 --> 02:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
had a long morning uh we are nonpartisan
 
02:55:47.710 --> 02:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that um Works to
 
02:55:49.309 --> 02:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
improve the health and wellness of New
 
02:55:50.910 --> 02:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and in this role we
 
02:55:53.550 --> 02:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
work extensively with policy makers and
 
02:55:55.389 --> 02:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers and communities to
 
02:55:56.830 --> 02:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
improve overall public health and
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
improve health Equity um I won't repeat
 
02:56:02.030 --> 02:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
what was said I have my testimony that
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
really spells out what the um New
 
02:56:06.830 --> 02:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association does and
 
02:56:08.990 --> 02:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
what it doesn't do I think you heard a
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
little bit about that today I want to be
 
02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
very clear that they do not set vaccine
 
02:56:15.990 --> 02:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
policy they're they're only a funding
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism um they don't mandate vaccines
 
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
or limit parent choice um they and they
 
02:56:23.550 --> 02:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with determining the
 
02:56:25.510 --> 02:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule again they're funding
 
02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism only one thing that hasn't um
 
02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
been covered is you've heard proponents
 
02:56:32.349 --> 02:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill say that the state should
 
02:56:34.830 --> 02:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
not be in the business of vaccines New
 
02:56:36.670 --> 02:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the first state to create
 
02:56:39.790 --> 02:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
this Innovative costeffective model now
 
02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
82% of states have policies to purchase
 
02:56:45.870 --> 02:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines beyond what is aail available
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
through the federal vaccine uh program
 
02:56:51.990 --> 02:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
to reduce cost barriers 14 have
 
02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
replicated New Hampshire's Universal
 
02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
purchasing program I think many people
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
would agree that it is the state's
 
02:57:01.229 --> 02:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
business to use taxpayer funds wisely
 
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
while providing equal access to
 
02:57:05.790 --> 02:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
life-saving immunizations and keeping
 
02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
health care cost down this is good
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
business and all of this is made
 
02:57:11.630 --> 02:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
possible by the New Hampshire vaccines
 
02:57:13.950 --> 02:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
Association role in our state's public
 
02:57:16.469 --> 02:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
health infrastructures for these reasons
 
02:57:18.510 --> 02:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
new Futures urges this committee to vote
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
itl and I'm also going to be handing in
 
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
testimony from Dr suan tansky a
 
02:57:27.389 --> 02:57:27.399 align:start position:0%
pediatrician um and who works at
 
02:57:29.229 --> 02:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth hitchock who is also opposed
 
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
to the bill and has pointed out some
 
02:57:33.150 --> 02:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
really great um what the impacts would
 
02:57:36.429 --> 02:57:36.439 align:start position:0%
be to uh providers into
 
02:57:39.790 --> 02:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
families right on time thank
 
02:57:44.349 --> 02:57:44.359 align:start position:0%

patients receive Medicaid if this bill
 
02:59:04.630 --> 02:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
were to pass you're asking clinicians to

treat patients who have Commercial
 
02:59:09.030 --> 02:59:09.040 align:start position:0%

vaccines for their adult patients who

are uninsured those patients are forced
 
02:59:28.830 --> 02:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
to pay out of pocket or the fqc sends
 
02:59:30.990 --> 02:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
them somewhere else like a commercial
 
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy where they would have to pay
 
02:59:36.110 --> 02:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
out of pocket we cannot buy
 
02:59:39.469 --> 02:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
vaccines in 2023 the ferally qualified
 
02:59:42.389 --> 02:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
Health Centers had $14.5 million in
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care this would add to
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
that uncompensated care burden they
 
02:59:49.269 --> 02:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
can't do it they would have to shut down
 
02:59:52.429 --> 02:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
SES and stop serving patients and also
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
as a parent I implore you to oppose this
 
02:59:59.070 --> 02:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
bill one of my kids is
 
03:00:01.990 --> 03:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
autistic he is 10 years old it has taken
 
03:00:05.070 --> 03:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
him 10 years to feel comfortable to see
 
03:00:08.429 --> 03:00:08.439 align:start position:0%
a clinician my daughter is
 
03:00:10.990 --> 03:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
neurotypical we would have to find a new
 
03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
pedi pediatrician or pay out of pocket
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
we are not unique in this situation
 
03:00:18.710 --> 03:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
there are many families with kids with
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities in the state of New
 
03:00:22.469 --> 03:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't want to have to choose
 
03:00:24.990 --> 03:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
a new pediatric practice when my son
 
03:00:27.710 --> 03:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
with a disability has learned to love
 
03:00:30.389 --> 03:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
his pediatric practice it would be
 
03:00:33.269 --> 03:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
horrible for us I would also want to
 
03:00:36.190 --> 03:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
share with you that in Coos County the
 
03:00:38.710 --> 03:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
only primary care provider in gorm and
 
03:00:40.990 --> 03:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
Berlin is a federally qualified Health
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
Center they treat almost 13,000 patients
 
03:00:46.990 --> 03:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
many of whom are children they cannot
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
afford to buy vaccine scenes out of
 
03:00:51.269 --> 03:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
pocket I'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:00:53.590 --> 03:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
but I'd also like to allow Dr Peters to
 
03:00:56.309 --> 03:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
speak from the perspective of Amis
 
03:00:58.190 --> 03:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
Health which is in
 
03:01:00.870 --> 03:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester hi I'm Kate Peters and I'm a
 
03:01:03.269 --> 03:01:03.279 align:start position:0%
family doctor at amamos health I'm also
 
03:01:05.229 --> 03:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
on the uh Board of the New Hampshire
 
03:01:07.030 --> 03:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
Academy of family physicians and both
 
03:01:08.830 --> 03:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
those organizations have said that I may
 
03:01:10.630 --> 03:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
speak on their behalf today as well as
 
03:01:13.349 --> 03:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
on my own um as a doctor but also as a
 
03:01:17.950 --> 03:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
mom uh we are soundly opposed to HP 524
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
um for many of the reasons that have
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
already been mentioned uh amamos Health
 
03:01:23.790 --> 03:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
where I work is a not profit uh
 
03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Center and we
 
03:01:27.590 --> 03:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
provide comprehensive primary care which
 
03:01:30.309 --> 03:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
includes vaccines to people of all ages
 
03:01:32.190 --> 03:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
um in the Manchester area and
 
03:01:35.190 --> 03:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns um the NHA has been an
 
03:01:37.590 --> 03:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
asset to folks like us um and to
 
03:01:39.070 --> 03:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers across the state
 
03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
since it was formed 23 years ago and
 
03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's hard to imagine as described how we
 
03:01:46.309 --> 03:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
would survive without it at this point
 
03:01:48.309 --> 03:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
um you've already heard what the program
 
03:01:50.190 --> 03:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
does let me just say from a provider
 
03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
perspective and from the perspective of
 
03:01:53.429 --> 03:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
you know running a large organization
 
03:01:56.469 --> 03:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
that cares for a lot of people um as my
 
03:01:58.870 --> 03:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
bosses have shared with me um if this
 
03:02:01.750 --> 03:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill passes and the nhba goes away we
 
03:02:03.150 --> 03:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
will have to create more cumbersome
 
03:02:05.830 --> 03:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
systems um to order and pay for vaccines
 
03:02:10.429 --> 03:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
and and that will be awful for us I hope
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
that you're already aware that we are in
 
03:02:14.429 --> 03:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
a time of unprecedented Financial
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
fragility for our health centers um
 
03:02:19.469 --> 03:02:19.479 align:start position:0%
organization like ours can't afford to
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
purchase these vaccines um paying
 
03:02:23.429 --> 03:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
upfront and not knowing whether the cost
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
will be adequately reimbursed um we
 
03:02:27.229 --> 03:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
don't have a budget for it and we don't
 
03:02:30.750 --> 03:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
have a system for it um so as a family
 
03:02:32.349 --> 03:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
doctor I can see how that's going to
 
03:02:34.190 --> 03:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
cause chaos for lots of families like
 
03:02:37.150 --> 03:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
yours across the state um and as a mom I
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
can see how damaging this would be this
 
03:02:42.510 --> 03:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
would result in families needing to
 
03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
change practices or take their kids to
 
03:02:46.670 --> 03:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
separate appointments to get vaccinated
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
which means more days days off work more
 
03:02:51.510 --> 03:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
stress um and fewer kids getting
 
03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines overall and this is going to
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
disproportionately harm needy families
 
03:02:58.429 --> 03:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
um you know my job as a healthcare
 
03:03:00.349 --> 03:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
provider at an fqc and your job as
 
03:03:03.229 --> 03:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
lawmakers is to protect equity in our
 
03:03:05.229 --> 03:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
Health Care Systems and this build does
 
03:03:07.790 --> 03:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
the opposite of that um it asks us to
 
03:03:10.190 --> 03:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
dismantle a well-established highly
 
03:03:13.150 --> 03:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
effective highly efficient organization
 
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
that saves money for our state and keeps
 
03:03:17.429 --> 03:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
people healthy so the obvious choice is
 
03:03:19.830 --> 03:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
to vote itl and I encourage you to do so
 
03:03:21.349 --> 03:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
I'm also happy to take questions if you
 
03:03:21.359 --> 03:03:22.190 align:start position:0%
I'm also happy to take questions if you
have

03:03:22.190 --> 03:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:03:25.830 --> 03:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
any thank you representative
 
03:03:28.110 --> 03:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
poov thank you Madame chair and thank
 
03:03:30.990 --> 03:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh uh it's
 
03:03:34.710 --> 03:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
probably uh for first Speaker Christin
 
03:03:38.269 --> 03:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
St that uh you mentioned uncompensated
 
03:03:42.630 --> 03:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh care so given that we are talking
 
03:03:46.990 --> 03:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
about different demographics some people
 
03:03:51.150 --> 03:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
ensure it and ensure it on Medicaid so
 
03:03:55.070 --> 03:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
in what groups do you fore
 
03:03:59.790 --> 03:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
uncompensated uh care uh do you expect
 
03:04:02.429 --> 03:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
um private insurance companies uh
 
03:04:05.229 --> 03:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
denying reimbursements for vaccines do
 
03:04:08.910 --> 03:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
you expect uh I don't know Medicaid not
 
03:04:12.110 --> 03:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursing and so on sure so this bill
 
03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
is only applicable to commercially
 
03:04:18.349 --> 03:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
insured kids so what would happen is is
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
if the fqc could theoretically buy
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines which they cannot they would
 
03:04:28.550 --> 03:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
buy the vaccines magically and store
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
them and then wait for the insurance
 
03:04:32.309 --> 03:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
carriers the commercially insured
 
03:04:34.469 --> 03:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
carriers to reimburse them for that
 
03:04:38.309 --> 03:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
their vaccines when the new RSB vaccine
 
03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
came out our community health centers
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
were heartbroken because here's a
 
03:04:47.070 --> 03:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
resource that they know their patients
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
need but they could not buy them out of
 
03:04:53.550 --> 03:04:53.560 align:start position:0%
pocket so this bill would contribute to
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
the uncompensated care of the
 
03:04:58.950 --> 03:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
commercially insured population not the
 
03:04:58.960 --> 03:05:00.309 align:start position:0%
commercially insured population not the
Medicaid

03:05:00.309 --> 03:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
population if that makes
 
03:05:05.910 --> 03:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
sense thank you any further
 
03:05:10.110 --> 03:05:10.120 align:start position:0%

for giving me the opportunity to speak
 
03:05:59.469 --> 03:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
in opposition of House Bill
 
03:06:01.710 --> 03:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
524 the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:06:03.870 --> 03:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
Association has created a bridge for
 
03:06:06.670 --> 03:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine providers to receive all acip
 
03:06:09.309 --> 03:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines at no cost and they
 
03:06:11.389 --> 03:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
have lowered barriers for families to
 
03:06:14.349 --> 03:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
help prevent vaccine preventable
 
03:06:16.750 --> 03:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
diseases now can you imagine our world
 
03:06:18.070 --> 03:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
without Bridges
 
03:06:19.990 --> 03:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
we would all have to take the long way
 
03:06:22.269 --> 03:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
around and it would cost a lot more
 
03:06:25.349 --> 03:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
money to drive completely around a river
 
03:06:27.950 --> 03:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
if it was even possible and would it
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
surprise you if folks chose to drive
 
03:06:32.590 --> 03:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
through a river because it was faster
 
03:06:34.469 --> 03:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
Along with the state's private insurance
 
03:06:38.229 --> 03:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
companies allow Public Health
 
03:06:40.870 --> 03:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
departments medical providers as well as
 
03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Care Centers
 
03:06:45.630 --> 03:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
to bridge a very important Health Care
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
Gap vaccines for all of New Hampshire's
 
03:06:52.030 --> 03:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
children as a public health nurse and
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccine coordinator for the city of
 
03:06:55.950 --> 03:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
NASA Public Health Department I see the
 
03:06:57.870 --> 03:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
health and human worth in protecting our
 
03:07:00.269 --> 03:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
children as well as the beneficial
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
Financial impact of providing vaccines
 
03:07:05.469 --> 03:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
to all of New Hampshire's children
 
03:07:07.469 --> 03:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
regardless of their insurance status or
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
03:07:11.070 --> 03:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
pay without the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:07:13.389 --> 03:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
Association healthc care providers like
 
03:07:15.870 --> 03:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
myself and my colleagues would be unable
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
to provide no cost vaccine
 
03:07:20.469 --> 03:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
to all of New Hampshire's children
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't our goal be to bridge gaps and
 
03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
reduce barriers for our children's good
 
03:07:29.229 --> 03:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
health so now I ask you to consider our
 
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
great beautiful state without our
 
03:07:33.469 --> 03:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
bridges this is Sim similar to how
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
repealing the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
Association committee could affect our
 
03:07:39.469 --> 03:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
children do we need to be reminded of
 
03:07:41.790 --> 03:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
what life was like without our bridges
 
03:07:44.630 --> 03:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
or when children were dying of polio and
 
03:07:46.630 --> 03:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
diptheria please do not put another
 
03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
barrier up for our families who need
 
03:07:50.750 --> 03:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
help in keeping their children safe and
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
healthy and if you aren't able to see
 
03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
the health benefits of what the New
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association does
 
03:07:59.389 --> 03:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
please think about the financial benefit
 
03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
of keeping our children our future
 
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
healthy out of the hospital and
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
Alive please please allow the New
 
03:08:11.550 --> 03:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association to bridge
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
the gap for our children in aose House
 
03:08:13.760 --> 03:08:14.710 align:start position:0%
the gap for our children in aose House
Bill

03:08:14.710 --> 03:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
524 thank you all for listening thank
 
03:08:19.429 --> 03:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
you any questions does the committee
 
03:08:20.670 --> 03:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
have any
 
03:08:23.349 --> 03:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none all right
 
03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
03:08:32.670 --> 03:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.790 --> 03:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
again for the record for the record I'm
 
03:08:51.229 --> 03:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
Jerry kerk uh for full disclosure though
 
03:08:53.710 --> 03:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
I have to re uh St that uh Senator
 
03:08:55.229 --> 03:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
Bradley appointed me to the New
 
03:08:57.150 --> 03:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association board last
 
03:08:59.870 --> 03:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
fall but I am not speaking on their
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
behalf I'm testifying as a retired
 
03:09:02.950 --> 03:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
physician and
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislator vaccination is one of the
 
03:09:06.630 --> 03:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
most effective Public Health measures in
 
03:09:08.110 --> 03:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
history if you've explored our old
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
cemeteries you'll see lots of uh
 
03:09:11.429 --> 03:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
tombstones from the 18th and 19th
 
03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
century with little kids names on them
 
03:09:15.070 --> 03:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
and note that frequently several
 
03:09:16.590 --> 03:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
children would die in the same month in
 
03:09:19.269 --> 03:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
the same family why is that because of
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases things that we do
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
not see anymore and of course polio and
 
03:09:24.990 --> 03:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
small pox are great examples of the
 
03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
impact of vaccination now here's the key
 
03:09:31.750 --> 03:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
issue the great majority of parents in
 
03:09:34.389 --> 03:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccinate their children
 
03:09:37.150 --> 03:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
against communicable diseases that
 
03:09:40.190 --> 03:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that your constituents need
 
03:09:43.229 --> 03:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
and want access to vaccination it is our
 
03:09:45.110 --> 03:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
duty then to provide those vaccinations
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
in the most coste efficient fashion and
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
with the least administrative burden on
 
03:09:52.950 --> 03:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
providers and insurers the universal
 
03:09:54.750 --> 03:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine purchase program established by
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 126 Q provides precisely that and I
 
03:09:59.950 --> 03:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
won't go into the details because it's
 
03:10:02.429 --> 03:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
already been given the old-timers here
 
03:10:05.110 --> 03:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
will remember that I tried to expand the
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine Association to
 
03:10:11.070 --> 03:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
cover adults as well back in 2020 it was
 
03:10:13.950 --> 03:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
not rejected due to cost it failed since
 
03:10:17.309 --> 03:10:17.319 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies refused to to participate
 
03:10:19.349 --> 03:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
and they were significant uh providers
 
03:10:21.630 --> 03:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
of adult vaccinations and therefore it
 
03:10:24.389 --> 03:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
was just not a viable option so if this
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass there will be one of
 
03:10:29.790 --> 03:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
two outcomes either we would not have a
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
system for childhood vaccine or a new
 
03:10:36.030 --> 03:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
system would need to be set up in the
 
03:10:37.910 --> 03:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
first scenario where there's no
 
03:10:40.229 --> 03:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
Universal vaccine purchase program there
 
03:10:42.110 --> 03:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
would be an increased administrative
 
03:10:44.550 --> 03:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
burden on providers for ordering
 
03:10:48.030 --> 03:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines increased cost to the vaccines
 
03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
and increased administrative costs
 
03:10:51.950 --> 03:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
associated with billing for both payers
 
03:10:51.960 --> 03:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
associated with billing for both payers
and

03:10:52.790 --> 03:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:55.070 --> 03:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
providers therefore cost was increased
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
for insurers and providers resulting in
 
03:11:00.030 --> 03:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
increased cost to all of us it would
 
03:11:01.950 --> 03:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
likely result in decreased vaccination
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
rates leading to outbreaks of
 
03:11:07.269 --> 03:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases and ultimately the
 
03:11:10.910 --> 03:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
biggest cost vaccine preventable deaths
 
03:11:13.710 --> 03:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
of our children the other scenario in
 
03:11:16.229 --> 03:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
which a new system within DHHS would be
 
03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
created would require ire authorization
 
03:11:19.990 --> 03:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the department to hire individuals to
 
03:11:22.349 --> 03:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
perform the Service rulemaking authority
 
03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
and appropriation to cover those costs
 
03:11:27.070 --> 03:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
but none of that is in this bill and
 
03:11:28.469 --> 03:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
there's probably not much appetite for
 
03:11:30.030 --> 03:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
another appropriation in this already
 
03:11:32.710 --> 03:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat difficult budget year it would
 
03:11:34.429 --> 03:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
also take time to become functional
 
03:11:35.950 --> 03:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
during which time we would see the
 
03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
problems of not having a
 
03:11:41.070 --> 03:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
system the current system works very
 
03:11:44.269 --> 03:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
well with an extremely low overhead we
 
03:11:46.750 --> 03:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
owe it to our providers insurers and our
 
03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
owe it to our providers insurers and our
children

03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:11:50.190 --> 03:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
to maintain the current system which has
 
03:11:51.710 --> 03:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
given New Hampshire one of the highest
 
03:11:53.870 --> 03:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates in the nation with
 
03:11:56.309 --> 03:11:56.319 align:start position:0%
excellent cost savings and minimal
 
03:11:58.830 --> 03:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
administrative burden so please itl this
 
03:12:00.389 --> 03:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd be glad to take any
 
03:12:03.110 --> 03:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative paaz
 
03:12:05.550 --> 03:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
off thank you Madame chair and thank you
 
03:12:09.670 --> 03:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh so regarding
 
03:12:12.190 --> 03:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
the cost uh to
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
DS uh we heard in testimony that they
 
03:12:20.590 --> 03:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
don't uh expect uh much savings because
 
03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
um all the current uh administrative
 
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
cost uh inside the department is covered
 
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
federally so I would assume if they need
 
03:12:33.550 --> 03:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
to create a new system uh for for the
 
03:12:36.110 --> 03:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
same purpose it also would be covered
 
03:12:40.269 --> 03:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
fully federally so I think uh in your
 
03:12:42.429 --> 03:12:42.439 align:start position:0%
second scenario we actually looking do
 
03:12:45.229 --> 03:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
you have a question for him uh would you
 
03:12:48.389 --> 03:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
agree that we are looking to saving
 
03:12:50.269 --> 03:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars of
 
03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
administration cost because they will be
 
03:12:52.880 --> 03:12:53.830 align:start position:0%
administration cost because they will be
covered

03:12:53.830 --> 03:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
covered
 
03:12:56.670 --> 03:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
federally the federal does not cover the
 
03:12:58.590 --> 03:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
private insurer
 
03:13:01.190 --> 03:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
aggregation so that I'm pretty sure I'm
 
03:13:04.150 --> 03:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
correct on that and so as a result the
 
03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
issue is again it was a dichotomous
 
03:13:07.150 --> 03:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
either we don't have a system or we've
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
got to set up a system and if we set up
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
a system we need to actually fund that
 
03:13:15.710 --> 03:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
bill represent of
 
03:13:23.469 --> 03:13:23.479 align:start position:0%
Sebert um so I was so in your opinion I
 
03:13:27.229 --> 03:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
guess overall um is it your opinion that
 
03:13:30.550 --> 03:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
the vaccination Association if dis if
 
03:13:30.560 --> 03:13:32.349 align:start position:0%
the vaccination Association if dis if
dissolved

03:13:32.349 --> 03:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
dissolved
 
03:13:37.910 --> 03:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
would within the hell hold on so if this
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
if if the vaccination Association were
 
03:13:44.150 --> 03:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
dissolved would all of these providers
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and health departments be able to
 
03:13:51.030 --> 03:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
um absorb the costs to vaccinate
 
03:13:53.229 --> 03:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
children to keep children vaccinated or
 
03:13:54.670 --> 03:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
what would happen in that case I think
 
03:13:56.710 --> 03:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's beyond my knowledge but you've
 
03:14:00.110 --> 03:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
heard multiple providers and practices
 
03:14:03.790 --> 03:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
in by State uh already explain that they
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
will have a very hard time absorbing
 
03:14:07.309 --> 03:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
that so I think that's the answer to

Society I'm representing the Medical
 
03:15:34.990 --> 03:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
Society on behalf of our nearly 2,000
 
03:15:38.110 --> 03:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
members today we strongly oppose House
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 524 the legislation that seeks to
 
03:15:44.670 --> 03:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
disband the uh New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
Association um the medical society's
 
03:15:48.750 --> 03:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
mission is to advocate for the
 
03:15:51.469 --> 03:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
well-being of our patients and promote
 
03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
Public Health HB 524 poses a direct
 
03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
threat to both of these goals the New
 
03:15:59.750 --> 03:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association plays a
 
03:16:02.349 --> 03:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
critical role in safeguarding public
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
health particularly by increasing access
 
03:16:07.229 --> 03:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
to life-saving immunizations and
 
03:16:09.070 --> 03:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
reducing the financial burden on
 
03:16:12.189 --> 03:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
families in the state um we urge you to
 
03:16:15.429 --> 03:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
vote itl on this bill I'm not going to
 
03:16:17.550 --> 03:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
repeat a lot of the the testimony that
 
03:16:18.990 --> 03:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard today but I do want to
 
03:16:20.710 --> 03:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
highlight the clinicians and the
 
03:16:23.349 --> 03:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
Physicians who have spoken um and I want
 
03:16:25.269 --> 03:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
to highlight that several of our members
 
03:16:28.269 --> 03:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
have also submitted uh testimony online
 
03:16:31.870 --> 03:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
today um this bill allows healthc care
 
03:16:35.070 --> 03:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
providers to administer vaccines to any
 
03:16:37.150 --> 03:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
child regardless of their insurance
 
03:16:40.150 --> 03:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
status or family income this ensures
 
03:16:41.910 --> 03:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
that all children have access to
 
03:16:44.429 --> 03:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
vaccines that prevent serious illnesses
 
03:16:47.590 --> 03:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
hospitalization and even death um our
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
second point today is that the New
 
03:16:53.910 --> 03:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association Collective
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
purchasing power allows New Hampshire to
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
negotiate better rates for vaccines
 
03:17:01.110 --> 03:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
saving taxpayers Millions each
 
03:17:03.389 --> 03:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
year it's important to note that the New
 
03:17:05.229 --> 03:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association does not
 
03:17:07.269 --> 03:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
set vaccine policy or create vaccine
 
03:17:09.590 --> 03:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
laws in the state its sole purpose is to
 
03:17:12.189 --> 03:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
collect and distribute funding as we've
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
heard um so vaccines can be purchased
 
03:17:17.030 --> 03:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
and administered to Children across the
 
03:17:19.309 --> 03:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
state in conclusion the New Hampshire
 
03:17:21.389 --> 03:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association is key a key
 
03:17:24.110 --> 03:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
component of our state's Public Health
 
03:17:26.349 --> 03:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it increases the access
 
03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
to vaccines save saves the state money
 
03:17:31.630 --> 03:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
and most importantly protects the health
 
03:17:34.189 --> 03:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
and well-being of our children the the
 
03:17:36.550 --> 03:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
Medical Society strongly opposes House
 
03:17:39.550 --> 03:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 524 and urges the committee to vote
 
03:17:41.710 --> 03:17:41.720 align:start position:0%

taking my question uh I have a question
 
03:17:54.110 --> 03:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
about insurance
 
03:17:57.750 --> 03:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
part uh so I I never heard New Hampshire
 
03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
insurance company coming out and saying
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
that uh they opposed to vaccination that
 
03:18:07.870 --> 03:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
the data showing it's ineffective so if
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
they think that it's a good thing and
 
03:18:16.110 --> 03:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
it's helps uh uh wouldn't they be
 
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
willing to cover the bill and fully
 
03:18:22.110 --> 03:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
reimburse vaccination effort even
 
03:18:25.150 --> 03:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
without vaccine

members of the Health and Human Services
 
03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Mark
 
03:34:23.070 --> 03:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
mlan representing Hillsboro district 15
 
03:34:25.950 --> 03:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
which is Manchester Ward 8 I'm here to
 
03:34:27.750 --> 03:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
introduce HB
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
548 which builds upon the direct Primary
 
03:34:33.910 --> 03:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
Care legislation we passed in 2019 by
 
03:34:36.189 --> 03:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
extending that Health Care model to
 
03:34:39.950 --> 03:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities it amends RSA 151
 
03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:41.070 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities it amends RSA 151
colon

03:34:41.070 --> 03:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
colon
 
03:34:45.070 --> 03:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
2-f um one by allowing those Health Care
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
Facilities that operate on a membership
 
03:34:50.229 --> 03:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
based model or exclusively take direct
 
03:34:52.910 --> 03:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
payment for services to be excluded from
 
03:34:55.750 --> 03:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
an requirement to accept all modes of
 
03:34:55.760 --> 03:34:57.269 align:start position:0%
an requirement to accept all modes of
payment

03:34:57.269 --> 03:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
payment
 
03:34:59.910 --> 03:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
so the legislation is being brought
 
03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
forward in attempt to drive towards
 
03:35:03.710 --> 03:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
increased transparency we heard a little
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
bit about that this morning um in uh HB
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh 743 to drive towards increasing
 
03:35:12.590 --> 03:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
transparency in health care pricing but
 
03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
also to introduce uh new service models
 
03:35:17.229 --> 03:35:17.239 align:start position:0%
to underserved
 
03:35:19.110 --> 03:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
communities I think that one of the
 
03:35:21.189 --> 03:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
areas where the Affordable Care Act fell
 
03:35:23.389 --> 03:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
short was in its promise to bring health
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
care costs under control it expanded
 
03:35:28.110 --> 03:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
access but it really didn't do a lot on
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
the cost Side in New Hampshire healthc
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
care costs have gone up at 1.8 times the
 
03:35:35.790 --> 03:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
rate of groceries two times the rate of
 
03:35:37.910 --> 03:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
transportation and four times the rate
 
03:35:40.750 --> 03:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
of clothing only housing and energy
 
03:35:42.510 --> 03:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
costs have gone up at a higher rate and
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
I think you know we understand a lot of
 
03:35:47.189 --> 03:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
of what the drivers are behind that a
 
03:35:49.349 --> 03:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
key element in bringing the promise of
 
03:35:51.510 --> 03:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act into reality was
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the introduction of
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
clearer more understandable pricing
 
03:35:57.870 --> 03:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
information that would encourage people
 
03:36:00.670 --> 03:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
to shop around and enhance competition
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
and they did put the charge Masters out
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
there but really um this full
 
03:36:09.269 --> 03:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
transparency never really happened and
 
03:36:12.189 --> 03:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
as you heard from testimony this morning
 
03:36:14.510 --> 03:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
um uh Healthcare building remains as
 
03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
Byzantine as it's always been so I want
 
03:36:18.870 --> 03:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
to give you a quick history on how I
 
03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
came to this bill a few years ago I was
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
in a minor car accident I felt fine my
 
03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
wife she's paranoid you got to go down
 
03:36:27.710 --> 03:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
you got to get checked out so I go down
 
03:36:30.510 --> 03:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
to the Urgent Care and I said hey you
 
03:36:32.750 --> 03:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
know I was just in a minor fender bender
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'm fine but could I get checked out and
 
03:36:37.349 --> 03:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
they said sure we can check you out and
 
03:36:39.630 --> 03:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
I said well how much is it going to cost
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
and they said well we can't tell you
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
until after we render service and I said
 
03:36:45.910 --> 03:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
listen if it's going to be one or two
 
03:36:48.670 --> 03:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
$0000 that's fine I'll give my wife
 
03:36:50.790 --> 03:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
peace of mind but if I'm going to get
 
03:36:53.990 --> 03:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
slammed with a $1,200 bill or something
 
03:36:56.110 --> 03:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you know my wife is just going
 
03:36:58.349 --> 03:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
to have to suffer a little bit and do
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
without transparency but again they said
 
03:37:03.189 --> 03:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
there's no way we cannot tell you the
 
03:37:07.229 --> 03:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
price not even the ballpark um until uh
 
03:37:10.510 --> 03:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
we render the service and really guys
 
03:37:13.710 --> 03:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
can you imagine that happening with the
 
03:37:16.150 --> 03:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
delivery of any other kind of service
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's just it it it just doesn't happen
 
03:37:20.870 --> 03:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
so I've tried a couple times one of my
 
03:37:22.990 --> 03:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
first legislative attempts at
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
introducing transparency was a bill
 
03:37:27.389 --> 03:37:27.399 align:start position:0%
requiring Health Providers to provide a
 
03:37:30.110 --> 03:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable estimate of non-emergency
 
03:37:32.309 --> 03:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
Services kind of along the lines what we
 
03:37:35.110 --> 03:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
heard this morning was 743 but I
 
03:37:37.229 --> 03:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
promptly got a call from the deputy
 
03:37:38.950 --> 03:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner on that one he
 
03:37:40.870 --> 03:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
said hey because New Hampshire is a very
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
small state such legislation might
 
03:37:45.550 --> 03:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
actually lead to price increases or even
 
03:37:47.790 --> 03:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
have insurance companies pull out of the
 
03:37:49.510 --> 03:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
state all together and it didn't have
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
some of the nuances that the bill we
 
03:37:53.309 --> 03:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
heard this morning had but I was left in
 
03:37:55.950 --> 03:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
the unin position of that one going to
 
03:37:57.910 --> 03:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee and saying uh I'm
 
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to P pull my own bill um but then
 
03:38:03.790 --> 03:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
no surprises became federal law and I
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
said hey maybe this is is is an Avenue
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
and maybe what we can do is you know New
 
03:38:11.550 --> 03:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a small state so we
 
03:38:13.950 --> 03:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the Firepower to do that
 
03:38:17.150 --> 03:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
just here but if we can kind of move in
 
03:38:19.830 --> 03:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
with no surprises and build on what is
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
already there federally um maybe we can
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
do something but as I sadly discovered
 
03:38:28.110 --> 03:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
no surprises only covers the uninsured
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
and the self-insured and it's completely
 
03:38:33.070 --> 03:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
inadequate as a foundation really on
 
03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
building the tri transparency that the
 
03:38:37.469 --> 03:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire residents
 
03:38:40.189 --> 03:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
would want so that's where we come to
 
03:38:43.550 --> 03:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill it adopts an
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
alexandrian approach to price trans
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
transparency by just cutting through
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
that gordian knot of Healthcare billing
 
03:38:52.870 --> 03:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
to go to the direct pay model as I said
 
03:38:55.469 --> 03:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
the direct pay model this is a model
 
03:38:58.389 --> 03:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
that we've already seen operate
 
03:39:00.510 --> 03:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
successfully you know when it comes to
 
03:39:03.150 --> 03:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
the direct Primary Care you know because
 
03:39:04.990 --> 03:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
in order for such a model to work there
 
03:39:08.830 --> 03:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
truly has to be no surprises in pricing
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
because most people get their insurance
 
03:39:13.070 --> 03:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
from the commercial Market or enrolled
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
in Medicare or Medicaid uh the use R I
 
03:39:18.750 --> 03:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
think for facilities using that model is
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
going to be relatively low it's not like
 
03:39:23.349 --> 03:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to be all over the state and
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't even seen the direct Primary
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
Care go all over the state so I think
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
the uptake is going to be low however
 
03:39:32.349 --> 03:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
for those folks who are uninsured
 
03:39:35.110 --> 03:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
self-insured or have high deductibles
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
the idea of knowing upfront how much
 
03:39:40.349 --> 03:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
your colonoscopy is going to cost may
 
03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
have enormous appeal and even a small
 
03:39:45.389 --> 03:39:45.399 align:start position:0%
amount of competition may start to
 
03:39:48.349 --> 03:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
generate change so I kind of think this
 
03:39:51.150 --> 03:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
is the incremental change that the
 
03:39:53.110 --> 03:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the insurance department
 
03:39:55.750 --> 03:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
was talking about when he talked about
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
743 there's not going to be anything
 
03:40:00.510 --> 03:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
that kind of gets us all the way there
 
03:40:02.750 --> 03:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
but this by building on this direct
 
03:40:05.590 --> 03:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
Primary Care model that we already have
 
03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
it it just starts to open things up a
 
03:40:10.229 --> 03:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
little bit releasing facilities from the
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
all payer model will also release them
 
03:40:14.830 --> 03:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
from the enormous administrative burden
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
that it genders and we heard
 
03:40:18.750 --> 03:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel talk about that
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
doctors become doctors because of the
 
03:40:22.990 --> 03:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
desire to care for others they're not
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
accountants they don't want to be
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
accountants but close to half the
 
03:40:28.269 --> 03:40:28.279 align:start position:0%
administrative burden operating a
 
03:40:30.990 --> 03:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
facility is tied to billing if that can
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
be eliminated there's potentially we may
 
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
see the expansion of services in
 
03:40:38.110 --> 03:40:38.120 align:start position:0%
underserved areas and again we're
 
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
already starting to see that on the
 
03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
direct Primary Care front it won't be
 
03:40:44.030 --> 03:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
for everyone but it will introduce
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
competition new approaches and possibly
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
exposure to innovative ways to deliver
 
03:40:53.070 --> 03:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
healthare now one of the main objections
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
to HP 548 and those you guys been around
 
03:40:58.510 --> 03:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit know is the fear that it's
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
going to decimate New Hampshire's
 
03:41:03.150 --> 03:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals okay that's
 
03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's a fear I personally think looking
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
at the update rate on the direct primary
 
03:41:09.870 --> 03:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
care it's not going to be enough that
 
03:41:12.150 --> 03:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
this is going to hit like a hammer um I
 
03:41:13.550 --> 03:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be slow on the
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
uptake um you know and one thing to note
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
though is that the benefit of being a
 
03:41:20.429 --> 03:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
critical access hospital and the
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
protections of RSA 151 remain unchanged
 
03:41:26.429 --> 03:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
by this bill okay so the exclusion Zone
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
remains intact the 100% Medicare
 
03:41:31.990 --> 03:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement remains intact the 247
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
emergency room requirement for new
 
03:41:36.429 --> 03:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
facilities remains intact so critical
 
03:41:39.269 --> 03:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
access hospitals are still going to have
 
03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of insulation a lot of armor
 
03:41:45.030 --> 03:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
against competition but you know but the
 
03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
question question is this are we
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
protecting critical access hospitals
 
03:41:52.389 --> 03:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
merely for the sake of protecting
 
03:41:54.870 --> 03:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals the federal
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
critical access access Hospital act went
 
03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
into effect in 1997 in attempt to
 
03:42:03.030 --> 03:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
preserve Health Care access in the
 
03:42:05.229 --> 03:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
nation's rural communities okay that's
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
the real goal the real goal is to expand
 
03:42:11.429 --> 03:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
and preserve access not to preserve the
 
03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals for their own
 
03:42:15.590 --> 03:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
sake but one of the ways that I think
 
03:42:18.429 --> 03:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
the critical access law actually impedes
 
03:42:21.429 --> 03:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
the expansion of access is that it caps
 
03:42:24.189 --> 03:42:24.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of hospital beds at 25 so I
 
03:42:26.149 --> 03:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
asked legislative research about Trends
 
03:42:27.389 --> 03:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
in the bed count in the state's
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals and quickly discovered that
 
03:42:32.149 --> 03:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
the trend obviously is flat even though
 
03:42:34.349 --> 03:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
the population of New Hampshire has
 
03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
continued to increase we've gone up
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
450,000 in the last 4 years since the
 
03:42:42.269 --> 03:42:42.279 align:start position:0%
last hospital was built in in New
 
03:42:45.469 --> 03:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yet Alice peek 25 beds
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
andersin Valley Hospital 25 beds Cottage
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
Hospital 25 beds Franklin Hospital 25
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
beds all these hospitals 25 beds they
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
will never have a 26th bed they will
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
never have a 27th bed because if these
 
03:43:04.149 --> 03:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals even if they could if they
 
03:43:07.030 --> 03:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
staff beyond the 25 bed count you know
 
03:43:08.429 --> 03:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen they're going to
 
03:43:11.070 --> 03:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
lose their critical access Hospital
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
status so I think in that way it's
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
actually an impediment to to growth so I
 
03:43:20.149 --> 03:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
think recognizing this um I think if new
 
03:43:22.830 --> 03:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
methodologies emerge that can offer an
 
03:43:25.990 --> 03:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
alternative way to expand access I think
 
03:43:27.510 --> 03:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
that they should be explored I don't
 
03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
think this is going to happen overnight
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
but I don't think we should be Tethered
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
to a single path to providing Health
 
03:43:36.990 --> 03:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
Care um you know medical access is
 
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
increasingly a threat we hear it on the
 
03:43:39.830 --> 03:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
news all the time they're closing down
 
03:43:41.070 --> 03:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
this they're closing down that we hear
 
03:43:43.389 --> 03:43:43.399 align:start position:0%
that in this committee all the time I
 
03:43:45.389 --> 03:43:45.399 align:start position:0%
think we should be considering an all of
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
the above approach and I think just like
 
03:43:49.269 --> 03:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from the insurance
 
03:43:51.630 --> 03:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
department said this morning this is
 
03:43:54.070 --> 03:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
kind of that incremental path or at
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
least a part of it so um with that I'll
 
03:44:00.389 --> 03:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
take any questions I do have some uh
 
03:44:01.830 --> 03:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
subject experts that I'm bringing in
 
03:44:04.189 --> 03:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
behind me uh so I'd ask you to save some
 
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
of your Firepower for them but I'll do
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
the best I can to ask any questions you
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
may have to the next bill are did you
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
testify the wrong Bill no I'm going to
 
03:44:15.389 --> 03:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
testify the next they're all over laugh
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
Jerry all right thank you representative
 
03:44:21.349 --> 03:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and
 
03:44:26.429 --> 03:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate although I don't agree with
 
03:44:31.469 --> 03:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
your issue your your point about the
 
03:44:34.830 --> 03:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals uh we do have
 
03:44:37.389 --> 03:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
here some eloquent testimony that you
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
probably haven't seen yet from the uh
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
Roman Catholic dasis of Manchester on
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
behalf of Catholic Charities and the
 
03:44:48.670 --> 03:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
nurse in homes that they run and there
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
how do you respond to their concern
 
03:44:56.189 --> 03:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
which is that the nursing homes that
 
03:44:58.590 --> 03:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
they run and I think this also applies
 
03:45:00.429 --> 03:45:00.439 align:start position:0%
to the County nursing homes and others
 
03:45:03.870 --> 03:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
as well they depend for their funding on
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
a mix of Medicaid um a little bit of
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
Medicare and some private pay and if you
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
allow now facilities completely
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
unregulated because it removes the
 
03:45:23.429 --> 03:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
regulation for private pay um Cash basis
 
03:45:23.439 --> 03:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
regulation for private pay um Cash basis
payment

03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
payment
 
03:45:28.269 --> 03:45:28.279 align:start position:0%
facilities uh how do you respond to
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
their concerns that the top payment
 
03:45:36.269 --> 03:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
Source the ones who pay the most to
 
03:45:40.149 --> 03:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
their facilities uh will be skimmed off
 
03:45:44.670 --> 03:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
and that leaves their facilities to in
 
03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
in more financial Peril with respect to
 
03:45:50.429 --> 03:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:56.269 --> 03:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
homes so um I I think that most people
 
03:45:59.590 --> 03:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
um they they they have a variety of
 
03:46:01.389 --> 03:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
sources Medicare Medicare I know the
 
03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County nursing home um is
 
03:46:06.550 --> 03:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
reasonably solvent because it's it's got
 
03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
a higher percentage of of Medicare um
 
03:46:15.030 --> 03:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
but I I I do believe that for
 
03:46:18.750 --> 03:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
most people um you're just not going to
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
have enough people that are going to opt
 
03:46:24.030 --> 03:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
for that that you're going to be able to
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
make a heavy business case early on so I
 
03:46:29.229 --> 03:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
don't think um you're going to see
 
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes going up on across the
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
field that are all private pay I just
 
03:46:35.710 --> 03:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's enough of a
 
03:46:39.189 --> 03:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
population to support that I did ask
 
03:46:40.870 --> 03:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
legislative research because I'm trying
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
to understand the penetration um and
 
03:46:48.149 --> 03:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to get Beno pelier worked
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
on it for like two and a half months and
 
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
he sent me the final email last night
 
03:46:54.670 --> 03:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
and he said I'm sorry but it's it's a
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
dry desert of data out there but you
 
03:47:01.070 --> 03:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
know based on what I do know um I I just
 
03:47:02.950 --> 03:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's enough of of a
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
business case but I don't unfortunately
 
03:47:07.269 --> 03:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
represented we I don't have any hard
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
data to support that what I would say
 
03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
and I didn't because I didn't want to
 
03:47:12.189 --> 03:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
get I didn't have time to get into all
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
my testimony but one of the things that
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
the bill does do is it does you know ask
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
HHS to do a study looking at the
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
penetration of of the direct pay models
 
03:47:28.510 --> 03:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
and the impact that it would have uh
 
03:47:30.149 --> 03:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
this is kind of my third time coming
 
03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
back to the well and and and I I wish I
 
03:47:34.950 --> 03:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
had more hard data to give you that
 
03:47:37.149 --> 03:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
answer but my gut is telling me that the
 
03:47:41.309 --> 03:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
uptake is not going to be heavy follow
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
up so uh my guts giving me a different
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
reaction but that's not the purpose for
 
03:47:53.269 --> 03:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
right now um my followup is with respect
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:47:57.309 --> 03:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
study are you not putting the cart
 
03:48:00.630 --> 03:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
before the horse would it not be best to
 
03:48:03.429 --> 03:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
have this bill create the
 
03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
study and then based on the results of
 
03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:08.110 align:start position:0%
study and then based on the results of
the

03:48:08.110 --> 03:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:08.120 --> 03:48:09.790 align:start position:0%
the
study

03:48:09.790 --> 03:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
decide how much and which areas because
 
03:48:15.030 --> 03:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
this bill paints with a very very very
 
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
broad brush across health care
 
03:48:20.950 --> 03:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
facilities and as I say I I'm concerned
 
03:48:23.070 --> 03:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
about all of them but I'm particularly
 
03:48:25.510 --> 03:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the nursing homes
 
03:48:27.950 --> 03:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
because I see no reason
 
03:48:31.469 --> 03:48:31.479 align:start position:0%
why a facility isn't going to be built
 
03:48:34.510 --> 03:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
that is completely unregulated because
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's you know anybody can build one and
 
03:48:39.389 --> 03:48:39.399 align:start position:0%
all they'll do is take the private pay
 
03:48:43.149 --> 03:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
so and and and but the real question was
 
03:48:46.030 --> 03:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
about the study committee I mean and and
 
03:48:51.389 --> 03:48:51.399 align:start position:0%
I I I understand so um so the the to
 
03:48:54.349 --> 03:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
have the study committee would be great
 
03:48:57.389 --> 03:48:57.399 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we put it in uh I
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
think though that you know based on what
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
we see with the primary care but let's
 
03:49:06.429 --> 03:49:06.439 align:start position:0%
let's let's take your concern to its
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
full extension let's say that somebody
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
um was to look at a model that says hey
 
03:49:18.910 --> 03:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
you know I think that um there's a
 
03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
market here that we could have you know
 
03:49:23.630 --> 03:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
a high-end nursing home that is going to
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
be you know just direct pay or or
 
03:49:29.189 --> 03:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
whatever um and and and that could that
 
03:49:32.830 --> 03:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
could very well happen the but for your
 
03:49:35.590 --> 03:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
scenario to be realized there would have
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
to be enough of that happening that it's
 
03:49:41.910 --> 03:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to be siphoning off all of the
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
people who um are operating um you know
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
that are going to be C and I just don't
 
03:49:48.910 --> 03:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
think I just don't think that there's
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to be enough um demand that you're
 
03:49:55.550 --> 03:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
going to be seeing 20 nursing homes that
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
are all going to be on a cash pay basis
 
03:50:00.189 --> 03:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
um I I just based on what we're seeing
 
03:50:02.189 --> 03:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
with the direct primary care I I just
 
03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
don't see that that would happen so um
 
03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know based on that I think um there
 
03:50:11.550 --> 03:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
are states for example Oklahoma that
 
03:50:15.389 --> 03:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
that has uh this uh structure
 
03:50:18.429 --> 03:50:18.439 align:start position:0%
with respect to um allowing for the
 
03:50:20.590 --> 03:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
Direct Cash pay model and and we don't
 
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
we just don't see uh uh
 
03:50:27.070 --> 03:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
a a plethora of new nursing homes being
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
built there so it's very limited there's
 
03:50:31.550 --> 03:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
not a lot of states that have this but
 
03:50:33.309 --> 03:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
where it has been applied on a limited
 
03:50:34.870 --> 03:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
basis I'm unaware of everything where
 
03:50:36.630 --> 03:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's just basically you know run away
 
03:50:38.830 --> 03:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
like a chain reaction
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
so other questions representative
 
03:50:45.229 --> 03:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
lontine thank you Mr chair CH thank you
 
03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm sort of
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
following up on um representative
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
Weber's questions
 
03:50:56.910 --> 03:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
because um I see that it's very possible
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
for private nursing homes to open up no
 
03:51:00.319 --> 03:51:01.469 align:start position:0%
for private nursing homes to open up no
red

03:51:01.469 --> 03:51:01.479 align:start position:0%
red
 
03:51:03.550 --> 03:51:03.560 align:start position:0%
tape um and they're going to take
 
03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
everyone that has any
 
03:51:09.309 --> 03:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
money um but eventually for many people
 
03:51:13.229 --> 03:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
that money will run out um as in the
 
03:51:15.429 --> 03:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
case of my mother right now after all
 
03:51:16.790 --> 03:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
the careful
 
03:51:19.550 --> 03:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
planning um or you know someone as we
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
heard testimony this morning someone who
 
03:51:24.510 --> 03:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
is in a nursing home with dementia
 
03:51:27.389 --> 03:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
that's running you know 11 12,000 a
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
month for
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
care so do do you see that there's a
 
03:51:35.710 --> 03:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
possibility that that if this were to
 
03:51:37.710 --> 03:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
happen it would create a scenario where
 
03:51:39.750 --> 03:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's high-end nursing homes for
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
people with money and we're reverting
 
03:51:45.030 --> 03:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
back to basically the poor house for
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:53.030 --> 03:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
money I guess again you know my response
 
03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
to be the same response that I have to
 
03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I there's not a lot
 
03:52:01.710 --> 03:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
of data um if if you look at those few
 
03:52:03.550 --> 03:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
states where they've gone forward with
 
03:52:07.070 --> 03:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
this model we haven't seen that um so I
 
03:52:10.269 --> 03:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
don't I I I don't see that as being a
 
03:52:12.269 --> 03:52:12.279 align:start position:0%
realistic scenario with a small
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
population like we have what I do see it
 
03:52:20.309 --> 03:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
is it's it's an opportunity to um you
 
03:52:22.750 --> 03:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
know bring in transparency and and
 
03:52:26.110 --> 03:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
explore other modes of operation and I
 
03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
think the reality is right
 
03:52:33.910 --> 03:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
now with the model that we have right
 
03:52:38.229 --> 03:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
now um we are seeing access go down
 
03:52:41.110 --> 03:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
especially in the rural regions um the
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
the bill that I'm going to be talking
 
03:52:45.429 --> 03:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
about after this um talks about some of
 
03:52:47.309 --> 03:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
the disparities between the urban and
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
the rural regions um and we have we have
 
03:52:54.030 --> 03:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
had the critical access law and we've
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
had these Provisions we had the
 
03:52:57.790 --> 03:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
certificate of need and then when the
 
03:52:59.710 --> 03:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
certificate of need went away we
 
03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
replaced it in 2016 with what we have
 
03:53:07.269 --> 03:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
now and nothing nothing we have done has
 
03:53:10.830 --> 03:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
gone to e expanding facilities I mean or
 
03:53:13.389 --> 03:53:13.399 align:start position:0%
or or access in fact access has gone
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
down while our population has gone up by
 
03:53:18.910 --> 03:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
close to half a million people so I I I
 
03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
think that if we don't start looking at
 
03:53:25.469 --> 03:53:25.479 align:start position:0%
alternative Solutions now especially
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
where we're getting into aging
 
03:53:29.550 --> 03:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
populations um it it it's going to be
 
03:53:35.349 --> 03:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
too late so um I mean I I I definitely
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
support um going forward with the study
 
03:53:41.710 --> 03:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
I think the study is necessary um but
 
03:53:43.870 --> 03:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
like I said I I think unbalance I think
 
03:53:45.510 --> 03:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
the risk is not not too great and I do
 
03:53:48.149 --> 03:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
have I do have folks coming up after me
 
03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
that are much better subject uh expert
 
03:53:55.349 --> 03:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh speakers on this matter than I am so
 
03:53:57.630 --> 03:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can can uh save that
 
03:53:59.269 --> 03:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
question for them and ask that question
 
03:54:00.790 --> 03:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
because they may have some data
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative that I do not have
 
03:54:06.630 --> 03:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative Paz off thank you Mr
 
03:54:08.590 --> 03:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:54:11.790 --> 03:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
so following up on numbers from previous
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
alimer Services cost like let's say
 
03:54:23.550 --> 03:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
$112,000 but if new facility doesn't
 
03:54:28.030 --> 03:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
have to spend resources on reimbursement
 
03:54:31.710 --> 03:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
negotiations uh and uh some other
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
compliancy uh stuff wouldn't they be
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
able to share some of those savings and
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
lower the cost
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
down well I think I think that they
 
03:54:46.510 --> 03:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
would definitely and the hope would be
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
that you know we would have more
 
03:54:51.910 --> 03:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
offerings and that those people that are
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
operating on that you know cast basis or
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
or uh membership basis would be able to
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
recognize these economies and offer the
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
services at at at a much reduced rate
 
03:55:07.469 --> 03:55:07.479 align:start position:0%
than the $112,000 absolutely that would
 
03:55:10.469 --> 03:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
that would be the Hope um as in terms of
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
the second part of your question I with
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
them sharing some revenues back I don't
 
03:55:16.229 --> 03:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
think that that would kind of defeat the
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
purpose I don't know if that was what
 
03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
you were asking for the second part of
 
03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:20.349 align:start position:0%
you were asking for the second part of
your

03:55:20.349 --> 03:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
question okay anyone else representative
 
03:55:26.349 --> 03:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
Nel thank you Mr chair thank for taking
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
my question anyways
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
um I've been in medicine for a long time
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
um I've seen that the concept I think
 
03:55:36.830 --> 03:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
that representative Weber was alluding
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
to is called cherry-picking and it's a
 
03:55:40.910 --> 03:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
very real phenomenon that actually led
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
to the creation of Medicare and Medicaid
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
03:55:46.950 --> 03:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
um I do think that there's the potential
 
03:55:50.349 --> 03:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
for this to happen um you know with that
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
said very early in my career um the
 
03:55:54.149 --> 03:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
American Bar Association American
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
Medical Association both said that we as
 
03:55:59.189 --> 03:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
providers have a responsibility to take
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
care of 10% of the population at least
 
03:56:03.110 --> 03:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
10% of our time should be spent taking
 
03:56:05.429 --> 03:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
care of the poor so what I'm wondering
 
03:56:07.469 --> 03:56:07.479 align:start position:0%
is if in a bill like this to minimize
 
03:56:09.389 --> 03:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
the cherry-picking effect you can
 
03:56:11.070 --> 03:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
include language that they would be
 
03:56:13.590 --> 03:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
expected to devote a certain percentage
 
03:56:15.389 --> 03:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
of their resource is to taking care of
 
03:56:17.030 --> 03:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
the poor either through Medicaid like
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise so you're saying facilities
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
that would exist under this rubric would
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
be uh I think I mean if there was a
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
certain component of of that that was
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
potentially charitable uh but I think if
 
03:56:42.429 --> 03:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
you were to go and say no we expect you
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
to take 10% of your population you know
 
03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid or whatever what that
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
would do would be basically put you back
 
03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
into the same thing representative Neo
 
03:56:55.950 --> 03:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about this morning
 
03:56:58.349 --> 03:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
where you I I I still have to build up
 
03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and and all those
 
03:57:02.830 --> 03:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
things so I think you know if you were
 
03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
looking at you know we the expectation
 
03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
is that we have some kind of charitable
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
component maybe um you know and we could
 
03:57:12.790 --> 03:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
have some discussions about that but if
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
it was oh you're going to have 10% has
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
to be Medicare or Medicaid now it kind
 
03:57:19.750 --> 03:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
of defeats the whole point of it because
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
now you're you're going to have to come
 
03:57:24.910 --> 03:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
and rebuild in that infrastructure so um
 
03:57:26.830 --> 03:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
I I think at least that's where I'm on
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
but but I'm open to
 
03:57:32.670 --> 03:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
discussion other discussion other
 
03:57:45.070 --> 03:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is former
 
03:58:10.110 --> 03:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:12.790 --> 03:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
kerk Thank you Mr chair and for the
 
03:58:15.229 --> 03:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
record yes my name is Jerry kerk retired
 
03:58:18.429 --> 03:58:18.439 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgeon and legislator and
 
03:58:20.030 --> 03:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here uh again I was a little
 
03:58:21.229 --> 03:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
confused earlier because there was a lot
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
of comment about critical access
 
03:58:23.990 --> 03:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals which this bill does not have
 
03:58:26.189 --> 03:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
to do with but that's the next one um
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm here to testify against just
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
section four of HB 548 because that
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
section would exempt nursing homes
 
03:58:33.149 --> 03:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
skilled nursing facilities Intermediate
 
03:58:34.910 --> 03:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
Care Facilities rehab hospitals and
 
03:58:36.630 --> 03:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
Facilities which operate on the
 
03:58:38.349 --> 03:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
membership model or exclusiv they
 
03:58:40.189 --> 03:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
provide services on a basis of direct
 
03:58:41.990 --> 03:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
payment from the patient without any
 
03:58:42.000 --> 03:58:43.030 align:start position:0%
payment from the patient without any
thirdparty

03:58:43.030 --> 03:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
thirdparty
 
03:58:45.349 --> 03:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from the requirement for
 
03:58:46.830 --> 03:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
licensed Healthcare facilities to
 
03:58:48.429 --> 03:58:48.439 align:start position:0%
provide services to all persons
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of the source of
 
03:58:54.510 --> 03:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
payment okay you all sit on County
 
03:58:56.590 --> 03:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
delegations and you should be familiar
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
with the finances of your County nursing
 
03:59:00.670 --> 03:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
home that's where most people actually
 
03:59:02.229 --> 03:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
finally you know understand how this
 
03:59:05.309 --> 03:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
stuff works Medicaid covers about 60% of
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
nursing home residents but the
 
03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate of Medicaid is
 
03:59:10.990 --> 03:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than the actual cost
 
03:59:14.149 --> 03:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
of nursing home care so nursing homes
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
rely on the revenue from self-pay
 
03:59:18.790 --> 03:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
patients and patients with insurance to
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
make up that
 
03:59:22.830 --> 03:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
shortfall so what's the problem with
 
03:59:25.830 --> 03:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
allowing some facilities to only accept
 
03:59:28.229 --> 03:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
cash or members well first of all
 
03:59:30.910 --> 03:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
healthc care simply does not function as
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
a free
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
market it's a basic human need healthc
 
03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
care is not a luxury consumer good where
 
03:59:40.030 --> 03:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
if the cost is too high you can just not
 
03:59:40.040 --> 03:59:41.469 align:start position:0%
if the cost is too high you can just not
buy

03:59:41.469 --> 03:59:41.479 align:start position:0%
buy
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
it you we use most of us can afford to
 
03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
pay the cost ourselves so if you're 80
 
03:59:49.070 --> 03:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
years old and you just sustained a major
 
03:59:50.910 --> 03:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
injury or illness or had major surgery
 
03:59:53.229 --> 03:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
and cannot function independent home and
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
need Rehabilitation or a nursing
 
03:59:58.469 --> 03:59:58.479 align:start position:0%
facility you can't just say well no that
 
04:00:00.149 --> 04:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
product's too expensive I don't want to
 
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
buy it that's not a choice you're stuck
 
04:00:04.469 --> 04:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to go and somebody
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
else is going to have to pick up the
 
04:00:07.389 --> 04:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
bill and that's what we see in the
 
04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
County nursing home with uninsured
 
04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so on and so forth now again
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
the proponents of this approach often
 
04:00:15.269 --> 04:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
state that just allows the free market
 
04:00:15.279 --> 04:00:16.269 align:start position:0%
state that just allows the free market
to

04:00:16.269 --> 04:00:16.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
function however the free market also
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
Demands a Level Playing Field and I that
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
quite interesting that when
 
04:00:24.910 --> 04:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative mlan was asked about well
 
04:00:27.149 --> 04:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
what about having a 10% of the people
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
would have to be charity care and he
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
said well that put us back in the same
 
04:00:33.750 --> 04:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
place yes it would level the playing
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
field which is not what he wants because
 
04:00:39.309 --> 04:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
HB 548 would allow that small number of
 
04:00:41.910 --> 04:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
for-profit Institutions to cherry-pick
 
04:00:44.670 --> 04:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
the healthy uncomplicated ated patients
 
04:00:47.670 --> 04:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
who can pay full cash price that shifts
 
04:00:49.710 --> 04:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
the care of the sicker more expensive
 
04:00:52.110 --> 04:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
patients and those with Medicaid the
 
04:00:55.590 --> 04:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
uninsured or insurances that pay less to
 
04:00:56.550 --> 04:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:00:58.990 --> 04:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
facilities they're still subject to RSA
 
04:01:02.070 --> 04:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
1212 F and that leads to adverse fiscal
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
impact on those facilities and possible
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
closure of those facilities this bill
 
04:01:10.429 --> 04:01:10.439 align:start position:0%
creates an unlevel playing field that
 
04:01:12.630 --> 04:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
sets regular facilities at a
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
disadvantage compared to these private
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
ones so in summary for profit facilities
 
04:01:19.590 --> 04:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
cherry-picking the well-paying
 
04:01:21.870 --> 04:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
uncomplicated patients would have
 
04:01:23.790 --> 04:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
significant economic impact on our
 
04:01:26.269 --> 04:01:26.279 align:start position:0%
regular facilities the loss is sustained
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
by those facilities would just be
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
shifted to those who have insurance or
 
04:01:31.469 --> 04:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
in the case of the nursing home the
 
04:01:33.870 --> 04:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
County nursing home to the taxpayers
 
04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
driving up costs for everyone else and
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
not changing total health care costs the
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
bottom line is I believe that the goal
 
04:01:41.550 --> 04:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
for the Health Care System should be to
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
provide Health Care
 
04:01:46.149 --> 04:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
not to provide profits from caring for
 
04:01:48.429 --> 04:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
the wealthy while letting those who are
 
04:01:51.630 --> 04:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
less fortunate suffer and die please itl
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'd be glad to take any
 
04:01:56.070 --> 04:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
wber thank you and good to see you
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
again my
 
04:02:03.870 --> 04:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
pleasure so you stated that you opposed
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
section four because of the County
 
04:02:07.229 --> 04:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home issue does that mean that
 
04:02:10.110 --> 04:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
you also
 
04:02:14.149 --> 04:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
oppose um section one which is also
 
04:02:16.469 --> 04:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
about residential care and health
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
facility licensing well I mean it
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
exempts from the moratory and actually
 
04:02:24.269 --> 04:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
it's not just the County nursing homes
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
too it's like any any U regular nursing
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
home would be potentially bothered and
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes I would I would also agree but um
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to focus on that cost
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
shifting uh issue but I think that it is
 
04:02:38.590 --> 04:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
a problem to say oh sure if you want to
 
04:02:41.110 --> 04:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
make this one that can just cater to
 
04:02:42.750 --> 04:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
well-off patients you can build it but
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
for the rest of you you can't so yes I
 
04:02:46.870 --> 04:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
would oppose one but I because of time I
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
was trying to keep myself focused and
 
04:02:51.510 --> 04:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
I'll just follow I'll just ask one more
 
04:02:55.469 --> 04:02:55.479 align:start position:0%
question which is um do do you have a
 
04:02:59.550 --> 04:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
concern that if people are able to pay
 
04:03:01.469 --> 04:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
the costs of a nursing home which are
 
04:03:05.070 --> 04:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
steep they also might prefer not to be
 
04:03:07.229 --> 04:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
housed in a nursing home where there are
 
04:03:09.229 --> 04:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's patients who might be
 
04:03:11.550 --> 04:03:11.560 align:start position:0%
difficult and bariatric patients who
 
04:03:14.750 --> 04:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
might take up nurses time and
 
04:03:17.870 --> 04:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh otherwise difficult and unmanageable
 
04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
or more difficult to manage
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
patients yes um in a sense okay here's
 
04:03:27.670 --> 04:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
an example it's the country club or the
 
04:03:29.790 --> 04:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
public golf course you know do you want
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
to be with the Riff ra or do you want to
 
04:03:32.950 --> 04:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
just be with with people of your own
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status it'd be nice to be
 
04:03:37.030 --> 04:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
the other way around and if we had a
 
04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
billing you know remember many other
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
countries in the world solve this
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
problem by not having insurance they
 
04:03:47.389 --> 04:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
just you know Elder Care is simply
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
something that they do in the Nordic
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
countries being one of the best examples
 
04:03:51.790 --> 04:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
of that and they don't have to fight
 
04:03:54.750 --> 04:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
with all this stuff um I think the other
 
04:03:56.670 --> 04:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
thing that was brought up was that
 
04:03:57.870 --> 04:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
question of what happens when they run
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
out so is that person just going to get
 
04:04:01.750 --> 04:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
booted out on the street oh time to send
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
them to the County nursing home now
 
04:04:04.750 --> 04:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
because they haven't got any money we've
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
sucked it all out so now it's time to
 
04:04:09.630 --> 04:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
send them away that's the feeling I get
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
from this bill I know that's not the
 
04:04:13.229 --> 04:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
intention uh representative mlan is a
 
04:04:14.429 --> 04:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
good guy
 
04:04:15.790 --> 04:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think this is his intention at
 
04:04:17.469 --> 04:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
all but this is still what I think will
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
be the
 
04:04:21.790 --> 04:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
outcome representative Nan thank you Mr
 
04:04:23.950 --> 04:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question this
 
04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
is kind of like
 
04:04:28.349 --> 04:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
a it's not a nebulous question but it's
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
pertinent I mean it it it brings to the
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
mind question of how we in our society
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
view Health Care in general um is it a
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
public good is it a pseudo public good
 
04:04:41.070 --> 04:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
is a private good I meant to ask this
 
04:04:42.870 --> 04:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
question of Representative mlan but I
 
04:04:44.590 --> 04:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
just curious words where you put it
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
because that has dramatic ramifications
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
for public policy and how we create
 
04:04:51.349 --> 04:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
things is how we visualize that answer
 
04:04:53.389 --> 04:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
well I think my final comment kind of
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
gave my sense about that I believe that
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
it is a public good it is actually a
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental human right to be able to
 
04:05:04.149 --> 04:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
access health care and I do not think
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
again that the that it functions as a
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
free market we heard earlier today about
 
04:05:09.630 --> 04:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of finding prices and no
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
matter what we do about it as long as we
 
04:05:12.750 --> 04:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
have a system of insurances it's going
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
to be opaque nebulous and difficult and
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
I think that um it just simply doesn't
 
04:05:21.309 --> 04:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
function the comment I keep making all
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
the time is you I remember when the
 
04:05:25.389 --> 04:05:25.399 align:start position:0%
iPhone first came out I thought it was
 
04:05:26.830 --> 04:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
really cool I actually know the Apple
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
watch really cool but it cost too much
 
04:05:29.910 --> 04:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
money I didn't want it I could make that
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
decision but if you're lying on a
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
stretcher and you've got a cute
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
appendicitis or a ruptured appendix
 
04:05:36.429 --> 04:05:36.439 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to start
 
04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
looking around for a better deal for
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
who's going to do rap indomy and you
 
04:05:41.630 --> 04:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
can't say I think I'll just skip it
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
because it's just too expensive health
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
healthare doesn't function like a
 
04:05:49.389 --> 04:05:49.399 align:start position:0%
consumer good it's not a commodity it is
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
a fundamental human
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
right other
 
04:06:00.189 --> 04:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:02.790 --> 04:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Greg
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
Prosperity thank you Mr chairman members
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee always great to be back
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
in my old stomping grounds I know
 
04:06:15.670 --> 04:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative McKay is the only one
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
left in the committee but but I do
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
always appreciate coming here uh for the
 
04:06:20.510 --> 04:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
record my name is Greg Mo Regional
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
director for Americans for Prosperity
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
here today to testify in support of
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill 548 House Bill 548 gets at
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
the fundamental problem of the third
 
04:06:31.389 --> 04:06:31.399 align:start position:0%
party payer uh third party Payment
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
Systems drive up the cost of care and uh
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
block the relationship between between
 
04:06:39.389 --> 04:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
provider and patient and this bill is
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
trying to is trying to do one small
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
piece to to get it as the sponsor said
 
04:06:46.469 --> 04:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
there's not a huge Market the vast
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
majority of granted Staters either have
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
employer sponsor insurance or have
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
government insurance and so it's a very
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
small pool but it is growing I'll try to
 
04:06:57.149 --> 04:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
get to that uh I'll just say this bill's
 
04:06:58.510 --> 04:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
passed passed the house a couple times
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
in the last few years so I don't want to
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh bring rehash too much of what I've
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
said in the past on this legislation but
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
the third party payment system based
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
upon some studies has shown to increase
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of Care by about 35% removing
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
that thirdparty payment problem
 
04:07:15.550 --> 04:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
that you we have the opportunity to
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
provide uh lower cost lower cost
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
alternatives for individuals across New
 
04:07:22.110 --> 04:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I will say that there was
 
04:07:25.149 --> 04:07:25.159 align:start position:0%
there was a a group trade group of of uh
 
04:07:26.950 --> 04:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
independent Physicians they recommended
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
just to understand the scope of this
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
that for every independent physician you
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
should have two billing Specialists so
 
04:07:34.510 --> 04:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
you can imagine the cost that that adds
 
04:07:37.149 --> 04:07:37.159 align:start position:0%
on top of of care uh I'd like to say
 
04:07:39.550 --> 04:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
there's a little more urgency this year
 
04:07:42.750 --> 04:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh as many of you may know back in 2010
 
04:07:44.149 --> 04:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
with the affordable Care Act they
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
created marketplaces or exchanges and
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
those exchanges offered uh subsidies
 
04:07:51.149 --> 04:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
called uh Advanced premium tax credits
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
for people up to 400% well in the early
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
2001 uh 2021 uh the American uh was
 
04:08:00.109 --> 04:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
American Rescue plan lifted lifted that
 
04:08:02.269 --> 04:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
cap so there's no cap you could get
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
these Advanced premium tax credits uh
 
04:08:05.950 --> 04:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
that was extended two years it was
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
extended another two years and the
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act but it goes away
 
04:08:11.229 --> 04:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
at the end of this year and according to
 
04:08:13.990 --> 04:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
CBO a study that the CBO did for Senator
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
Shaheen it's going to lead to 3.8
 
04:08:17.910 --> 04:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
million more people who will not have
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
health insurance now these will be
 
04:08:21.429 --> 04:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
people whose heal whose incomes are
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
above 400% of the federal property Li
 
04:08:26.149 --> 04:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
limit which is 62,6 for an individual
 
04:08:32.830 --> 04:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
and just smash it into New Hampshire our
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
share would be about 12 or 13,000 people
 
04:08:39.630 --> 04:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
so we're potentially looking at having a
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
significant number of people who don't
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
have traditional health insurance we're
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
going to be looking for lower lower cost
 
04:08:46.870 --> 04:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and House Bill 548 would
 
04:08:49.229 --> 04:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
help get us there so uh in the interest
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
of time I'll stop there and and just uh
 
04:08:53.229 --> 04:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
say I'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
you got 20 seconds to spare very good
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Woods um
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:09:04.349 --> 04:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm not being a
 
04:09:07.630 --> 04:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
economist or a actuary or anything like
 
04:09:11.309 --> 04:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
that that helped me understand how
 
04:09:13.870 --> 04:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
creating with this bill
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
basically where you mentioned third
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
party payers basically creating a
 
04:09:17.840 --> 04:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
party payers basically creating a
fourth-party

04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.229 --> 04:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
payer in essence I'm not sure I
 
04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
understand well where because You' be
 
04:09:27.389 --> 04:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
paying directly to I understand but
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
there there you know there's but that's
 
04:09:32.309 --> 04:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
another mode of
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
payment okay well I mean I I I I I
 
04:09:37.469 --> 04:09:37.479 align:start position:0%
definitely understand what you're saying
 
04:09:39.870 --> 04:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
to the question sorry is that's really
 
04:09:42.109 --> 04:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
basically putting it in a market based
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
which uh and I I guess I have trouble
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
understanding as has been outlined by Dr
 
04:09:52.349 --> 04:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
kerk uh that it it really doesn't fit
 
04:09:55.950 --> 04:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
our overall concept other other than a
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
business model and um we're we're trying
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
to get away from a business model it
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
seemed like this is getting us farther
 
04:10:05.550 --> 04:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
into that perspective but help me out if
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'm really looking at this incorrectly
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
sure uh this actually creates a more
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
traditional relationship as you would go
 
04:10:15.790 --> 04:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
to any any uh any vendor so when you go
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
to the store to buy to buy groceries you
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
pay them at once you buy the groceries
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh it would be a very similar
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
relationship you just pay pay for the
 
04:10:26.670 --> 04:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
services once it's provided so it's a it
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
removes the third party pay payment
 
04:10:30.670 --> 04:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
system and uh I I might add a couple
 
04:10:32.469 --> 04:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
other issues that I'd like to to raise I
 
04:10:34.269 --> 04:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
know that that was brought up in an
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony the issue of nursing
 
04:10:37.710 --> 04:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
homes well we have a nursing home
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
moratorium right now we we I started
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
working at HHS in 2003 and we have we
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
haven't built the new incremental
 
04:10:45.309 --> 04:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
nursing home bed since then because of
 
04:10:47.349 --> 04:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
the moratorium so that's already in
 
04:10:49.309 --> 04:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
place the second one I'd like to address
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nagel's question um if
 
04:10:55.469 --> 04:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
you look at page two of the bill and
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
lines uh four and five you'll note that
 
04:10:58.720 --> 04:10:59.469 align:start position:0%
lines uh four and five you'll note that
in

04:10:59.469 --> 04:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:11:02.189 --> 04:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
Statute in the statute in the existing
 
04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
statute um there you do have to have a
 
04:11:07.870 --> 04:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
plan for for uninsured
 
04:11:10.590 --> 04:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
patients so lines four and page two
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
lines four and five so that part is not
 
04:11:18.510 --> 04:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.469 --> 04:11:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
lamante uh thank you Mr chair well maybe
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it this wrong but it seems
 
04:11:33.710 --> 04:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
to me that on line 12 it's saying that
 
04:11:36.510 --> 04:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
um in the case of the nursing
 
04:11:39.429 --> 04:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
home A and B would not apply they would
 
04:11:42.630 --> 04:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
be exempt from having to cover the
 
04:11:42.640 --> 04:11:44.590 align:start position:0%
be exempt from having to cover the
uninsured

04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
uninsured
 
04:11:46.910 --> 04:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I yeah no I I I think that that's
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
probably a I think you could probably
 
04:11:52.149 --> 04:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
just keep keep be in if if this
 
04:11:52.159 --> 04:11:55.710 align:start position:0%
just keep keep be in if if this
committee's

04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
desire and just follow up yes thank you
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
um but with regard to efficiency you're
 
04:12:05.950 --> 04:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
saying that this bill would really by
 
04:12:07.710 --> 04:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the third party would
 
04:12:11.950 --> 04:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
really open up efficiency um I agree
 
04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
that if we didn't have quite so many
 
04:12:17.109 --> 04:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
private insurers things would be a lot
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
more efficient like Medicare for example
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
their overhead is only about 3% compared
 
04:12:26.189 --> 04:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
to private insurance which you know is
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
anywhere to 12 to
 
04:12:32.910 --> 04:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
20% so do you consider that maybe having
 
04:12:35.950 --> 04:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
a Single Payer program like opening up
 
04:12:38.830 --> 04:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare that would include long-term
 
04:12:41.790 --> 04:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
insurance would be a tremendous um
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
efficiency savings for nursing homes
 
04:12:46.510 --> 04:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
because then you wouldn't need Medicaid
 
04:12:48.990 --> 04:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
at all well at the potential trade-off
 
04:12:51.269 --> 04:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
of for example rationing of care and
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
things we've seen in other nations that
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
do that um it's particularly disturbing
 
04:12:57.630 --> 04:12:57.640 align:start position:0%
I've seen some of the things coming out
 
04:13:00.510 --> 04:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
of Canada where they're at trying to
 
04:13:02.590 --> 04:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
euthanize people on a regular basis I
 
04:13:04.030 --> 04:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a troubling troubling
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
concern no no it's a thing um and uh I
 
04:13:10.750 --> 04:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
think there's a reason why uh people
 
04:13:13.109 --> 04:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
come to America for our care people
 
04:13:14.630 --> 04:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
people travel from across the globe to
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
America for our care and part of the
 
04:13:18.990 --> 04:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
reason why we have that uniquely is
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
because we because of the payment system
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
that we do offer uh allows centers of
 
04:13:27.389 --> 04:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
excellence to flourish whereas whereas
 
04:13:29.710 --> 04:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
in these other countries you see it's
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
the the care is spread out over the
 
04:13:34.149 --> 04:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.550 --> 04:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
country representative Nagel I I just I
 
04:13:39.149 --> 04:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
guess I want to just oh thanks Mr
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks a little having spent
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
over a hundred last year on creating a
 
04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
prior authorization bill I guess my
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
question is do we not already have
 
04:13:52.030 --> 04:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
rationing of care in this
 
04:13:54.990 --> 04:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
country not not necessarily at the
 
04:13:55.000 --> 04:13:56.309 align:start position:0%
country not not necessarily at the
provider

04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
level um from a payment level we
 
04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
do there's nothing stopping you from
 
04:14:05.149 --> 04:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
getting that care there's nothing
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
stopping you from getting that DM
 
04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
there's nothing stopping you from
 
04:14:11.309 --> 04:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
getting that drug it's the third party
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
payment system that's cre in that
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
barrier in between the
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
two other
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.590 --> 04:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Ben
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.630 --> 04:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
Association thanks Mr chairman and
 
04:14:44.590 --> 04:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
members of of the committee my name is
 
04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
Ben Bradley I represent all acute care
 
04:14:48.670 --> 04:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New Hampshire and all
 
04:14:50.590 --> 04:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
specialty hospitals through the New
 
04:14:52.910 --> 04:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association we are
 
04:14:55.469 --> 04:14:55.479 align:start position:0%
opposed to HB
 
04:14:57.870 --> 04:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
548 uh we have concerns that this bill
 
04:14:59.710 --> 04:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
could impede access to Services of a
 
04:15:01.710 --> 04:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
health care facility is not required to
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
have a charity care policy this bill
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
bifurcates the Health Care System into
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
two classes of patients and sets up a
 
04:15:10.590 --> 04:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework that treats
 
04:15:12.349 --> 04:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
facilities differently based on whether
 
04:15:15.389 --> 04:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
a patient direct pays it also appears
 
04:15:16.830 --> 04:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
that facilities licensed with a
 
04:15:19.109 --> 04:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
membership based business model would
 
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
not have to follow center for Medicare
 
04:15:23.070 --> 04:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid services conditions of
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
participation which include important
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
patient safety and quality
 
04:15:30.109 --> 04:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
requirements the way we read the bill a
 
04:15:31.750 --> 04:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
healthc care facility licensed as a
 
04:15:33.870 --> 04:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
membership based business model could
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
discriminate against individuals because
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
of the individual's inability to pay a
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
membership fee we do not believe this is
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the patient
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
seeking care in these facilities do
 
04:15:48.670 --> 04:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
not to not be assured that the facility
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
will treat them regardless of their
 
04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
ability to pay Additionally the bill
 
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
sets up two separate Patient Bill of
 
04:15:58.269 --> 04:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
Rights the existing Patient Bill of
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
Rights and the one established under
 
04:16:00.600 --> 04:16:01.870 align:start position:0%
Rights and the one established under
this

04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
bill this creates uh confusion for
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
patients seeking Care at facilities that
 
04:16:10.229 --> 04:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
offer the same or similar Services
 
04:16:12.990 --> 04:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
specifically I'll give you my testimony
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
but I want to point out a couple of
 
04:16:19.710 --> 04:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
items Roman 5 on page three line 14 does
 
04:16:22.349 --> 04:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
not include no patient shall be
 
04:16:25.229 --> 04:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
involuntarily discharged from a facility
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
because the patient becomes eligible for
 
04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid as a source of payment this
 
04:16:32.550 --> 04:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
speaks to the exact scenario that the
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative pointed out earlier and
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's intentionally left
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
out Additionally the patient Bill of
 
04:16:42.030 --> 04:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
Rights established under this bill does
 
04:16:44.149 --> 04:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
not include
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
under Roman uh does not include the
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
under the existing Patient Bill of
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
Rights Roman 20 where it states the
 
04:16:54.189 --> 04:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
patient shall not be denied admission to
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
a facility based on Medicaid as a source
 
04:16:58.990 --> 04:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
of payment when there is an available
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
space in the
 
04:17:04.830 --> 04:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
facility two other examples Roman 22 of
 
04:17:06.910 --> 04:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
the existing Patient Bill of
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
Rights indicates that the patient shall
 
04:17:11.950 --> 04:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
not be denied admission care or Services
 
04:17:14.950 --> 04:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
based solely on the patients vaccination
 
04:17:18.870 --> 04:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
status and finally on Roman 23 relative
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
to a patient's right to have a visitor
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
which was
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
recently enacted as
 
04:17:28.149 --> 04:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
well we don't believe that this bill is
 
04:17:29.870 --> 04:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
an appropriate model for licensed
 
04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire and we ask
 
04:17:33.870 --> 04:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
that you find it in expedient to
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you for the opportunity
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
to provide comments and happy to take
 
04:17:40.830 --> 04:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Nagel
 
04:17:42.550 --> 04:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
question you brought up a lot of really
 
04:17:45.550 --> 04:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
neat points because I did go over all
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights and had a lot of
 
04:17:48.830 --> 04:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
concerns about the differences between
 
04:17:51.630 --> 04:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
the two but between your testimony and
 
04:17:53.189 --> 04:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
the last testimony it sounds like
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
there's contradictions in this bill that
 
04:17:58.510 --> 04:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
need to be reconciled in terms of of um
 
04:18:00.750 --> 04:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
whether someone with or without those uh
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
forms of payment can be involved or not
 
04:18:04.910 --> 04:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
or how they got rid of am I wrong or is
 
04:18:07.710 --> 04:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
that accurate did you read it um uh
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
respectfully I would stick to my final
 
04:18:10.870 --> 04:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
statement which is to request the bill
 
04:18:14.910 --> 04:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:14.920 --> 04:18:16.950 align:start position:0%
 
other

04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:26.670 --> 04:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Nick bis
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Nick veis I'm
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
the CEO and founder of the Bedford
 
04:18:52.510 --> 04:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
ambulatory Surgical Center uh started 32
 
04:18:56.349 --> 04:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
years ago and uh when we opened up the
 
04:18:58.429 --> 04:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
sky was going to fall hospitals would go
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
out of business and um all hell would
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
break break out so uh and I'm proud to
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
tell you that um that didn't happen and
 
04:19:11.590 --> 04:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
there was greater access and
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
affordability to health
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
care I'm not here either to support or
 
04:19:21.269 --> 04:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
kabash the uh the proposed Bill I'm here
 
04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
to just bring out some highlights that
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
you should all be thinking about I've
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
been providing healthc care for 40 years
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh I've been in private practice I
 
04:19:33.389 --> 04:19:33.399 align:start position:0%
develop surgical centers imaging centers
 
04:19:37.630 --> 04:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
labs and uh I own physician practices
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
one recently in a North Country in
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
colbrook and so I've worn many hats had
 
04:19:45.269 --> 04:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
my own insurance company your former
 
04:19:46.510 --> 04:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
04:19:50.349 --> 04:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
Services so I've paid bills as a uh uh
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
as a state employee Healthcare bills
 
04:19:56.349 --> 04:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
that is um I've been a patient and a
 
04:19:59.710 --> 04:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
provider so with all that being said
 
04:20:02.309 --> 04:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
remember this as you develop policy
 
04:20:05.469 --> 04:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
leading cause of personal bankruptcy is
 
04:20:05.479 --> 04:20:06.429 align:start position:0%
leading cause of personal bankruptcy is
Health

04:20:06.429 --> 04:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
Health
 
04:20:09.870 --> 04:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
Care think about that you get sick and
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
injured and all of a sudden we kick you
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
and this country we kick you while
 
04:20:19.109 --> 04:20:19.119 align:start position:0%
you're down um by bankrupting you that's
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
awful we can do better than
 
04:20:26.429 --> 04:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire offers a lot of
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that are far lower in price
 
04:20:31.389 --> 04:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
point in our neighboring states because
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
we got rid of the co law most of it
 
04:20:38.830 --> 04:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
remember that don't discard free market
 
04:20:41.710 --> 04:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
forces or an informed patient or
 
04:20:41.720 --> 04:20:44.070 align:start position:0%
forces or an informed patient or
consumer

04:20:44.070 --> 04:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
04:20:45.550 --> 04:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
but what's being presented and talked
 
04:20:47.630 --> 04:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
about as a broad brush
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
here are you talking about nursing home
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
care then you're talking about lab
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
services I also started the one of the
 
04:20:58.349 --> 04:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
leading Healthcare cost transparency
 
04:21:01.309 --> 04:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
companies in America today Compass smart
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
Shopper I think there are 93 million
 
04:21:08.109 --> 04:21:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
it people need to know what things
 
04:21:13.870 --> 04:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
cost if they're going to use those
 
04:21:16.590 --> 04:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
resources we should be creating some
 
04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
natural checks and balances so that
 
04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
there is some competition amongst
 
04:21:24.109 --> 04:21:24.119 align:start position:0%
providers but there are times in your
 
04:21:26.269 --> 04:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
life where you you don't have any
 
04:21:29.790 --> 04:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
choice I know we could do a lot better
 
04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
with a
 
04:21:34.550 --> 04:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
blend of what you're all talking
 
04:21:37.870 --> 04:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
about I mean Physician Offices Lab
 
04:21:40.269 --> 04:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
Services you know you can pay as little
 
04:21:42.630 --> 04:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
as $15
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
in a physician's office or
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
lab I can offer state-of-the-art MRI CAT
 
04:21:58.469 --> 04:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
scan services for $400 to $5500 versus
 
04:22:01.149 --> 04:22:01.159 align:start position:0%

$70,000 in the same
 
04:22:19.950 --> 04:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
Marketplace half of the employers today
 
04:22:21.750 --> 04:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
are self-insured they're paying the
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
claim dollar for
 
04:22:27.790 --> 04:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
them please consider those factors but I
 
04:22:33.389 --> 04:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
would also agree that someone at the end
 
04:22:35.550 --> 04:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
end stage of their life that they
 
04:22:37.710 --> 04:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be on a street we can do
 
04:22:39.389 --> 04:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
better and for those of you who are
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
looking at a single-payer system just
 
04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
because you now have coverage doesn't
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
mean you're going to get the
 
04:22:47.910 --> 04:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
care remember
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
you any questions so representative
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
Nagel and then representative kof thank
 
04:22:55.630 --> 04:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
question I could have paid you to say
 
04:22:59.830 --> 04:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
what you said about catastrophic health
 
04:23:01.109 --> 04:23:01.119 align:start position:0%
problems because I've been doing it for
 
04:23:03.630 --> 04:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
the last 35 years and it is devastating
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's not my question can you
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
do me I do me a favor and describe to me
 
04:23:11.109 --> 04:23:11.119 align:start position:0%
what Bedford ambulatory Surgical Center
 
04:23:13.349 --> 04:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
is and how it was created because it's
 
04:23:15.309 --> 04:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
my impression it's more of a Cooperative
 
04:23:17.229 --> 04:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
Venture than it's kind of its own out in
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
the oh no field type thing am I wrong no
 
04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
it it it was started by a small group of
 
04:23:29.070 --> 04:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgeons and myself and and
 
04:23:33.309 --> 04:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
there were no and and you know uh I
 
04:23:34.870 --> 04:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
didn't know I didn't know anything about
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
ulatory surgery and but it was um The
 
04:23:41.149 --> 04:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
Physicians needed to be more efficient
 
04:23:42.630 --> 04:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
with their time they were losing near
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
block time and they didn't have any
 
04:23:46.990 --> 04:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
control of their schedule and some
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
orthopedist surgeons in out in
 
04:23:50.510 --> 04:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
California were doing our patient
 
04:23:54.790 --> 04:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
surgery and so they came to me because I
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
they thought I had an understanding of
 
04:23:59.550 --> 04:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
medical business so anyways we went off
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
and did it on our own we struggled for
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
the first couple years and we started
 
04:24:05.309 --> 04:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
out with six surgeons and now we have 35
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
surgeon Partners but we partnered with a
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
hospital we partnered with
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
CMC but we were a position of strength
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
to partner with and every physician I've
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
been work with cares you all care and
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
you know you you shouldn't have the
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
mentality that you want it all you have
 
04:24:25.830 --> 04:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
to do it all and so with that we came up
 
04:24:26.670 --> 04:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
with a
 
04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
great facility and 32 years later it's
 
04:24:33.870 --> 04:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
still around strong and uh it's offering
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
the best price Poss surgical price
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
possible in our community representative
 
04:24:41.429 --> 04:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
Kwal thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:24:45.630 --> 04:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions so um you know I
 
04:24:47.550 --> 04:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh there are a number
 
04:24:49.710 --> 04:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
of success stories from other states
 
04:24:51.870 --> 04:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
like the surgical center of
 
04:24:54.510 --> 04:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma and understanding that the
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
current law which requires multiple um
 
04:25:01.590 --> 04:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
basically requires you to AC accept all
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
forms of payment dates back to
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
2016 so you you were in this market well
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
before then um did you did you see a
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
problem before 2016 with um complaints
 
04:25:21.309 --> 04:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
about you know sort of drawing away the
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
I guess the profitable customers or the
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
the best uh the patients who could
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
afford to pay more was there was there a
 
04:25:31.149 --> 04:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
problem before 2016 yes there's always
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
been a problem obviously you know um
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be a pro it's a
 
04:25:38.990 --> 04:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
complex issue and and it's an economic
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
issue you may not know there are three
 
04:25:43.309 --> 04:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
different payments of
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that exists for health
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
care providers
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
three Medicare puts out three there's a
 
04:25:52.189 --> 04:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
hospital rate three for the same service
 
04:25:55.109 --> 04:25:55.119 align:start position:0%
but mind you okay there's a hospital
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
rate there's a hospital patient
 
04:25:59.550 --> 04:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
Department rate and then is an
 
04:26:03.389 --> 04:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
independent of patient entity
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
rate the hospital rate for the same
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
service compared to the independent rate
 
04:26:09.950 --> 04:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
often times is
 
04:26:13.870 --> 04:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
5X 5X
 
04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay and often times if someone doesn't
 
04:26:18.269 --> 04:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
have any responsibility because they're
 
04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
in their Federal program they're going
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
to go to the hospital for they go to the
 
04:26:23.469 --> 04:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
hospital for an
 
04:26:23.479 --> 04:26:25.229 align:start position:0%
hospital for an
earache

04:26:25.229 --> 04:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
earache
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
okay that that system needs to change so
 
04:26:31.750 --> 04:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
it it complicates the problems every
 
04:26:34.189 --> 04:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
physician I have ever worked with and I
 
04:26:36.309 --> 04:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
today have about 90 surgeon
 
04:26:40.070 --> 04:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
Partners they all care they they don't
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
they take care of everybody
 
04:26:45.149 --> 04:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
okay and we do our best as well as a
 
04:26:48.070 --> 04:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
facility no one is scamming the system
 
04:26:50.510 --> 04:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
or cherry-picking such on a regular
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
basis all right so um that is not the
 
04:26:56.790 --> 04:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
issue they said that about ambulatory
 
04:27:00.269 --> 04:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
surgical centers in New Hampshire okay
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh 30 years ago I also forgot to tell
 
04:27:05.910 --> 04:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
you I was chairman of the co board for
 
04:27:09.790 --> 04:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
eight years okay and I saw the
 
04:27:11.870 --> 04:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
shenanigans that were being played then
 
04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
to keep competition out that's all it
 
04:27:17.630 --> 04:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
was it protected franchises I would see
 
04:27:20.429 --> 04:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
CEOs of hospitals lie through their
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:27.429 --> 04:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
okay free market does have a think about
 
04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
it is what makes America great okay we
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
need a bit more of it in healthcare but
 
04:27:35.550 --> 04:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time we do need to take care
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
of those who can least afford the care
 
04:27:41.670 --> 04:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
or and to protect them and there's a way
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
all right and we need some checks and
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
balances in place but with all that
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
being said it is complicated
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
unequivocally all right
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
Weber so would you agree based on what
 
04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
you just said that it might be a really
 
04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
good idea to start with a s a study
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
committee to study the data on this
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely before we with a very broad
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
brush yes suddenly change the entire
 
04:28:16.510 --> 04:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
scheme yes study committee with the
 
04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
intent to truly study this and not delay
 
04:28:22.349 --> 04:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
and postpone it absolutely absolutely
 
04:28:23.830 --> 04:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
because it is a complicated issue but
 
04:28:26.830 --> 04:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
there are solutions and transparency is
 
04:28:27.910 --> 04:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
04:28:31.229 --> 04:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
solution okay it's insane that there
 
04:28:34.990 --> 04:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
isn't any or very little of it it really
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
is and the people that are in government
 
04:28:40.510 --> 04:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
programs end up costing the government
 
04:28:42.750 --> 04:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
more because they end up into the
 
04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
because they have no skin in the game
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
and they end up going into the emergency
 
04:28:50.309 --> 04:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
Care representative lontine thank you Mr
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
um but with regard to the three payments
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
for service um and the hospitals paid a
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
lot more um isn't that to try to
 
04:29:07.630 --> 04:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
compensate for all of the unpaid
 
04:29:10.269 --> 04:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
services that a hospital provides that
 
04:29:12.830 --> 04:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
an Outpatient Surgical Center is not
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to provide great
 
04:29:17.950 --> 04:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
question many hospitals don't don't pay
 
04:29:20.910 --> 04:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
taxes they don't pay property taxes they
 
04:29:23.710 --> 04:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
don't pay income taxes so that's one
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
subsidy they get paid more like
 
04:29:32.229 --> 04:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
5x okay and we have the Dish payment in
 
04:29:32.239 --> 04:29:32.990 align:start position:0%
5x okay and we have the Dish payment in
New

04:29:32.990 --> 04:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the The Meta scam
 
04:29:39.109 --> 04:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
program okay where for uncompensated
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
care checks are written out to Hospital
 
04:29:43.030 --> 04:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
Systems not to private practicing
 
04:29:45.429 --> 04:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
providers who give who and I'm one of
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
them we treat a lot of Medicaid patients
 
04:29:52.510 --> 04:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
and we get no subsidy at all and we get
 
04:29:54.670 --> 04:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
paid far less and to my knowledge and
 
04:29:58.030 --> 04:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
actually we're meeting with HHS soon we
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
haven't been given an increase in
 
04:30:02.070 --> 04:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement in
 
04:30:04.590 --> 04:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
decades okay this is private
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
practice so we need to help priv private
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
practitioners Thrive not just be able to
 
04:30:12.870 --> 04:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
get by the other there was a statistic
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
by the
 
04:30:17.070 --> 04:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
way um that I don't that's very
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
important the overhead of doing
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
third-party billing by the way is about
 
04:30:25.469 --> 04:30:25.479 align:start position:0%
30% now for a private practice 30% of
 
04:30:27.710 --> 04:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
your overhead is
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
pre-authorizations and getting chasing
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
your money it's
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
ridiculous other question representative
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
Nel thank you Mr chair and thanks again
 
04:30:38.990 --> 04:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and thanks again
 
04:30:41.149 --> 04:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
for saying what I've been saying that
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
was an awesome comment you just said but
 
04:30:45.429 --> 04:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
anyways with that said this is just for
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
clarification because I I I don't know
 
04:30:49.750 --> 04:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
that we should be holding Bedford
 
04:30:51.870 --> 04:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
ambulatory Surgical Center outl the
 
04:30:53.469 --> 04:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
model that what's being proposed here
 
04:30:55.710 --> 04:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
but it's a good model but I'm just
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
curious um does CMC have any ownership
 
04:31:01.229 --> 04:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
interest in Basque or is it yes 42%
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get out it because it's
 
04:31:04.349 --> 04:31:04.359 align:start position:0%
no longer no we're no longer partners
 
04:31:07.950 --> 04:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
with CMC okay so it's now owned by HCA
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
and um we just want to be independent
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
for now let the dust settle and
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
but I do believe we need a strategic
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
partner long term um and I'm also the
 
04:31:19.510 --> 04:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
CEO of the orchard Surgical Center in
 
04:31:21.710 --> 04:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
Salem I'm the CEO of the National
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
invatory Surgical Center in NASA and um
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
and so they're all uh they offer a far
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
better physician experience as well as a
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
patient experience and a far lower price
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
point can I ask a followup followup what
 
04:31:38.640 --> 04:31:39.910 align:start position:0%
point can I ask a followup followup what
is

04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
strateg okay representative w inquiry of
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
the chair sure
 
04:31:48.590 --> 04:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh I just we see we seem to have had a
 
04:31:50.910 --> 04:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
very far ranging and an interesting
 
04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
discussion about health care policy
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
generally but time is creeping on and
 
04:31:59.109 --> 04:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that perhaps the chair might
 
04:32:01.469 --> 04:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
direct all of us because I'm one of the
 
04:32:05.070 --> 04:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
worst offenders to turn our attention
 
04:32:06.990 --> 04:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking to this bill because
 
04:32:08.830 --> 04:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
we're already over time for the next
 
04:32:08.840 --> 04:32:12.990 align:start position:0%
we're already over time for the next
bill

04:32:12.990 --> 04:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:14.469 --> 04:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:32:17.429 --> 04:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
Nagel okay all right representative
 
04:32:21.149 --> 04:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:24.030 --> 04:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
yet thank you Mr chair and I'll try to
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
be brief with this
 
04:32:30.910 --> 04:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
ly um so and referring to this bill
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
would do you believe that this would
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
encourage more centers as you have or
 
04:32:39.990 --> 04:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
would this would do you think this would
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
increase more avail I'm not so sure I
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
think centers like I like I'm involved
 
04:32:48.510 --> 04:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
in and as well as I'm not the only
 
04:32:51.469 --> 04:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur there there are many um
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
they would go to where there's a
 
04:32:56.349 --> 04:32:56.359 align:start position:0%
possible need in that Marketplace okay
 
04:32:58.109 --> 04:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
um and it's a laot of
 
04:33:02.910 --> 04:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
Economics um again the this is more
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
elective care not urgent not emergency
 
04:33:08.910 --> 04:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
care or nursing home care uh but there
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
are there are elective services um you
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
know it could be an urgent care center
 
04:33:17.709 --> 04:33:17.719 align:start position:0%
uh for an example uh or walk-in Center
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
um that may want to go into a
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
Marketplace that um that may be far more
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
affordable for the patients uh in that
 
04:33:30.029 --> 04:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
community so um it's it's that could
 
04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
possibly happen I I know there was an
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
incident in Littleton uh and it actually
 
04:33:36.750 --> 04:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
ended up going before the co and got
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
worked out but an urgent care center
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
ended up going to Littleton uh from what
 
04:33:42.910 --> 04:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
I understand Littleton Hospital is still
 
04:33:44.830 --> 04:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
there and so is the Urgent Care Center
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
and um and maybe the hospital ended up
 
04:33:49.510 --> 04:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
buying the Urgent Care Center I don't
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
know but when you don't have people that
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
are in a position of strength no
 
04:33:58.109 --> 04:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
dialogue takes place no partnership gets
 
04:34:03.869 --> 04:34:03.879 align:start position:0%
worked out um so um but it can open up
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
the market
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you just one quick followup
 
04:34:11.310 --> 04:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
quick followup would you believe that I
 
04:34:13.349 --> 04:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
did use use your facility I had to drive
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
with my back completely out I have only
 
04:34:18.551 --> 04:34:18.561 align:start position:0%
paid a fraction of what I had found it
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
would cost me elsewhere to have an MRI
 
04:34:24.910 --> 04:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
on my back and I was able to uh deliver
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
a disc with that information to the
 
04:34:29.949 --> 04:34:29.959 align:start position:0%
hospital the day that I went and it was
 
04:34:29.959 --> 04:34:31.150 align:start position:0%
hospital the day that I went and it was
like

04:34:31.150 --> 04:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:34:35.551 --> 04:34:35.561 align:start position:0%

department and a legislative liazon um
 
04:35:25.590 --> 04:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
the department is not taking a position
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 548 but we'd like to offer
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
testimony ma'am one second could you

ASM boy o y
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
s the department does not know what the
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
bill means when it states membership
 
04:35:43.789 --> 04:35:43.799 align:start position:0%
based business model the department
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
needs clarification on what those terms
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
mean additionally the department does
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
not make licensing decisions based on
 
04:35:53.070 --> 04:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
funding licensing decisions are made to
 
04:35:55.830 --> 04:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
protect the health safety and well-being
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
of the residents of New Hampshire the
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
department would not exempt a facility
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
from lure based on funding the purpose
 
04:36:05.109 --> 04:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
of Licensing is to ensure that
 
04:36:07.869 --> 04:36:07.879 align:start position:0%
facilities provide safe and appropriate
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
Care thank you for your time and
 
04:36:11.789 --> 04:36:11.799 align:start position:0%
consideration we're happy to answer any
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank you any
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:36:21.070 --> 04:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you uh Mr chair and thank
 
04:36:25.029 --> 04:36:25.039 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I think we
 
04:36:28.269 --> 04:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
heard something about Oklahoma so that
 
04:36:32.429 --> 04:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
other states already have uh system uh
 
04:36:36.590 --> 04:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
suggested uh in this bill so how their
 
04:36:43.150 --> 04:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.990 --> 04:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
could you please clarify your question I
 
04:36:48.670 --> 04:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah you say the the department
 
04:36:53.070 --> 04:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
won't be able to accommodate uh uh this
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
system but we heard that other states
 
04:36:58.590 --> 04:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
already uh using it um thank you
 
04:36:59.789 --> 04:36:59.799 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate the
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
clarification I don't think we testified
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
that we would not be able to do this I
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
think our testimony is is that as
 
04:37:08.269 --> 04:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
written we would need clarity as and
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
that we as a state in New Hampshire we
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
don't license based on funding we
 
04:37:15.551 --> 04:37:15.561 align:start position:0%
license based on health and safety we
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.230 --> 04:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
also I'm sorry I lost my train of
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
thought it's oh we would not exempt any
 
04:37:32.830 --> 04:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
type of facility from licensing based on
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
a type of
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
funding other questions representative
 
04:37:37.799 --> 04:37:41.949 align:start position:0%
funding other questions representative
Weber

04:37:41.949 --> 04:37:41.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
so I haven't actually parsed the
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
language here in light of what you said
 
04:37:49.590 --> 04:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
which was A New Concept to me but if in
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
fact what this bill does is say there
 
04:37:56.750 --> 04:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
are no licensing requirements for these
 
04:38:00.310 --> 04:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
facilities anymore and therefore you
 
04:38:03.470 --> 04:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
have no jurisdiction over them does that
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
mean that these facilities have no
 
04:38:11.709 --> 04:38:11.719 align:start position:0%
regulation in terms of safety patient
 
04:38:14.269 --> 04:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
care and that kind of issue thank you
 
04:38:17.551 --> 04:38:17.561 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I believe so we
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
would again need more clarification if
 
04:38:23.310 --> 04:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
the entire purpose of the bill is based
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
on funding and how a a patient a client
 
04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
a resident is going to pay for the
 
04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
services we would not exempt such
 
04:38:35.949 --> 04:38:35.959 align:start position:0%
facility because it's a funding
 
04:38:39.949 --> 04:38:39.959 align:start position:0%
mechanism followup but my followup is
 
04:38:43.949 --> 04:38:43.959 align:start position:0%
that as I read the bill and I have to
 
04:38:45.629 --> 04:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
say I didn't read it quite as closely as
 
04:38:47.709 --> 04:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
I ought to have because I've seen it
 
04:38:51.070 --> 04:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
before uh but my understanding is that
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
it exempts facilities from licensing
 
04:38:57.869 --> 04:38:57.879 align:start position:0%
requirements specifically so although
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
all other similar facilities have
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements these would not
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
because the statute says those statutes
 
04:39:09.029 --> 04:39:09.039 align:start position:0%
don't apply to them and they a specific
 
04:39:11.150 --> 04:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
exemption is that correct thank you the
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
way it is written now and is the way
 
04:39:16.750 --> 04:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
that we understand it as well so if in
 
04:39:21.629 --> 04:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
fact you were to pass this bill as
 
04:39:24.189 --> 04:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
written it appears that there would be a
 
04:39:27.150 --> 04:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
segment of facilities that are providing
 
04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
similar services to similar New
 
04:39:31.150 --> 04:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents that would not be
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
regulated by our Bureau thank
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Lucas and then
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
representative palazov um in general
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals are required to be accredited
 
04:39:45.070 --> 04:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
and they undergo inspections on a
 
04:39:45.080 --> 04:39:46.230 align:start position:0%
and they undergo inspections on a
regular

04:39:46.230 --> 04:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
regular
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
basis um what happens in this situation
 
04:39:50.670 --> 04:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
with these
 
04:39:52.750 --> 04:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
facilities so in the state of New
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA 151 deems all hospitals
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
licensed and other facilities in the
 
04:40:00.948 --> 04:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that accept that
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
are CMS certified are what we call
 
04:40:06.628 --> 04:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
deemed licensing which means we issue a
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
license and they are responsible for
 
04:40:12.550 --> 04:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
following RSA 150 1 and in and the
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
hospital rules should our CM we are also
 
04:40:17.910 --> 04:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
I also oversee the CMS certification
 
04:40:21.990 --> 04:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
state agency so if a hospital has been
 
04:40:25.150 --> 04:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
determined to violate the law or the
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
rule then the department would have
 
04:40:30.240 --> 04:40:31.868 align:start position:0%
rule then the department would have
interaction

04:40:31.868 --> 04:40:31.878 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
04:40:36.190 --> 04:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
however because federal regulations and
 
04:40:38.750 --> 04:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
accrediting regulations are generally
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
more stringent than New Hampshire state
 
04:40:43.030 --> 04:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
law and Rule that's probably not
 
04:40:45.868 --> 04:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
something we would see
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
commonly um in a situation where a
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
facility did not take um accept Medicare
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
or Medicaid only private insurance or or
 
04:40:58.628 --> 04:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
cash um what would be the body that
 
04:41:04.110 --> 04:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
would uh be responsible for
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
certification that's a really great
 
04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
question I believe I I can't think of
 
04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
any Hospital in the New Hampshire
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
hospital Association is here um I think
 
04:41:16.670 --> 04:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
still um they might be better able to
 
04:41:20.190 --> 04:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
answer that question um I know that in I
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
I I'm unaware of any Hospital in the
 
04:41:23.590 --> 04:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire currently that is
 
04:41:27.030 --> 04:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
not CMS certified um there are nursing
 
04:41:29.470 --> 04:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
homes that are not CMS certified and
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
those fall under the purview of our
 
04:41:33.190 --> 04:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
health facilities Administration adult
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
licensing so the state does have
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority Under RSA 151 and
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire administrative rules
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
which I I think would be the same
 
04:41:44.628 --> 04:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
situation if a hospital were to conduct
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
business in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:41:48.270 --> 04:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
and not be accredited or
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
certified representative
 
04:41:53.628 --> 04:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
pazo thank you Mr chair so follow up on
 
04:41:56.708 --> 04:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
previous so department does not license
 
04:42:00.350 --> 04:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
based on funding but my impression is
 
04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
this bill ask asks uh to license based
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
on funding so my question is like uh is
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
it something uh does it conflict with
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
other RSA or does it is it based on some
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
your internal rules that you do not
 
04:42:21.390 --> 04:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
license based on funding uh like I'm
 
04:42:23.310 --> 04:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand if there are
 
04:42:26.670 --> 04:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
some Amendment needed in different uh uh
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
chapter of the
 
04:42:31.948 --> 04:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
law oh I'm sorry I thought um
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
representative McAn had a comment um we
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
would be absolutely willing to work with
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative McLean and any other of
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
the sponsors to determine what language
 
04:42:46.030 --> 04:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
might help the bill um and what and then
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
we would be better able to comment on
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
whether we were in support or opposition
 
04:42:52.910 --> 04:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
based on any amended
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
language anyone else representative
 
04:42:58.670 --> 04:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
Woods uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:43:01.910 --> 04:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um we're
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
looking at this as an exception to being
 
04:43:06.430 --> 04:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
licensed can you think of anything
 
04:43:09.948 --> 04:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
similar that is similarly not licensed
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
or is this the only exception that you
 
04:43:14.110 --> 04:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
would be aware
 
04:43:16.270 --> 04:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
of so thank you for the question
 
04:43:18.430 --> 04:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
representative Woods there are a number
 
04:43:20.708 --> 04:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
of exemptions that already exist in RSA
 
04:43:23.550 --> 04:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
151 I do you have the rule in front of
 
04:43:26.190 --> 04:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
you uh the law I'm happy to read those
 
04:43:28.910 --> 04:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
off to you if you would like but I um
 
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
there are um primary care practices like
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
if you're a doctor that has your own um
 
04:43:35.760 --> 04:43:36.590 align:start position:0%
if you're a doctor that has your own um
your

04:43:36.590 --> 04:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:43:40.270 --> 04:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
own oh my God practice sorry um you are
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
exempt from license
 
04:43:45.590 --> 04:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
so because your regulatory oversight
 
04:43:47.788 --> 04:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
comes directly from the office of
 
04:43:51.070 --> 04:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
professional lure and so that would be
 
04:43:52.948 --> 04:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
the only thing I can think of off the
 
04:43:55.110 --> 04:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
top of my head I can I'll be happy to
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
look at the exemptions and see if
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's anything
 
04:44:01.310 --> 04:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
else I guess my my question was directed
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
to facilities I understand the the
 
04:44:06.550 --> 04:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
individual practitioners they're still U
 
04:44:09.948 --> 04:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
subject to licensing uh within the state
 
04:44:12.430 --> 04:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
by virtue of requirement of being
 
04:44:14.670 --> 04:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
whatever uh but I'm talking about you
 
04:44:17.230 --> 04:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
know entities like these entities that
 
04:44:20.310 --> 04:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
we're describing here in this bill so
 
04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
this so reading out of RSA 151 this
 
04:44:24.868 --> 04:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
chapter shall not be construed to
 
04:44:26.910 --> 04:44:26.920 align:start position:0%

profession facilities operating as

and any other facilities Exempted by
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
rules adopted under this chapter might
 
04:44:51.390 --> 04:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
be the only ones that apply out of the
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
entire list that could you what's the
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
RSA again RSA
 
04:44:59.470 --> 04:44:59.480 align:start position:0%

04:45:30.030 --> 04:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:32.590 --> 04:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
counties thank you Mr chair um for the
 
04:45:34.350 --> 04:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
record my name is David Ross and I am
 
04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
the administrator of Hillsboro County
 
04:45:38.830 --> 04:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
nursing home and I am testifying on
 
04:45:40.788 --> 04:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire Association
 
04:45:43.628 --> 04:45:43.638 align:start position:0%
of counties um we want to register our
 
04:45:46.670 --> 04:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill um as it
 
04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
relieves a couple of things um one is
 
04:45:50.510 --> 04:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
that it relieves the moratorium on
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
nursing home beds the moratorium on
 
04:45:55.270 --> 04:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
nursing home beds was implemented to
 
04:45:57.150 --> 04:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
help um control costs in the state of
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and specifically to help
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
Focus development of Care on
 
04:46:05.948 --> 04:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
community-based um uh services this bill
 
04:46:08.510 --> 04:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
um proposes to increase Community Based
 
04:46:10.390 --> 04:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
Serv institutional Services rather than
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
Community Based services and that's
 
04:46:14.788 --> 04:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
contrary to the goals of the moratorium
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
on nursing home care it's not a
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
transparency bill as proposed as was
 
04:46:21.390 --> 04:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
shared at the opening of this hearing
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
today and I was concerned about duding
 
04:46:26.590 --> 04:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
the conversation in discussions about
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hospital Services specifically the bill
 
04:46:32.110 --> 04:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
addresses nursing home care specifically
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
and the moratorium on beds and that's a
 
04:46:37.150 --> 04:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
very grave concern for US Representative
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
Weber um shared at the beginning of
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
today's hearing that there's concerns
 
04:46:43.548 --> 04:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
about the impact to payer mix to all
 
04:46:46.350 --> 04:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and that is definitely our
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
concern facilities that accept Medicaid
 
04:46:50.510 --> 04:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
understand that Medicaid does not cover
 
04:46:52.510 --> 04:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
the true cost of all care and it's
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
necessary for operations for us to have
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
a mix of payers providing a a service
 
04:47:00.990 --> 04:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
provider that is only providing um
 
04:47:03.190 --> 04:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
services in an unlicensed environment to
 
04:47:06.430 --> 04:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
private pay individuals will clearly
 
04:47:08.548 --> 04:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
deflect and divert individuals from
 
04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
nursing homes that require a mix of
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
payers um as um representative lontine
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
pointed out um the concern about what
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
will happen with folks when they exhaust
 
04:47:21.670 --> 04:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
their resources is a grave concern for
 
04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
us as well um we see that this was going
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
to put greater pressure on County
 
04:47:28.990 --> 04:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
nursing homes specifically as folks that
 
04:47:30.830 --> 04:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
are only going to have no more resources
 
04:47:32.548 --> 04:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
that they'll have to be come to the
 
04:47:34.948 --> 04:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
facilities of Last Resort which are us
 
04:47:36.628 --> 04:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
which will Pro provide a greater burden
 
04:47:38.910 --> 04:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
on County taxpayers for
 
04:47:41.310 --> 04:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
sure discharges are certainly concerned
 
04:47:42.628 --> 04:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
and we're concerned about you know the
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
availability of services but growing
 
04:47:47.070 --> 04:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
community- based care services is a
 
04:47:49.230 --> 04:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
substantial component of the system of
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
care bill that was passed on by prior
 
04:47:54.750 --> 04:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
legislative act our objective as a state
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
should be to develop community-based
 
04:47:58.948 --> 04:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
services and and pour all of our
 
04:48:02.110 --> 04:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
resources into that this bill also
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
directs the department to create a study
 
04:48:08.548 --> 04:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
to determine um feasibility of self-pay
 
04:48:10.990 --> 04:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
services or membership Based Services
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest that that actually
 
04:48:14.350 --> 04:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
deflects the focus of where the
 
04:48:15.628 --> 04:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
department should be spending its
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
limited resources on focusing on
 
04:48:20.190 --> 04:48:20.200 align:start position:0%
long-term services and supports
 
04:48:21.868 --> 04:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
long-term services and supports should
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
be really focused on developing
 
04:48:26.070 --> 04:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
community- Based Services our frail
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
elderly population is growing at an
 
04:48:31.470 --> 04:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
exponential rate the moratorium on beds
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
will help control the growth of costs in
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
institutional care so we have to really
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
focus on communitybased services this
 
04:48:40.750 --> 04:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
bill proposes growth in in
 
04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
institutionalized Services which is
 
04:48:45.270 --> 04:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
contrary to any movement that we have to
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
make as a state to be able to provide
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
care for our frail elderly population
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
that is growing I share the Department's
 
04:48:54.708 --> 04:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
concerns that this bill does lack um
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
clear definition of the term membership
 
04:48:59.708 --> 04:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
organizations St wrapping up please
 
04:49:00.990 --> 04:49:01.000 align:start position:0%

five minutes I'd really appreciate three
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
instead that's fine Mr chairman uh for
 
04:49:46.990 --> 04:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
the record Brendan Williams I'm the

04:49:50.670 --> 04:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Association uh we represent
 
04:49:52.350 --> 04:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities including
 
04:49:54.190 --> 04:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
nursing homes capable of serving over
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
5,000 Granite sters um we've heard a lot
 
04:50:00.350 --> 04:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
of uh interesting testimony today a lot
 
04:50:02.788 --> 04:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
of it's focused on Primary Care uh for
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
some reason but uh this bill uh what we
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
choose to focus on is the exemption that
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
it would make for nursing homes uh from
 
04:50:13.230 --> 04:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
the bedm orium I heard reference to the
 
04:50:15.150 --> 04:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
state of Oklahoma uh the state of
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma still has a certificate of need
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
requirement for nursing homes uh
 
04:50:21.788 --> 04:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
Governor D santis in Florida when he
 
04:50:23.948 --> 04:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
Exempted hospitals uh from the
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
certificate of need law there that was
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
longstanding did not exempt uh nursing
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
homes uh nursing homes are are something
 
04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
different and that's been recognized by
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
um other states with certificate of need
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
laws uh because it really isn't a free
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
market uh given the preponderance of
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh as a payment Source uh for
 
04:50:48.310 --> 04:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
nursing home residents uh any disruption
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh to uh the nursing home Market would
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
not be uh un Ain to sort of the child's
 
04:50:56.750 --> 04:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
game of Jenga where you pull loose a log
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
and the whole thing comes toppling down
 
04:51:00.990 --> 04:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh that really is what would uh happen
 
04:51:04.830 --> 04:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
here um there's also ambiguity uh with
 
04:51:07.910 --> 04:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
respect to the bill uh it uh speaks to a
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
membership based business model but that
 
04:51:12.030 --> 04:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude third party payment you
 
04:51:14.350 --> 04:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
could still get Medicaid payment under
 
04:51:17.350 --> 04:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
that because it says or exclusively
 
04:51:19.150 --> 04:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
provide services to those who are making
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
direct payments so in other words if you
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
were a member somehow of one of these
 
04:51:24.990 --> 04:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
nursing homes uh you could be admitted
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
as a Medicaid resident which would drive
 
04:51:29.948 --> 04:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
up a County property tax cost and uh
 
04:51:33.070 --> 04:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
there's also a um sort of as been
 
04:51:34.948 --> 04:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned before sort of a a patient
 
04:51:37.470 --> 04:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights light uh in this bill I'm
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
not quite sure why a lot of things were
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
omitted from the existing Patient Bill
 
04:51:43.150 --> 04:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
of Rights as it applies to nursing homes
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
not simply admission or discharge based
 
04:51:49.110 --> 04:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
on your ability to pay uh but even a
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
host of visitation rights and other
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
rights of uh human dignity uh that
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
residents of nursing homes in the state
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire have come to expect uh
 
04:52:00.990 --> 04:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
I just think that this uh this bill is
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time uh we have a
 
04:52:05.230 --> 04:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns I've shared them in a
 
04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
letter Bob Dunn uh with the dasis of
 
04:52:10.830 --> 04:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester would have been here he had a
 
04:52:12.628 --> 04:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
death and his family was not able to be
 
04:52:14.590 --> 04:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
here but his testimony has also been
 
04:52:16.910 --> 04:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
distributed and Catholic Charities of
 
04:52:19.110 --> 04:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is my largest nonprofit
 
04:52:21.548 --> 04:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
member uh with that Mr chairman uh I
 
04:52:23.150 --> 04:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
would certainly take any questions and I
 
04:52:25.390 --> 04:52:25.400 align:start position:0%

04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
sir no one else has signed up to testify
 
04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to before I close
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing seeing no one else I'm going
 
04:52:44.070 --> 04:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on HB 548 FN
 
04:52:47.430 --> 04:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on HB 223
 
04:52:49.548 --> 04:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
and recognize the prime sponsor who is
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%

mlan you wise representative you stayed
 
04:53:00.150 --> 04:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
in the back you didn't have to travel
 
04:53:10.548 --> 04:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:12.670 --> 04:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair McDonald members of the
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Mark
 
04:53:16.830 --> 04:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
McLean representing Hillsboro district
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
15 which is uh Manchester Ward 8 I want
 
04:53:22.110 --> 04:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
to thank everybody for the vigorous
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
discussion on hbf 548 and I already have
 
04:53:28.030 --> 04:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
some notes in for an amendment on that
 
04:53:30.150 --> 04:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce HB
 
04:53:32.510 --> 04:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
223 uh the rural Health Care
 
04:53:36.030 --> 04:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
accessibility act which amends RSA 151
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
colon 4 to allow for Health Care
 
04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
Facilities that are not hospitals so
 
04:53:44.670 --> 04:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
ambulatory centers birthing centers Etc
 
04:53:47.708 --> 04:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
within the 15m radius of critical access
 
04:53:49.628 --> 04:53:49.638 align:start position:0%
hospitals without giving notification to
 
04:53:52.990 --> 04:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
the hospital so the purpose of this bill
 
04:53:55.590 --> 04:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
is to allow for the expansion of Health
 
04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
Care access over time in the rural
 
04:54:00.270 --> 04:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
regions of the state by allowing healthc
 
04:54:01.708 --> 04:54:01.718 align:start position:0%
care facilities you know such as
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
convenient MD and others to open in the
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
rural areas when a business case can be
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
made for the opening uh building outside
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
the 15 M radius of a critical access
 
04:54:16.590 --> 04:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh might seem like a easy thing
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
to do and be you know a low barrier um
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
but uh 84% of New Hampshire's land mass
 
04:54:26.750 --> 04:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
is classified as Rural and when you
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
overlay the exclusion zones of each
 
04:54:31.070 --> 04:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
critical access Hospital on top of the
 
04:54:33.510 --> 04:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
other it essentially leaves only the
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
Southeastern portion of the State open
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
to unrestricted Health Care development
 
04:54:40.590 --> 04:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
so the federal government as I mentioned
 
04:54:42.788 --> 04:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
in the prior testimony uh created the
 
04:54:46.030 --> 04:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
critical access Hospital designation in
 
04:54:49.628 --> 04:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
1997 and we adopted our current lure in
 
04:54:52.948 --> 04:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
2016 the intention was to preserve
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
Hospital access in rural areas but the
 
04:54:57.470 --> 04:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
result has been that New Hampshire
 
04:55:00.788 --> 04:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
hasn't built a new hospital in over 40
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
years in spite of the fact that the
 
04:55:05.910 --> 04:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
population has grown by 450,000 people
 
04:55:09.270 --> 04:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
over that same period of time um I've
 
04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
had legislative research search trying
 
04:55:12.990 --> 04:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
to get me T Trend data on axis but as I
 
04:55:15.150 --> 04:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned before it's really hard data
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
to get your hands on nevertheless I did
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
provide each of you uh with a handout
 
04:55:21.548 --> 04:55:21.558 align:start position:0%
highlighting just some of the
 
04:55:24.670 --> 04:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
disparities between rural and non rural
 
04:55:27.868 --> 04:55:27.878 align:start position:0%
care and the anecdotal data about
 
04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
declining uh rural access is absolutely
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelming we hear it on testimonies
 
04:55:35.070 --> 04:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh in many other bills before this
 
04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
committee and you can hear it on the
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
news every day on the ride home from
 
04:55:41.310 --> 04:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
work so
 
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
um the federal critical access law and
 
04:55:47.430 --> 04:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
our own facility licensure rules I think
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
that they've done nothing to expand or
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
even preserve rural access instead what
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
I believe they've done is they've only
 
04:55:57.868 --> 04:55:57.878 align:start position:0%
insulated our rural hospitals as they'
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
fallen through a period of very long
 
04:56:03.628 --> 04:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
decline while shutting out any outside
 
04:56:07.070 --> 04:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
attempts at reform or innovation so this
 
04:56:09.788 --> 04:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean uh the hospitals and other
 
04:56:11.910 --> 04:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
facilities haven't made attempts at
 
04:56:14.948 --> 04:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
internal reform I know they have but I
 
04:56:18.350 --> 04:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
think that when they look to reform just
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
like any organization that looks to
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
reform they're going to look to uh
 
04:56:25.628 --> 04:56:25.638 align:start position:0%
reform within themselves first as
 
04:56:28.270 --> 04:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to looking at the system as a
 
04:56:30.030 --> 04:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
whole and I think that's what we need to
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
do we have to look at what we need to do
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
to expand our access and not just look
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
at the hospitals in isolation so I think
 
04:56:41.310 --> 04:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
that's why this bill is important I
 
04:56:43.548 --> 04:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's a business case
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
for Mass openings of clinics and other
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
facilities in the rural areas of the
 
04:56:49.548 --> 04:56:49.558 align:start position:0%
state so I again I don't think you're
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
going to see a Title Wave of facility
 
04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
opens if this becomes law however um as
 
04:56:57.310 --> 04:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
time moves on what kind of other
 
04:57:01.030 --> 04:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
Innovations might occur by pulling down
 
04:57:04.070 --> 04:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
the 15 Mile exclusion barrier today we
 
04:57:05.830 --> 04:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
may be opening ourselves up to New
 
04:57:08.750 --> 04:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
Opportunities tomorrow so I made sure
 
04:57:10.750 --> 04:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
when I drafted the bill
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
that I would not allow for the building
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
of another hospital within the 15m
 
04:57:19.470 --> 04:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
radius okay so I'm allowing clinics to
 
04:57:21.628 --> 04:57:21.638 align:start position:0%
open up birthing centers to open up
 
04:57:24.190 --> 04:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
within the 15-mile exclusion Zone but
 
04:57:26.230 --> 04:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
I'm preserving
 
04:57:29.548 --> 04:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
explicitly um the the the prohibition on
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
other hospitals and I did this out of
 
04:57:34.270 --> 04:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
concern that allowing the presence of
 
04:57:36.990 --> 04:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
another uh Hospital would jeopardize the
 
04:57:39.270 --> 04:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
critical access status um of our
 
04:57:41.230 --> 04:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals and the
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
favorable reimbursement rates that that
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
status provides so I think as a result
 
04:57:49.070 --> 04:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
the bill tries to to chart a middle path
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
to slowly provide greater access to the
 
04:57:53.590 --> 04:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
rural parts of the state while still pre
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
preserving the critical access status of
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
our hospitals and hopefully discover new
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
ways to provide service and I hope you
 
04:58:03.430 --> 04:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
will support it thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:58:07.470 --> 04:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:58:12.350 --> 04:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just trying
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
to work backwards in my mind about where
 
04:58:18.868 --> 04:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
facilities are in our state and I think
 
04:58:20.708 --> 04:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
you made a statement about how much of
 
04:58:23.670 --> 04:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
the state was excluded by the 15 Mile
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
exclusion was that your point because I
 
04:58:28.110 --> 04:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
can think of an awful lot of places in
 
04:58:30.990 --> 04:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
the state that don't that aren't 15
 
04:58:33.548 --> 04:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
miles away from a critical access
 
04:58:37.590 --> 04:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
Hospital well if you and put
 
04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I had Mike represent mlan
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
but mic thank you very much guys sorry
 
04:58:45.868 --> 04:58:45.878 align:start position:0%
um so there was a gentleman who had done
 
04:58:49.070 --> 04:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
a study last year um not for this bill
 
04:58:50.190 --> 04:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
because this is the first time I've
 
04:58:52.350 --> 04:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill and what he did in
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
that study and I wasn't able to get
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
access to it and he's off at a different
 
04:58:59.230 --> 04:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
conference so he couldn't testify today
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
but that showed when you overlaid all
 
04:59:06.350 --> 04:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
these 15 Mile discs um it pretty much
 
04:59:06.360 --> 04:59:07.948 align:start position:0%
these 15 Mile discs um it pretty much
covered

04:59:07.948 --> 04:59:07.958 align:start position:0%
covered
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
744 square miles
 
04:59:14.070 --> 04:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
of real estate which basically just left
 
04:59:18.350 --> 04:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
the extreme uh Southeastern part of the
 
04:59:21.948 --> 04:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
the state not in an exclusion Zone with
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
respect to the the the 15 Mile exclusion
 
04:59:27.948 --> 04:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
rate so um so that's kind of the the
 
04:59:29.430 --> 04:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
state that we're in the sou eastern part
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
of the state is open to development but
 
04:59:32.470 --> 04:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of stuff when you over link
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
everything it's it's kind of blocked
 
04:59:35.708 --> 04:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean you can't you know
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
apply but you have to go through an
 
04:59:39.628 --> 04:59:39.638 align:start position:0%
onerous process this is just trying to
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
break that
 
04:59:44.230 --> 04:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
down other
 
04:59:47.430 --> 04:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Woods uh thank
 
04:59:49.150 --> 04:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
you Rich chair thanks for taking the
 
04:59:52.750 --> 04:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
question um um in physics we always look
 
04:59:56.750 --> 04:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
at how things apply at the infinity and
 
05:00:00.190 --> 05:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
zero and that gives us some insight in
 
05:00:03.030 --> 05:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
this particular situation Let's uh Edge
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
toward Infinity uh we have a hospital
 
05:00:10.270 --> 05:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
and there's a 15 mile radius uh and we
 
05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
have uh an ambulatory surgical unit come
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
in and then next year we have a
 
05:00:21.470 --> 05:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
laboratory come in and then the next
 
05:00:24.390 --> 05:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
year we have a birthing center come
 
05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
in uh and then we next year we have a
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
convenient medicine come
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
in um could you surmise what would
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:41.230 --> 05:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
hospital um
 
05:00:44.670 --> 05:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
if if that was to happen then that would
 
05:00:47.708 --> 05:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
put I think enormous pressure yes it
 
05:00:51.470 --> 05:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
would um but I I I honestly think for
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
example if you're looking at
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
Lancaster I I just don't think that
 
05:00:57.868 --> 05:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to be able to make a
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
business case that I'm going to be
 
05:01:00.990 --> 05:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
opening up a convenient MD and an
 
05:01:04.990 --> 05:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
ambulatory Center um and uh a birthing
 
05:01:07.510 --> 05:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
center and a dialis center all in that
 
05:01:11.788 --> 05:01:11.798 align:start position:0%
area if you look at um for example we
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
have the gentleman here talking about
 
05:01:16.030 --> 05:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
Basque Imaging I think Basque is the
 
05:01:18.470 --> 05:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
only other ambulatory Center that really
 
05:01:20.270 --> 05:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
has has opened up in in the greater
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester area there you've got a
 
05:01:25.548 --> 05:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
massive amount of population um and I I
 
05:01:28.110 --> 05:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
just and and not only do you have a
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
massive population but you're not in an
 
05:01:33.910 --> 05:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
exclusion zone so you could totally
 
05:01:36.310 --> 05:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
flood it but even in in the most densely
 
05:01:38.350 --> 05:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
populated area of the state you're not
 
05:01:41.070 --> 05:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
seeing the scenario that that you rais
 
05:01:44.070 --> 05:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
out so I think that if you were to you
 
05:01:48.270 --> 05:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
know pull back that that um that
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
requirement in in in the extreme
 
05:01:52.430 --> 05:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
Northern areas of the state I just I
 
05:01:54.510 --> 05:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
mean if it's not happening in in
 
05:01:56.670 --> 05:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester why would it be happening up
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
in Lancaster or Littleton so I I just
 
05:02:00.788 --> 05:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
don't think that you can make a business
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
case for a massive penetration of this I
 
05:02:05.430 --> 05:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
so I I think the fear I mean there
 
05:02:08.190 --> 05:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
there's always uncertainty but I I I I'm
 
05:02:09.548 --> 05:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be too worried about that in
 
05:02:09.558 --> 05:02:10.750 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be too worried about that in
my

05:02:10.750 --> 05:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:02:13.628 --> 05:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
opinion other questions representative
 
05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
Lucas yes um in a situation where there
 
05:02:21.030 --> 05:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
is only one Critical Care Hospital in a
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
large geographic area and there would be
 
05:02:27.868 --> 05:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
the development of an Ambulatory Surgery
 
05:02:30.590 --> 05:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
Center and maybe a birthing center if
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
there are untour events at these centers
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
an unusual reaction to Anesthesia or
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
complication that's
 
05:02:39.430 --> 05:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
unanticipated and the patient needs to
 
05:02:41.470 --> 05:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
be transferred to the critical care
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
hospital how does this bill account for
 
05:02:48.030 --> 05:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
the need for those Services by these
 
05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
putative ambulatory centers that might
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
open thank you I mean I I I I think that
 
05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
could be addressed you know in in the
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
same way that um the situation at Basque
 
05:03:02.548 --> 05:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
might be addressed I mean if they if
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
they have that situation right there the
 
05:03:07.788 --> 05:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
there are hospitals in the area just
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
like there would be your you're going to
 
05:03:12.150 --> 05:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
have obviously by definition of this
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill a critical access hospital within a
 
05:03:19.150 --> 05:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
15 a 15 mile range because outside of
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
that obviously you're you're Exempted so
 
05:03:23.470 --> 05:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a hospital close by
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
that would address that
 
05:03:28.628 --> 05:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
need other questions did that answer
 
05:03:28.638 --> 05:03:31.390 align:start position:0%
need other questions did that answer
your

05:03:31.390 --> 05:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:35.070 --> 05:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
question followup followup thank you um
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
well in the absence of the hospital
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
services being available should these
 
05:03:45.868 --> 05:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
other facilities begin to take
 
05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
away patients and
 
05:03:52.590 --> 05:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
income how then will those facilities
 
05:03:55.948 --> 05:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
address these emergencies that might
 
05:04:00.430 --> 05:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
arise thank you I and I
 
05:04:05.110 --> 05:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
think I I think that um as I said I I
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
don't see that you're going to have a
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
large penetration of these Services
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
because you're not seeing it in the more
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
densely populated areas of the state so
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to have a modest
 
05:04:17.230 --> 05:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
penetration but it is going to I think
 
05:04:20.030 --> 05:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
slowly expand service I think quite
 
05:04:24.910 --> 05:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
honestly there are much greater stresses
 
05:04:27.788 --> 05:04:27.798 align:start position:0%
on critical access hospitals than the
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
fact that a birthing center might open
 
05:04:31.868 --> 05:04:31.878 align:start position:0%
next door I I think you know you're
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
talking about you know our reimbursement
 
05:04:35.948 --> 05:04:35.958 align:start position:0%
rates and and you know the heavily
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
Reliance on on on Medicaid up in in the
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh in in the rural areas of the state I
 
05:04:45.150 --> 05:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
think in my opinion those are pressures
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
that are going to carry a lot more
 
05:04:50.350 --> 05:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
weight then I I happen to open you know
 
05:04:52.548 --> 05:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
a dialysis center next to Alice or
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
something like that um that that would
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
be I I would think that would there are
 
05:04:58.110 --> 05:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
much greater pressures at play on on
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
those critical access hospitals right
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm still working on
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
the the whole point of this
 
05:05:13.150 --> 05:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
Bill you're saying that the bill will
 
05:05:16.990 --> 05:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
bring more services to underserved rural
 
05:05:20.948 --> 05:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
areas but for example where I live which
 
05:05:23.548 --> 05:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
is an underserviced rural area in the
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
western part of the state Kean New
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire isn't within 15 miles of a
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
critical access hospital and I don't see
 
05:05:31.480 --> 05:05:33.708 align:start position:0%
critical access hospital and I don't see
anybody

05:05:33.708 --> 05:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
05:05:36.110 --> 05:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
clamoring to open up a lot of these
 
05:05:37.868 --> 05:05:37.878 align:start position:0%
things there we do have a different
 
05:05:41.548 --> 05:05:41.558 align:start position:0%
hospital there I'm just not seeing what
 
05:05:46.590 --> 05:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
the need for this bill is frankly well I
 
05:05:49.070 --> 05:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
mean in in a way representative Weber I
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
I think you're kind of making my point
 
05:05:54.190 --> 05:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
because if you're in an area that is
 
05:05:58.350 --> 05:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
outside of that exclusion disc and which
 
05:06:00.990 --> 05:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
is like I said they all overlap and if
 
05:06:02.390 --> 05:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
you happen to be in an area where there
 
05:06:04.030 --> 05:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
is no overlap and so there is an
 
05:06:06.510 --> 05:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put something there uh
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is it hasn't gone
 
05:06:12.110 --> 05:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
there and and I think the reason if
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's true that it hasn't gone there is
 
05:06:16.190 --> 05:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
because there's there's just not a
 
05:06:19.150 --> 05:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
business case to do that and that's why
 
05:06:22.470 --> 05:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
I'm saying this bill is not going to
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
happen and all of a sudden you're going
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
to see this Mass penetration all that
 
05:06:30.190 --> 05:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to do is it's going
 
05:06:33.390 --> 05:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
to say that as things change and the
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
demographics evolve um that there is an
 
05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity if a facility can make a
 
05:06:42.070 --> 05:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
business case hey you know what the
 
05:06:44.548 --> 05:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
demographics have changed there's a real
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
need for a dialysis center here um we
 
05:06:50.670 --> 05:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
think there's an opportunity and so
 
05:06:52.670 --> 05:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to go forward with it I I
 
05:06:55.390 --> 05:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
think what it does is it's preemptive in
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
that it anticipates opportunity in the
 
05:07:00.350 --> 05:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
future but the fact like you said I
 
05:07:03.190 --> 05:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
don't live within an exclusion Zone and
 
05:07:04.990 --> 05:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
there's still nothing here I think
 
05:07:07.948 --> 05:07:07.958 align:start position:0%
underscores the point that the evolution
 
05:07:10.590 --> 05:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be slow it's not going to be
 
05:07:12.788 --> 05:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
massive and so it it looks to the Future
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't a more sensible approach be
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
the one that we had outlined for us with
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
the Bedford Surgical Center where they
 
05:07:27.868 --> 05:07:27.878 align:start position:0%
partnered with a
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
hospital because it was mutually
 
05:07:33.628 --> 05:07:33.638 align:start position:0%
beneficial and shouldn't we be leaving
 
05:07:35.350 --> 05:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
this in place and
 
05:07:38.110 --> 05:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
encouraging those kinds of mutually
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
beneficial partners ships rather than
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
freestanding competitions where
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
everybody's building their little
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
fif I well I think if I and I don't want
 
05:07:53.350 --> 05:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
to speak um I think Mr veis is going to
 
05:07:54.830 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
be coming up and speaking on this fill
 
05:07:56.788 --> 05:07:56.798 align:start position:0%
again so he could maybe speak to that
 
05:07:59.548 --> 05:07:59.558 align:start position:0%
but my understanding from his testimony
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
was that you know he partnered with CMC
 
05:08:05.310 --> 05:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh right now that is kind of null and
 
05:08:08.708 --> 05:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
void because of the merger with CMC but
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
he himself said uh and I don't want to
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
speak for him but you know that in in
 
05:08:16.990 --> 05:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
the future he's going to be looking to
 
05:08:19.788 --> 05:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
kind of reestablish that and I think
 
05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
that reestablishment in the case that
 
05:08:24.910 --> 05:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
he's saying is is is one of benefit to
 
05:08:28.190 --> 05:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
both parties so I think if there's a
 
05:08:30.750 --> 05:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
natural inertia towards that that's not
 
05:08:33.670 --> 05:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
going to require any special
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
legislation um but there may be
 
05:08:38.670 --> 05:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
situations where you know what um it's
 
05:08:40.948 --> 05:08:40.958 align:start position:0%
beneficial or it's not beneficial and
 
05:08:42.590 --> 05:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
there may be certain cases and I don't
 
05:08:45.750 --> 05:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
want to micromanage where they say maybe
 
05:08:49.948 --> 05:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
it's better that we kind of go alone um
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
and this would allow for that um and I
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
don't know uh with a convenient MD for
 
05:08:58.030 --> 05:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
example if they necessarily always
 
05:09:00.390 --> 05:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
partner uh with with the hospital and
 
05:09:01.628 --> 05:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
there may be a case that say you know we
 
05:09:03.230 --> 05:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't we don't want to do that so I
 
05:09:04.910 --> 05:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
think what this does is just gives the
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility but where it is beneficial
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they'll seek it out
 
05:09:11.390 --> 05:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
any final
 
05:09:20.590 --> 05:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.390 --> 05:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
mlan also signed up to speak is former
 
05:09:40.548 --> 05:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:44.430 --> 05:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
Mark as Mark said round two um so for
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
the record again my name is Jerry kerk
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
and um I have a little bit of sort of
 
05:09:50.548 --> 05:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
inside knowledge in this whole process
 
05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
because I served on the sb97 study
 
05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
committee that developed the language
 
05:09:57.628 --> 05:09:57.638 align:start position:0%
that is oursa 154 sorry 1514 critical
 
05:09:59.230 --> 05:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
access access hospitals provide
 
05:10:00.868 --> 05:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
essential access to healthcare and rural
 
05:10:02.708 --> 05:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
areas for the residents who would
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise need to travel very long
 
05:10:06.150 --> 05:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
distances for their care this is
 
05:10:07.708 --> 05:10:07.718 align:start position:0%
particularly important for emergency
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
services and maternity services they run
 
05:10:12.110 --> 05:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
on razor thin margins they lose money on
 
05:10:15.390 --> 05:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
services such as their 24-hour per day
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
full service emergency room and
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
obstetrical services which serve a lot
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
of people who are Medicaid and Medicare
 
05:10:23.350 --> 05:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
or with no insurance those services are
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
critical to have available and they are
 
05:10:27.510 --> 05:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the higher paying services
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the higher paying insurances just a
 
05:10:31.708 --> 05:10:31.718 align:start position:0%
couple quick things to cover stuff CAU
 
05:10:32.868 --> 05:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
earlier the reason they don't go about
 
05:10:34.708 --> 05:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
25 beds is if they do they're no longer
 
05:10:36.430 --> 05:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
a critical access hospital that's how
 
05:10:38.670 --> 05:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's defined second we talked about the
 
05:10:41.670 --> 05:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
15 m discs overlaying them 744 square
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
miles the area of New Hampshire is 9,300
 
05:10:46.470 --> 05:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
square miles there's a lot of room I
 
05:10:48.190 --> 05:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
live in a place where I'm more than 15
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
miles from two critical access hospitals
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
in any case um urgent care facilities
 
05:10:56.590 --> 05:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
such as convenient MD they provide
 
05:10:58.270 --> 05:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
evaluation of coughs and colds broken
 
05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
bones illnesses all kinds of good things
 
05:11:02.548 --> 05:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
like that but they do not handle major
 
05:11:04.590 --> 05:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
trauma and they're usually open only
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. look at their
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
website as a result they require far
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
fewer resources for Staffing and
 
05:11:13.070 --> 05:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
Equipment than a critical access
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital which must be ready for a motor
 
05:11:16.990 --> 05:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle accident a gunshot wound or a
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
case of appendicitis at 2: in the
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
morning with the staff and operating
 
05:11:22.470 --> 05:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
room to handle it and regarding uh
 
05:11:24.310 --> 05:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas's comment birthing
 
05:11:26.350 --> 05:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
centers they don't do cesarian sections
 
05:11:27.628 --> 05:11:27.638 align:start position:0%
you're in a birthing center everything's
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
going great suddenly the Kids in
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
Distress they go to the hospital they
 
05:11:33.670 --> 05:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
need to have a cesarian section well
 
05:11:35.390 --> 05:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
guess what the hospital has a lot of
 
05:11:38.190 --> 05:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
cost keeping 24-hour a day Obstetricians
 
05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
ready to do
 
05:11:41.548 --> 05:11:41.558 align:start position:0%
that C-section that doesn't mean
 
05:11:42.750 --> 05:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
birthing centers aren't good they're
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
great but they do have an impact um and
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen that with a closure of a
 
05:11:48.830 --> 05:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
number of our maternity centers in
 
05:11:51.548 --> 05:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
various hospitals in our rural areas U
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
so the point is that the establishment
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
of a nearby facility providing only the
 
05:11:57.510 --> 05:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
relatively simple basic services from 8
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
to 8 8: a.m. to p.m. but not providing
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
high-intensity costly 24-hour a day
 
05:12:06.270 --> 05:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
trauma care or complicated abstr care
 
05:12:07.868 --> 05:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
will skim off patients with good
 
05:12:09.628 --> 05:12:09.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from the critical access
 
05:12:12.190 --> 05:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
Hospital that'll change the payer mix of
 
05:12:14.670 --> 05:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
the critical access hospital and
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
possibly lead to its closure or
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
diminished Services outside facilities
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
cherry-picking the well-paying
 
05:12:23.070 --> 05:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
uncomplicated patients would have a
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
significant negative economic effect on
 
05:12:27.628 --> 05:12:27.638 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals the losses
 
05:12:29.270 --> 05:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
sustained by those providers would lead
 
05:12:31.190 --> 05:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
to Cuts in Services as we've seen with
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
those closure or maternity centers as I
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
said this has a long history and I
 
05:12:39.310 --> 05:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
served on the committee in uh for s sp97
 
05:12:40.948 --> 05:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
with Senator Bradley the master of
 
05:12:42.910 --> 05:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
compromise this was in
 
05:12:45.750 --> 05:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
2019 we had multiple meetings and heard
 
05:12:47.708 --> 05:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
from all stakeholders including
 
05:12:49.310 --> 05:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Urgent Care Centers such
 
05:12:51.910 --> 05:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
as convenient MD compromised wording was
 
05:12:54.030 --> 05:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
developed with all the stakeholders
 
05:12:57.030 --> 05:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
involved including convenient MD and
 
05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
that resulted in RSA 1514a in 2020 and
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
the gist of this is just simply says you
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
got to let that hospital know if they
 
05:13:07.270 --> 05:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
object there's going to be an expert uh
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
study and if that expert study shows
 
05:13:11.708 --> 05:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
that there's a critical material in
 
05:13:13.350 --> 05:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
adverse impact on the healthcare
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
facility then it would not the new
 
05:13:18.030 --> 05:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
facility would not be licensed so the
 
05:13:19.390 --> 05:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
point of the matter is that's really
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
kind of weird this bill well just I have
 
05:13:24.150 --> 05:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
two sentences this bill seeks to remove
 
05:13:26.430 --> 05:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
from this process all of the special
 
05:13:28.510 --> 05:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
Health Services except if you want to to
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
a hospital it doesn't make any sense to
 
05:13:35.110 --> 05:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
Simply discard the com the compromise
 
05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
established by Senator Bradley the sp97
 
05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
study committee and the stakeholders
 
05:13:42.548 --> 05:13:42.558 align:start position:0%
without a good reason thank you thank
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative Woods
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
05:13:52.110 --> 05:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this issue of the
 
05:13:55.150 --> 05:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
15 miles and well little why don't they
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
develop it outside uh sometimes uh
 
05:13:59.948 --> 05:13:59.958 align:start position:0%
drilling down and you may have seen this
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
on your committee uh but malpractice
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
insurance uh Physicians facilities have
 
05:14:09.150 --> 05:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
to have malpractice uh some kind of
 
05:14:12.270 --> 05:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
insurance companies I can Envision say a
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
convenient MD wanting to do 16 miles uh
 
05:14:18.030 --> 05:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
but their malpractice insurance says you
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
have to be within 15 miles to get is did
 
05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
you run across that particular you know
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
yeah that it's something that's always
 
05:14:28.310 --> 05:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
in the back of the mind of of
 
05:14:30.430 --> 05:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners but yeah that particular
 
05:14:33.788 --> 05:14:33.798 align:start position:0%
uh issue did not come up I I think um
 
05:14:35.628 --> 05:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question but I mean
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
in general again if you have a um a
 
05:14:42.070 --> 05:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
complicated birth uh you know hopefully
 
05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
15 miles you can get there reasonably
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
quickly but nevertheless it is a bit of
 
05:14:45.920 --> 05:14:46.628 align:start position:0%
quickly but nevertheless it is a bit of
a

05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
concern representative sa thank you for
 
05:14:53.150 --> 05:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just I'm not
 
05:14:55.350 --> 05:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get too to the weeds with this
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
but what would be is there a defined
 
05:15:00.270 --> 05:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
process to what that would go into
 
05:15:03.230 --> 05:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
determining the need and where that need
 
05:15:06.548 --> 05:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
is and like would it be have to be
 
05:15:08.510 --> 05:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
really picky choosy say we have a really
 
05:15:11.070 --> 05:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
big need for like say a maternity or
 
05:15:14.590 --> 05:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
this or that in this area but is if it
 
05:15:16.670 --> 05:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason wasn't cost
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
effective for you yet there need is
 
05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
still there how is this would this still
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
be able to meet the needs that New
 
05:15:25.470 --> 05:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs by passing
 
05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
this um I'm not sure I can answer that
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
question but the bottom line is this
 
05:15:31.948 --> 05:15:31.958 align:start position:0%
isn't this particular
 
05:15:37.230 --> 05:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
um 152 uh 151 D4 I mean um didn't so
 
05:15:39.750 --> 05:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
much talk about needs it it ask he talks
 
05:15:41.310 --> 05:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
about as we say protecting critical
 
05:15:43.270 --> 05:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
access hospitals and they do need to be
 
05:15:45.030 --> 05:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
protected because they need to be there
 
05:15:47.150 --> 05:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
for the the other basic high level
 
05:15:50.948 --> 05:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
services that are needed um so what
 
05:15:53.948 --> 05:15:53.958 align:start position:0%
happens is I mean for example let's say
 
05:15:55.788 --> 05:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
uh where I live which is a little over
 
05:15:58.110 --> 05:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
15 miles from both Memorial Hospital and
 
05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
Huggins Hospital a birthing center could
 
05:16:01.628 --> 05:16:01.638 align:start position:0%
be a really good idea but it really
 
05:16:03.110 --> 05:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
would be great if we're paired with one
 
05:16:04.470 --> 05:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
of those hospitals so that they could be
 
05:16:06.510 --> 05:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
working together and there's an easy
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
communication and so on and so forth um
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
so that you can if the need is there you
 
05:16:15.070 --> 05:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
can still build it's just simply that if
 
05:16:17.310 --> 05:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
you we'd have to notify that hospital
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
and if they say hey not a problem we
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
can't keep up with this particular issue
 
05:16:23.430 --> 05:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
there no problem if they say this is
 
05:16:25.590 --> 05:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
going to really undermine the our our
 
05:16:28.150 --> 05:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
mission of providing care for our
 
05:16:30.270 --> 05:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
community uh but again this is not
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
something they don't just say it and it
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
happens it there's an expert review to
 
05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
look to really see does it have an
 
05:16:40.030 --> 05:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
impact is that impact material an an
 
05:16:42.910 --> 05:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
materially adverse impact if it's not
 
05:16:44.868 --> 05:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
you go ahead but if it really is a bad
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
problem then you be say no you're not
 
05:16:48.350 --> 05:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
going to license that person of course
 
05:16:50.310 --> 05:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
again they might just jump out 16 miles
 
05:16:52.270 --> 05:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
as representative wood said
 
05:16:52.280 --> 05:16:54.150 align:start position:0%
as representative wood said
representative

05:16:54.150 --> 05:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:58.230 --> 05:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you uh Mr chair so if our
 
05:17:01.270 --> 05:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
goal is uh protecting critical access
 
05:17:03.990 --> 05:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals right now we are protecting
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
them through this this restrictions so
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
can we monetize it can we put a number
 
05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh if they're losing certain amount of
 
05:17:15.990 --> 05:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
good paying patients can we just
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
subsidize them to to save them in this
 
05:17:22.590 --> 05:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
situation and do you have any ballpark
 
05:17:25.510 --> 05:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
estimation like what kind of uh
 
05:17:27.708 --> 05:17:27.718 align:start position:0%
subsidies that would need to survive I
 
05:17:28.990 --> 05:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
don't have all those details right here
 
05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
but that's indeed what why if you're
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
defined as a critical access hospital
 
05:17:36.110 --> 05:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
that does give you some subsidies that's
 
05:17:37.270 --> 05:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of their whole
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
program is so that they can actually
 
05:17:41.070 --> 05:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
exist and that's again why you would not
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
go to 26 because suddenly you then are
 
05:17:45.510 --> 05:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know back to what any other hospital
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
is um sure I mean that if we if there's
 
05:17:50.990 --> 05:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
the appetite here to throw a bunch of
 
05:17:52.708 --> 05:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
extra money at the hospitals and keep
 
05:17:55.470 --> 05:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
them afloat wonderful idea but I don't
 
05:17:57.670 --> 05:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
think there is we did see an enormous
 
05:17:59.708 --> 05:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
change when expanded medicaid opened up
 
05:18:01.150 --> 05:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
because a lot of hospitals they were in
 
05:18:03.190 --> 05:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
the red because they had so much
 
05:18:05.708 --> 05:18:05.718 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care now they were
 
05:18:08.070 --> 05:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
actually able to get only maybe 70 cents
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
on the dollar that's better than zero
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
cents on the dollar and expanded
 
05:18:15.190 --> 05:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid sorry helped save a
 
05:18:16.910 --> 05:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
lot of our critical access hospitals or
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
any of the hospitals but critical access
 
05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
are running on margins that are
 
05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
generally about a percent yeah
 
05:18:22.920 --> 05:18:24.310 align:start position:0%
generally about a percent yeah
representative

05:18:24.310 --> 05:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
Lucas thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
05:18:29.110 --> 05:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question so help me a little
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
bit I'm trying to find a way to
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand the position
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
of the ambulatory Center in that they
 
05:18:44.708 --> 05:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
are wanting to operate at a profit of
 
05:18:47.670 --> 05:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
course um and they are
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
generating also a small but significant
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
number of patients who are going to
 
05:18:52.798 --> 05:18:55.070 align:start position:0%
number of patients who are going to
require

05:18:55.070 --> 05:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:18:58.990 --> 05:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
hospitalization but in taking the profit
 
05:19:01.110 --> 05:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
potentially from the same hospital that
 
05:19:04.030 --> 05:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
they're depending on to accept the cases
 
05:19:06.590 --> 05:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
that don't go well right in the
 
05:19:09.150 --> 05:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery Center or the birth
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
Center how do
 
05:19:15.270 --> 05:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
we mesh this all together well that's
 
05:19:17.948 --> 05:19:17.958 align:start position:0%
where you get into what was just said by
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
represent poos off a couple moments ago
 
05:19:21.510 --> 05:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
I mean if you if you said okay this is a
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
problem we'd like to have this thing but
 
05:19:24.390 --> 05:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
we'll also subsidize the hospital so
 
05:19:26.430 --> 05:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
they can have staff on on hand to be
 
05:19:27.990 --> 05:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
able to handle that cesarian section at
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
two in the morning that's peachy but do
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
we really think we want to do that is is
 
05:19:34.270 --> 05:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
there an appetite for a bunch of uh
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to do that I doubt it so
 
05:19:39.628 --> 05:19:39.638 align:start position:0%
the issue is if you don't want to just
 
05:19:42.868 --> 05:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
suck off all of the good paying patients
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
and leave everything else and all the
 
05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
well it's actually not just the good
 
05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
paying patience it's really The
 
05:19:50.070 --> 05:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
increased overhead of a hospital that
 
05:19:51.910 --> 05:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
has to be available 24 hours a day for
 
05:19:54.628 --> 05:19:54.638 align:start position:0%
trauma care for maternity care and you
 
05:19:56.390 --> 05:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
know you have to have then a bunch of
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians who can be taking call
 
05:20:00.548 --> 05:20:00.558 align:start position:0%
that's a big difference than somebody
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
who's working you know 8:00 a.m. to 8:00
 
05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
pm I think you know that thank you any
 
05:20:08.030 --> 05:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
any one final question representative of
 
05:20:08.040 --> 05:20:09.910 align:start position:0%
any one final question representative of
Theus

05:20:09.910 --> 05:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
Theus
 
05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so my question is
 
05:20:16.190 --> 05:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
what do you do with PE with a with a
 
05:20:21.948 --> 05:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
patient like me that had a very severe
 
05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
problem with my back I had been told I
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
needed to get an MRI and I needed it
 
05:20:31.948 --> 05:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
like toot sweet so
 
05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
I I called around to different
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
facilities in my neck of the woods to
 
05:20:39.150 --> 05:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
see how much it would cost cost and it
 
05:20:41.470 --> 05:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
was like cost
 
05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
prohibitive and then I ended up calling
 
05:20:46.868 --> 05:20:46.878 align:start position:0%
bask and it wasn't cost prohibitive at
 
05:20:50.270 --> 05:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
all so I jumped in my car and in massive
 
05:20:54.150 --> 05:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
pain drove to that facility and and got
 
05:20:55.110 --> 05:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
what I
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
needed if if his facility had been
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
closer it would have been nice but I
 
05:21:02.670 --> 05:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
mean I don't I don't know what how how
 
05:21:05.110 --> 05:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
do you handle someone who like me who is
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
not going to to go to a place where
 
05:21:11.390 --> 05:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
I can't even afford to to do what needs
 
05:21:12.390 --> 05:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
done well a couple things one is um I'm
 
05:21:17.030 --> 05:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
not quite sure were you within the
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
catchment zone of a critical access
 
05:21:20.910 --> 05:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
hospital and this other uh Imaging
 
05:21:22.830 --> 05:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
Center was within that same catchment
 
05:21:24.590 --> 05:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
Zone if we're talking about long ways
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
away it's irrelevant to what this bill
 
05:21:29.708 --> 05:21:29.718 align:start position:0%
has to talk about um but the in essence
 
05:21:32.070 --> 05:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
though it is a very mixed up messed up
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
system because the insurers and it's
 
05:21:35.470 --> 05:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
often even considered proprietary
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
information as to what they will
 
05:21:40.510 --> 05:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
reimburse for any given study and that's
 
05:21:42.788 --> 05:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
what makes it such a mess to try to find
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
out the cost as we already covered in
 
05:21:48.750 --> 05:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
detail this morning so yeah we ready to
 
05:21:51.670 --> 05:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
move on I think I think we are um thanks
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
for telling me go early so I can go to
 
05:21:54.190 --> 05:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
my next I know you have another hering
 
05:21:57.708 --> 05:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
to go to next hearing thank you thank
 
05:22:00.910 --> 05:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Nick veis
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
from the Bedford ambulatory Surgical
 
05:22:02.718 --> 05:22:14.470 align:start position:0%
from the Bedford ambulatory Surgical
Center

05:22:14.470 --> 05:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Nick valis I'm the
 
05:22:18.190 --> 05:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
CEO of the Bedford ambulatory Surgical
 
05:22:21.830 --> 05:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
Center uh former board chair of the co
 
05:22:27.070 --> 05:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
board for a number of years and um I I'm
 
05:22:29.230 --> 05:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
here to testify in support of this bill
 
05:22:33.948 --> 05:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the Halo if you may
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I I have I had a prim large primary
 
05:22:40.030 --> 05:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
care practice in
 
05:22:42.548 --> 05:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
coldbrook and it was amazing how many
 
05:22:46.030 --> 05:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
times people would just drive 3 hours 2
 
05:22:48.910 --> 05:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
and 1 half hours to find lower cost
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
care the the
 
05:22:54.510 --> 05:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
interesting observation here is that the
 
05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
people who can probably at least afford
 
05:22:58.670 --> 05:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
health care are paying the highest costs
 
05:23:01.310 --> 05:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
in health care in the North
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
Country think about
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
that access affordability should be our
 
05:23:07.680 --> 05:23:09.750 align:start position:0%
that access affordability should be our
aim

05:23:09.750 --> 05:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
aim
 
05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
and the leading obstacle to access the
 
05:23:16.270 --> 05:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
care is the price of care leading cause
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
of me of bankruptcy is medically
 
05:23:22.150 --> 05:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
related people are in high deductibles
 
05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
five and $6,000 individual deductible
 
05:23:28.910 --> 05:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
101,000 family deductible is the norm
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
self-insured I think it's altruistic to
 
05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
say you know we need to protect these
 
05:23:36.798 --> 05:23:38.548 align:start position:0%
say you know we need to protect these
rural

05:23:38.548 --> 05:23:38.558 align:start position:0%
rural
 
05:23:41.628 --> 05:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals by creating
 
05:23:44.670 --> 05:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
all this all these policies and Noble
 
05:23:46.590 --> 05:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
intention but the people you're really
 
05:23:50.708 --> 05:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
hurting are the people who need elective
 
05:23:55.510 --> 05:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
care okay so I'll give a great
 
05:23:59.430 --> 05:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
example Alex Alice pek Hospital in
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
Lebanon right critical access Hospital
 
05:24:04.708 --> 05:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
guess what hospital it
 
05:24:09.270 --> 05:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
very expensive care the people in the
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River Valley are paying very
 
05:24:18.628 --> 05:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
high prices in health care because
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock is protected by the
 
05:24:24.310 --> 05:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
fact that it oversees Alis pect
 
05:24:26.948 --> 05:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
Hospital there are many Physicians who
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
would love to send their patients to
 
05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
lower cost centers in the Connecticut
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
River Valley but it's not possible and
 
05:24:36.110 --> 05:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
the interesting part is the co process
 
05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
and uh is Alive and Well in ver Vermont
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont has one ambulatory Surgical
 
05:24:41.400 --> 05:24:43.230 align:start position:0%
Vermont has one ambulatory Surgical
Center

05:24:43.230 --> 05:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
Center
 
05:24:47.150 --> 05:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
one it's a hospital dominated Health
 
05:24:47.160 --> 05:24:47.868 align:start position:0%
one it's a hospital dominated Health
Care

05:24:47.868 --> 05:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
Care
 
05:24:51.788 --> 05:24:51.798 align:start position:0%
System expensive as hell for
 
05:24:51.798 --> 05:24:55.510 align:start position:0%
System expensive as hell for
employers

05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:58.548 --> 05:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
so the laws of Economics would govern a
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
lot of this people aren't going to open
 
05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
up an ASC I'll give you an anecdotal
 
05:25:06.150 --> 05:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
funny story years ago the athletic
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
trainer for the Montreal Canadian
 
05:25:12.270 --> 05:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
called me and because because of
 
05:25:15.150 --> 05:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
socialized medicine in Canada they
 
05:25:17.670 --> 05:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't get their hockey players in
 
05:25:19.868 --> 05:25:19.878 align:start position:0%
time in C you know in enough time
 
05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
because time matters in sports right
 
05:25:24.270 --> 05:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
seasons are only so long and he said hey
 
05:25:28.150 --> 05:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
Nick let's open up a surgical center in
 
05:25:30.628 --> 05:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
coldbrook and you know we met on their
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
way down to Boston the plate of Bruins
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
and uh I said this is impossible I said
 
05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
you can't just make a living on Montreal
 
05:25:41.948 --> 05:25:41.958 align:start position:0%
Canadians there none of population but
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
the interesting part about all that is
 
05:25:45.390 --> 05:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
volume is important it is important to
 
05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
those critical access hospitals as
 
05:25:51.190 --> 05:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
well but healthc care is changing you're
 
05:25:53.548 --> 05:25:53.558 align:start position:0%
seeing more people you're seeing people
 
05:25:56.350 --> 05:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
more meta out right and catastrophic
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
problems I don't believe you want to
 
05:26:00.030 --> 05:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
have surgeries in some of these rural
 
05:26:01.350 --> 05:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
Health hospitals because the volume
 
05:26:03.510 --> 05:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
isn't there to support the
 
05:26:06.788 --> 05:26:06.798 align:start position:0%
Excellence so I believe econ laws of
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
Economics won't create a
 
05:26:11.590 --> 05:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
catastrophe okay and the fact of the
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
matter is these this issue of critical
 
05:26:15.510 --> 05:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
access Hospital protection is also
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
protecting some high cost centers so
 
05:26:21.310 --> 05:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
05:26:24.430 --> 05:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes representative
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
lontine um thank you um and thanks for
 
05:26:29.910 --> 05:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question again you mentioned
 
05:26:33.230 --> 05:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
that the uh practice in holber was
 
05:26:36.948 --> 05:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
Primary Care yes ma'am um and I don't I
 
05:26:38.430 --> 05:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
don't know who passed out this I I think
 
05:26:39.948 --> 05:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
it was representative
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
mlan um but when I look through that it
 
05:26:47.430 --> 05:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
mainly is pointing to the lack of
 
05:26:51.310 --> 05:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
primary care in the in the in rural
 
05:26:54.910 --> 05:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
areas the lack of of rural Physicians
 
05:26:54.920 --> 05:26:56.910 align:start position:0%
areas the lack of of rural Physicians
Pas

05:26:56.910 --> 05:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
Pas
 
05:26:59.310 --> 05:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
um percentage of population without
 
05:27:03.310 --> 05:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
primary care but this bill does nothing
 
05:27:07.750 --> 05:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
to be as far as the exemptions that are
 
05:27:10.430 --> 05:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
removed moving it it doesn't seem like
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals um they're
 
05:27:16.350 --> 05:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
protecting against any other Primary
 
05:27:18.548 --> 05:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
Care in fact that's the problem so
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
changing this bill does nothing to
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
change the situation with primary care
 
05:27:26.430 --> 05:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
it's only for specialist I would agree
 
05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
with that wholeheartedly I mean we there
 
05:27:29.868 --> 05:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
is a shortage of primary care and I
 
05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
still own Primary Care some CRI Primary
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
Care practices but this The Spill
 
05:27:37.350 --> 05:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't address that issue it's the
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
issue of costs for an example an
 
05:27:42.708 --> 05:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
MRI all right if you were in the
 
05:27:44.670 --> 05:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
coldbrook market you'd literally have to
 
05:27:48.030 --> 05:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
drive as far south as Manchester Bedford
 
05:27:50.070 --> 05:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
to get a reasonable price now if you're
 
05:27:53.150 --> 05:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
in a $5,000 $6,000 deductible and you're
 
05:27:57.030 --> 05:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
paying $3,500 or $4,000 for an MRI and
 
05:27:59.150 --> 05:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
you can get it for $600
 
05:28:01.788 --> 05:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
$700 you'll get in a car and drive
 
05:28:04.548 --> 05:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many of the patients don't
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
understand what the prices are but
 
05:28:12.190 --> 05:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
but just to follow up but just to
 
05:28:14.548 --> 05:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
clarify this bill won't change anything
 
05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
as far as Primary Care Act that is
 
05:28:18.788 --> 05:28:18.798 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
05:28:21.628 --> 05:28:21.638 align:start position:0%
sabert um well I also agree like a lot
 
05:28:23.150 --> 05:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be done I'm having a hard time
 
05:28:24.628 --> 05:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
getting past and somebody brought it up
 
05:28:26.750 --> 05:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
about the liability that's often
 
05:28:29.430 --> 05:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
attributes to higher costs at healthc
 
05:28:32.670 --> 05:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
care facilities um in the first place
 
05:28:34.190 --> 05:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
and we were kind of discussing that
 
05:28:36.990 --> 05:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
about the iffy side of that in regards
 
05:28:40.030 --> 05:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
to the distance and then also you know
 
05:28:41.990 --> 05:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
what we were previously talking about
 
05:28:43.548 --> 05:28:43.558 align:start position:0%
that it seems to me there would be
 
05:28:45.430 --> 05:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
issues with liability as well I'm not
 
05:28:47.430 --> 05:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
sure how you're able to
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
charge I mean do you have a example of
 
05:28:53.110 --> 05:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
that if if you say it's so much cheaper
 
05:28:55.390 --> 05:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
are you being covered by the same type
 
05:28:57.750 --> 05:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
of liability insurance that can protect
 
05:28:59.868 --> 05:28:59.878 align:start position:0%
a consumer if there happens to be a case
 
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
of malpractice sure uh yeah um yes all
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
the I I don't believe there I to my
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge there facilities operating
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
without medical malpractice insurance so
 
05:29:13.948 --> 05:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
I think from a medical malpractice
 
05:29:16.270 --> 05:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
standpoint liability is not an issue
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
here it's access to more affordable care
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
and if you can't afford it you don't
 
05:29:25.390 --> 05:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
have access period uh they they it you
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
may have an MRI in at uh upper
 
05:29:30.750 --> 05:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Valley Hospital that day but
 
05:29:33.310 --> 05:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
if you can't afford the $5,000 or four
 
05:29:35.788 --> 05:29:35.798 align:start position:0%
you know it's $3500 what you don't get
 
05:29:39.470 --> 05:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
an MRI period
 
05:29:41.430 --> 05:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
any final
 
05:29:46.990 --> 05:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.750 --> 05:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
you and also signed up to speak and
 
05:29:51.750 --> 05:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually the last speaker is a br Ben
 
05:30:01.708 --> 05:30:01.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:04.470 --> 05:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
Association thanks Mr chairman getting a
 
05:30:06.788 --> 05:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
little long in the tooth here my name is
 
05:30:08.590 --> 05:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
Ben Bradley I am the the vice president
 
05:30:09.910 --> 05:30:09.920 align:start position:0%

05:30:11.628 --> 05:30:11.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Hospital Association we
 
05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
represent all 13 critical access
 
05:30:16.190 --> 05:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the hospital Association is
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to HB 223 this issue dates back
 
05:30:24.470 --> 05:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
to 2019 when a legislative committee as
 
05:30:26.310 --> 05:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
indicated by representative kerk was
 
05:30:28.150 --> 05:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
established a study providing certain
 
05:30:29.788 --> 05:30:29.798 align:start position:0%
healthc care services while ensuring
 
05:30:32.708 --> 05:30:32.718 align:start position:0%
increased access to Affordable Health
 
05:30:35.310 --> 05:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
Services in rural areas of the state of
 
05:30:36.830 --> 05:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
note the committee recognized that
 
05:30:38.510 --> 05:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
critical access Hospital
 
05:30:40.708 --> 05:30:40.718 align:start position:0%
tend to have low patient volume paired
 
05:30:43.510 --> 05:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
with high fixed costs these facilities
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
also have a payer mix that is heavily
 
05:30:47.070 --> 05:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
dependent on public payers like Medicare
 
05:30:49.270 --> 05:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid with a smaller share of
 
05:30:51.750 --> 05:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
privately insured patients rural
 
05:30:53.708 --> 05:30:53.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals have fewer admissions
 
05:30:55.190 --> 05:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
compounded by declining rural
 
05:30:57.590 --> 05:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
populations in many rural communities
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
that can make it challenging for
 
05:31:00.750 --> 05:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals to remain
 
05:31:03.230 --> 05:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
financially viable threatening total
 
05:31:06.548 --> 05:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
closure and access deserts for essential
 
05:31:09.708 --> 05:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
Services otherwise only available over
 
05:31:13.190 --> 05:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
an hour and then some away the
 
05:31:15.150 --> 05:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan study committee recommended
 
05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislation negotiated by the interested
 
05:31:22.510 --> 05:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
parties which is what became law RSA 151
 
05:31:26.270 --> 05:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
4-a in 2020 this included engagement
 
05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
with Convenient Care interested parties
 
05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
at the table we oppose this bill because
 
05:31:33.628 --> 05:31:33.638 align:start position:0%
it breaks face faith in the negotiated
 
05:31:36.150 --> 05:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
statute from 2020 which we maintain is
 
05:31:38.030 --> 05:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
an important and reasonable expectation
 
05:31:39.990 --> 05:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
for new entrance seeking to provide
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
services within a 15m radius of a
 
05:31:44.510 --> 05:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
critical access hospital let me be clear
 
05:31:46.030 --> 05:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
about the process this is not
 
05:31:49.110 --> 05:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
certificate of need current statute
 
05:31:51.310 --> 05:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
requires any person or entity proposing
 
05:31:53.070 --> 05:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
to establish an ambulatory Surgical
 
05:31:55.230 --> 05:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
Center emergency medical care center
 
05:31:57.310 --> 05:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital Birthing Center dropin or
 
05:31:59.110 --> 05:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
walk-in Care Center dialysis center or
 
05:32:01.030 --> 05:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
special health care service within a
 
05:32:03.110 --> 05:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
15-mile radius of a critical access
 
05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
hospital to give written notice of the
 
05:32:06.990 --> 05:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
intent to establish a healthcare
 
05:32:08.868 --> 05:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
facility with a description of the
 
05:32:10.548 --> 05:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
facility or Special healthc Care Service
 
05:32:12.750 --> 05:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
to the Chief Executive Officer of the
 
05:32:15.868 --> 05:32:15.878 align:start position:0%
hospital by certified mail once a
 
05:32:18.510 --> 05:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
notification is made the critical access
 
05:32:20.470 --> 05:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
hospital has a Time limited opportunity
 
05:32:21.750 --> 05:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
to share with the Department of Health
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and Human Services their concerns about
 
05:32:25.430 --> 05:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
the material adverse impact of the
 
05:32:27.708 --> 05:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
proposed new facility the department
 
05:32:29.350 --> 05:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
would then contract with an independent
 
05:32:31.510 --> 05:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
third party to review and complete a
 
05:32:33.788 --> 05:32:33.798 align:start position:0%
report on those impacts if the report
 
05:32:35.830 --> 05:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
finds the new facility would have an
 
05:32:37.628 --> 05:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
material adverse impact on the critical
 
05:32:39.270 --> 05:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
ACC access Hospital's Financial
 
05:32:41.470 --> 05:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
viability the new facility would not be
 
05:32:44.270 --> 05:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
licensed if the report does not find the
 
05:32:46.030 --> 05:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
new facility has a material adverse
 
05:32:48.190 --> 05:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
impact the new facility would be could
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
be licensed notably the costs for the
 
05:32:52.830 --> 05:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
report by an independent third party are
 
05:32:55.230 --> 05:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
shared equally by the new facility and
 
05:32:57.310 --> 05:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
the critical access Hospital the
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
department may have further Insight on
 
05:33:01.350 --> 05:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
how that process has gone so far uh we
 
05:33:03.150 --> 05:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
continue to believe this is an important
 
05:33:04.868 --> 05:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
process that ensures critical access
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals remain financially viable and
 
05:33:09.230 --> 05:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
able to m main vital services in their
 
05:33:11.548 --> 05:33:11.558 align:start position:0%
communities for these reasons we do not
 
05:33:14.948 --> 05:33:14.958 align:start position:0%
support HB 223 I'd be happy to answer
 
05:33:14.958 --> 05:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
support HB 223 I'd be happy to answer
your

05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:33:19.350 --> 05:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:33:25.070 --> 05:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so similar what I
 
05:33:30.390 --> 05:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
was trying uh to ask honorable uh mror
 
05:33:34.190 --> 05:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh about do you have a number of
 
05:33:38.150 --> 05:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
potential losses for a critical access
 
05:33:41.788 --> 05:33:41.798 align:start position:0%
Hospital like what percentage of paying
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
clients they could lose or like in their
 
05:33:49.628 --> 05:33:49.638 align:start position:0%
General Revenue how much they could lose
 
05:33:53.548 --> 05:33:53.558 align:start position:0%
if this becomes a low well in fact the
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
existing statute affords the opportunity
 
05:33:58.350 --> 05:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Health and Human
 
05:34:00.590 --> 05:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
Services to contract with an independent
 
05:34:03.470 --> 05:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
third party to make those determinations
 
05:34:05.548 --> 05:34:05.558 align:start position:0%
and decide whether or not it has an
 
05:34:07.830 --> 05:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
adverse impact on the existing critical
 
05:34:10.990 --> 05:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
axis hospital and so to your question I
 
05:34:14.110 --> 05:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
don't have that information but I assume
 
05:34:16.628 --> 05:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
that if there was a proposal that would
 
05:34:19.390 --> 05:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
be contemplated and disclosed in order
 
05:34:21.150 --> 05:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
to make the decision on the adverse
 
05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
impact as intended by the existing
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
statute other
 
05:34:30.750 --> 05:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not seeing any oh I'm
 
05:34:33.070 --> 05:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I representative TZ uh we've heard
 
05:34:34.910 --> 05:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
a lot oh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh we've
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
heard a lot
 
05:34:40.270 --> 05:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
about the importance of critical access
 
05:34:42.628 --> 05:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
hospitals and how they're I I like the
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
way you really uh describe low patient
 
05:34:49.110 --> 05:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
volume uh lower uh private payer mix
 
05:34:51.990 --> 05:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
lower uh rates of hospitalizations and
 
05:34:54.430 --> 05:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
yet having higher costs and having to be
 
05:34:56.628 --> 05:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
able to be available what kinds of
 
05:34:59.788 --> 05:34:59.798 align:start position:0%
margins are the hospitals operating at
 
05:35:01.788 --> 05:35:01.798 align:start position:0%
and is there any other information that
 
05:35:04.310 --> 05:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
can help flesh out um our understanding
 
05:35:06.708 --> 05:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
of the urgency of making sure these stay
 
05:35:06.718 --> 05:35:08.708 align:start position:0%
of the urgency of making sure these stay
afloat

05:35:08.708 --> 05:35:08.718 align:start position:0%
afloat
 
05:35:11.270 --> 05:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
um well currently my understanding from
 
05:35:13.948 --> 05:35:13.958 align:start position:0%
recent analysis is that uh Hospital
 
05:35:15.510 --> 05:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New Hampshire are running a
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
negative point4 operating margin uh so
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
they are affected by a lot of what's
 
05:35:22.868 --> 05:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
going on now uh in the regulatory
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
environment and and other uh pressures
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
on the cost of providing care thank you
 
05:35:32.750 --> 05:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
okay um no one else has signed up to
 
05:35:42.910 --> 05:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
testify in HP 223 I'm sensing no one
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
else wishes to is that correct okay that
 
05:35:47.110 --> 05:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
being the case I'm going to close the
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
223 that was the last uh Bill we had
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
scheduled for public hearings today we
 
05:35:58.350 --> 05:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
do have an executive session coming up
 
05:36:00.270 --> 05:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
um and I guess the question to the
 
05:36:02.030 --> 05:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee would be do we want to take a
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
quick break or do we want to proceed
 
05:36:06.868 --> 05:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
immediately quick bre quick break 10
 
05:36:10.868 --> 05:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
minutes is that enough five yes five we
 
05:36:13.830 --> 05:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
gotta get we got to get more okay oh

05:51:20.190 --> 05:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
any of you wish to speak about the
 
05:51:21.468 --> 05:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
efforts of the subcommittee you want to
 
05:51:21.478 --> 05:51:26.430 align:start position:0%
efforts of the subcommittee you want to
speak

05:51:26.430 --> 05:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:29.590 --> 05:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
firstes okay representative Kofa uh yes
 
05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
thank you so I had initially had some
 
05:51:36.150 --> 05:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
concerns that um the combination of
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
Highly regulated plus profit motive
 
05:51:42.590 --> 05:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
could potentially be a magnet for
 
05:51:45.868 --> 05:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
um people's who whose whose motives were
 
05:51:49.110 --> 05:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
not um necessarily aligned with what New
 
05:51:51.270 --> 05:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been trying to do with
 
05:51:54.788 --> 05:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis however in the work
 
05:51:56.788 --> 05:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
session we were able to drill down to a
 
05:51:59.948 --> 05:51:59.958 align:start position:0%
much more detailed level and I I came to
 
05:52:01.548 --> 05:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that there are some very
 
05:52:04.590 --> 05:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
serious problems some of those problems
 
05:52:07.628 --> 05:52:07.638 align:start position:0%
um result in patients either going to
 
05:52:11.110 --> 05:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
neighboring states to uh to to purchase
 
05:52:14.030 --> 05:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis or buying buying it off the
 
05:52:16.910 --> 05:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
street which I think is an increasingly
 
05:52:21.390 --> 05:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous proposition so um I I guess I
 
05:52:23.948 --> 05:52:23.958 align:start position:0%
I feel like my concerns about what might
 
05:52:27.548 --> 05:52:27.558 align:start position:0%
potentially be are far outweighed by the
 
05:52:30.150 --> 05:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
very real problems that exist today for
 
05:52:32.430 --> 05:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
those who are trying to help people uh
 
05:52:37.548 --> 05:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
with with medical cannabis so um I I am
 
05:52:39.390 --> 05:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
you know at this point you know having
 
05:52:41.468 --> 05:52:41.478 align:start position:0%
having been uh on the fence I am at this
 
05:52:44.070 --> 05:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
point pretty strongly in support of a to
 
05:52:45.350 --> 05:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
pass on this
 
05:52:48.070 --> 05:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill representative L Nagel do you wish
 
05:52:51.948 --> 05:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
to speak to the motion of a to pass
 
05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
or representative Woods you okay yeah um
 
05:52:58.430 --> 05:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
I just just to add that uh to what
 
05:53:00.788 --> 05:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt said uh we also
 
05:53:03.628 --> 05:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
considered are the proper guidelines all
 
05:53:07.948 --> 05:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
still in place and indeed uh the the
 
05:53:12.548 --> 05:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
guard rails uh don't change uh at all uh
 
05:53:16.548 --> 05:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
so I I think u in terms of the the
 
05:53:19.590 --> 05:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
initial uh purpose was to provide a
 
05:53:23.670 --> 05:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
product that was for patient benefit um
 
05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
in view of the fact that it was still a
 
05:53:27.628 --> 05:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
schedule one uh um
 
05:53:31.030 --> 05:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
medication uh that is I think been
 
05:53:33.548 --> 05:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
satisfied both from the standpoint of
 
05:53:35.830 --> 05:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
providing a better Financial environment
 
05:53:38.468 --> 05:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
so that they can the New Hampshire can
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
be competitive with Maine and and
 
05:53:45.390 --> 05:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh but also uh HHS has been
 
05:53:48.430 --> 05:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
very having at one point been a on the
 
05:53:51.628 --> 05:53:51.638 align:start position:0%
board uh very strict uh in their uh
 
05:53:53.830 --> 05:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring of these programs I think the
 
05:53:56.070 --> 05:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines are are uh and guard rails
 
05:53:59.190 --> 05:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
are still uh very much uh in place and
 
05:54:03.830 --> 05:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
Will preserve that aspect U for uh this
 
05:54:09.030 --> 05:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
particular um endeavor um I did offer
 
05:54:13.310 --> 05:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
one other concern uh perhaps not totally
 
05:54:17.350 --> 05:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
appropo of this bill per se but the
 
05:54:21.030 --> 05:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
viability U of of these entities are
 
05:54:24.270 --> 05:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
sort of what's in question uh my real
 
05:54:28.230 --> 05:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
concern is uh the environment of of uh
 
05:54:30.750 --> 05:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
relooking at all
 
05:54:34.830 --> 05:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
aspects uh of government U interactions
 
05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh and realizing that it's even even
 
05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
though still a schedule one it's only by
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
executive order uh that the doj uh was
 
05:54:48.830 --> 05:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
directed not to prosecute if in fact
 
05:54:51.990 --> 05:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
entities were uh supplying Services
 
05:54:56.110 --> 05:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
under a guidance of State legislation uh
 
05:54:59.110 --> 05:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
and appropriate guidelines
 
05:55:02.350 --> 05:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
therein given the reviews that are going
 
05:55:05.868 --> 05:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
on uh I think there is at least some
 
05:55:05.878 --> 05:55:07.150 align:start position:0%
on uh I think there is at least some
risk

05:55:07.150 --> 05:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
risk
 
05:55:09.510 --> 05:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
because if that were ever to be
 
05:55:12.350 --> 05:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
rescinded uh that would completely undo
 
05:55:15.190 --> 05:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
this program uh and all programs across
 
05:55:15.200 --> 05:55:16.548 align:start position:0%
this program uh and all programs across
the

05:55:16.548 --> 05:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:55:19.390 --> 05:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
country thank you representative Nagel
 
05:55:23.948 --> 05:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments sure um this I
 
05:55:25.628 --> 05:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
really you know appreciate what the
 
05:55:27.350 --> 05:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
state tried to do in creating this
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
program there were models in Arizona and
 
05:55:32.868 --> 05:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
um Colorado in terms of the initial
 
05:55:35.310 --> 05:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
Recreation or therapeutic cannabis laws
 
05:55:37.948 --> 05:55:37.958 align:start position:0%
that were really gross ly flawed so they
 
05:55:39.990 --> 05:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to avoid the mistakes that were
 
05:55:41.868 --> 05:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
made in other states they thought they
 
05:55:43.590 --> 05:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
could do that by forcing it to be
 
05:55:45.590 --> 05:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
functionally a nonprofit the problem is
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
that they forced it to be a nonprofit
 
05:55:49.030 --> 05:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
without any of the benefits that go with
 
05:55:51.990 --> 05:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
being nonprofit meaning that you know
 
05:55:54.990 --> 05:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
they couldn't uh declare 5 1c3 status or
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
anything like that and the problem is it
 
05:55:58.430 --> 05:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
really adversely affected their ability
 
05:56:00.350 --> 05:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
to get funding um representative woods
 
05:56:02.430 --> 05:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
and I had both were on the testical
 
05:56:04.110 --> 05:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
board at one time and I'm on the
 
05:56:05.910 --> 05:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
05:56:08.548 --> 05:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
board so we have some privy knowledge to
 
05:56:10.390 --> 05:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
the finances and all I could think of
 
05:56:11.830 --> 05:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
was I don't know how these places are
 
05:56:14.270 --> 05:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
surviving and the problem is is because
 
05:56:15.990 --> 05:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
they can't raise revenue they have to
 
05:56:17.708 --> 05:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
get it in other ways at high interest
 
05:56:19.670 --> 05:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
rates and the cost gets passed on to the
 
05:56:21.270 --> 05:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
consumer which means that the price is
 
05:56:22.830 --> 05:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
eternally high and there's no way you're
 
05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to bring it down which means
 
05:56:26.628 --> 05:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
that's why people have to go elsewhere
 
05:56:28.468 --> 05:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
we were also told in the subcommittee
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
session that about 50% of the registered
 
05:56:32.590 --> 05:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
patients in the state can't afford to
 
05:56:34.510 --> 05:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
get it here they go out of state and
 
05:56:37.230 --> 05:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
that's just a a recipe for disaster f um
 
05:56:39.270 --> 05:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
I work with a guy from the NIH and
 
05:56:41.390 --> 05:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
they're working really worried about um
 
05:56:43.910 --> 05:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
fentanyl tainted cannabis down in the DC
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
area and he asked me very specifically
 
05:56:47.430 --> 05:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
if we're seeing that here and I said I
 
05:56:48.868 --> 05:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
have not personally but I'm sure it's
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
going to happen so we need to do
 
05:56:52.510 --> 05:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do to prevent that
 
05:56:54.390 --> 05:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
this will allow us to provide high
 
05:56:56.948 --> 05:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
quality product hopefully at lower cost
 
05:57:00.670 --> 05:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
um um and save our patients so that's
 
05:57:03.030 --> 05:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
why we came to the conclusion we did any
 
05:57:06.310 --> 05:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
other discussion on this motion
 
05:57:09.350 --> 05:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none motion is ought to pass

yes Ann bill it's an FN it's an early
 
05:58:07.310 --> 05:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
bill right I believe
 
05:58:08.670 --> 05:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
representative we that would have to go
 
05:58:11.868 --> 05:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
to finance right Mr well the question is
 
05:58:15.868 --> 05:58:15.878 align:start position:0%
can it go on the consent calendar if if
 
05:58:21.910 --> 05:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh it used to be the rule used to be um
 
05:58:23.948 --> 05:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
if there was no appropriation that could
 
05:58:25.590 --> 05:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
go on the pent
 
05:58:28.948 --> 05:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
but me says it's over 10,000 so I
 
05:58:31.830 --> 05:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
probably just thank you representative
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
McKay but I don't think they'll let us
 
05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
have that argument right vote is 18 to
 
05:58:39.270 --> 05:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
zero motion passes okay and again
 
05:58:40.788 --> 05:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
because it's an early Bill it'll it'll
 
05:58:42.590 --> 05:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
go on regular
 
05:58:46.150 --> 05:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
calendar okay next up is House Bill 392
 
05:58:48.030 --> 05:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
representative mea do you have a
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you Mr chair I'd like
 
05:58:55.548 --> 05:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
to make a motion to retain HB 392 dfn
 
05:58:58.708 --> 05:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
representative Drew second uh would you
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion
 
05:59:01.750 --> 05:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative Amer I will keep it very
 
05:59:03.948 --> 05:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
short and sweet
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
um it would just feels like we need to
 
05:59:09.310 --> 05:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
do a lot more uh research and and
 
05:59:09.320 --> 05:59:10.548 align:start position:0%
do a lot more uh research and and
digging

05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
digging
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
into there's just a lot of information
 
05:59:15.190 --> 05:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
we feel like we still need and some
 
05:59:18.110 --> 05:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
things that aren't necessarily answered
 
05:59:20.670 --> 05:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
yet and that we would like uh a bunch
 
05:59:23.750 --> 05:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
more time to to do that
 
05:59:26.750 --> 05:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
research um and I personally would like
 
05:59:27.990 --> 05:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
to do that as
 
05:59:31.390 --> 05:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
well any other
 
05:59:33.990 --> 05:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
05:59:36.390 --> 05:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
kall uh thank you I I agree age with
 
05:59:38.230 --> 05:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
that statement I'm also concerned that
 
05:59:42.708 --> 05:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
we might um be eliminating some some
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
positions or work that is quite
 
05:59:48.310 --> 05:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
important to some people in New
 
05:59:50.788 --> 05:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in other words I I'm
 
05:59:53.708 --> 05:59:53.718 align:start position:0%
concerned that this bill you know if we
 
05:59:55.708 --> 05:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
if we send it on to the floor and gets a
 
05:59:57.350 --> 05:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
house vote that we could have some
 
05:59:59.230 --> 05:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and I think it
 
06:00:01.468 --> 06:00:01.478 align:start position:0%
would be it's incumbent upon us as a
 
06:00:03.430 --> 06:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee to do that research and be
 
06:00:07.468 --> 06:00:07.478 align:start position:0%
well informed uh before we send it on
 
06:00:10.150 --> 06:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
and representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
06:00:13.110 --> 06:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
chair I just was watching A Few Good Men
 
06:00:16.868 --> 06:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
last night um for the 5,000th time and I
 
06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
was listening to the end and of course
 
06:00:21.190 --> 06:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
Jack Nicholson's speech is supposed to
 
06:00:24.390 --> 06:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
be the cresendo and but but it's not
 
06:00:26.830 --> 06:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
it's what happens after that it's when
 
06:00:30.030 --> 06:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh Lieutenant um Colonel or whatever
 
06:00:33.390 --> 06:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
Lance Coral Dawson says um he goes you
 
06:00:36.150 --> 06:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
know our role as Marines is to fight for
 
06:00:38.590 --> 06:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
those who can't fight for themselves
 
06:00:40.510 --> 06:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
which is functionally a a a more
 
06:00:42.310 --> 06:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
American statement of the story of the
 
06:00:44.310 --> 06:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
Good Samaritan and the greatest
 
06:00:46.270 --> 06:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
commandment and I was really impressed
 
06:00:48.750 --> 06:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
with that and as I looked through what
 
06:00:51.990 --> 06:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
this department does um they do do a lot
 
06:00:55.030 --> 06:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
of really good things for people and um
 
06:00:57.430 --> 06:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
I think this bill by itself as it's
 
06:00:59.708 --> 06:00:59.718 align:start position:0%
written now is potentially has a lot of
 
06:01:03.070 --> 06:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
unintended harmful consequences and i
 
06:01:03.080 --> 06:01:04.070 align:start position:0%
unintended harmful consequences and i
would

06:01:04.070 --> 06:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:01:06.270 --> 06:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
support what we're talking about about
 
06:01:08.670 --> 06:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
here but we have to remember the good
 
06:01:10.910 --> 06:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
that these people do for a lot of other
 
06:01:12.590 --> 06:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
people that really can't fight for
 
06:01:12.600 --> 06:01:13.910 align:start position:0%
people that really can't fight for
themselves

06:01:13.910 --> 06:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
06:01:16.868 --> 06:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative Woods thank
 
06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
you yes I I like to emphasize that I too
 
06:01:23.110 --> 06:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
feel that uh there some significant risk
 
06:01:24.830 --> 06:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
of unintended
 
06:01:28.708 --> 06:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
consequences um unfortunately words do
 
06:01:31.390 --> 06:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
have meaning but when the words aren't
 
06:01:33.910 --> 06:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
well defined especially in our culture
 
06:01:35.510 --> 06:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
today a lot of the words are not well
 
06:01:35.520 --> 06:01:36.548 align:start position:0%
today a lot of the words are not well
defined

06:01:36.548 --> 06:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
defined
 
06:01:38.788 --> 06:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
readings to a lot of emotional
 
06:01:42.510 --> 06:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
reactions and I in physics you always
 
06:01:44.190 --> 06:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
look at the outlier to give you an
 
06:01:46.750 --> 06:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
example and I tell ask my
 
06:01:50.190 --> 06:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
kids what's what's the worst conceivable
 
06:01:53.030 --> 06:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
word you could have spoken in 13th
 
06:01:55.788 --> 06:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
century Germany of course they don't
 
06:01:59.788 --> 06:01:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:02.670 --> 06:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
zoom of course it has no consequence
 
06:02:06.510 --> 06:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
today but words do have consequence even
 
06:02:08.670 --> 06:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
though it was the worst thing you could
 
06:02:11.230 --> 06:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
say in 13th century
 
06:02:14.430 --> 06:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
Germany words now might have the
 
06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
flipflop and so I I really really do
 
06:02:19.788 --> 06:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
support uh taking a look at this and I I
 
06:02:21.350 --> 06:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
completely agree I think we could make
 
06:02:23.390 --> 06:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
this a lot
 
06:02:29.270 --> 06:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
better thank you anyone else any other
 
06:02:31.868 --> 06:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Weber I'll
 
06:02:33.510 --> 06:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
just say my my preference would have
 
06:02:35.110 --> 06:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
been to kill the bill outright but I
 
06:02:38.670 --> 06:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
certainly app Claud the desire to know
 
06:02:40.510 --> 06:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're talking about and
 
06:02:43.190 --> 06:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what the consequences are and so
 
06:02:45.310 --> 06:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
I will certainly support the retention
 
06:02:46.948 --> 06:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
and do the work I was leaning in that
 
06:02:49.270 --> 06:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
direction myself actually but
 
06:02:51.510 --> 06:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel just sorry I wanted
 
06:02:52.990 --> 06:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
to make one more comment just because
 
06:02:55.150 --> 06:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair of the State Health
 
06:02:57.868 --> 06:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
assessment um committee implementation
 
06:02:59.628 --> 06:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
plan committee it's longer than that but
 
06:03:02.310 --> 06:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
anyways um when I looked at the original
 
06:03:04.350 --> 06:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
document that had been created before I
 
06:03:06.350 --> 06:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
got there the word equity Healthcare
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
Equity appeared dozens of times in the
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
document and um you know I sat down at
 
06:03:14.230 --> 06:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
one of our first meetings and I said
 
06:03:16.670 --> 06:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
what does the word Equity even mean so I
 
06:03:19.350 --> 06:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
dug this up from Stanford and they said
 
06:03:21.390 --> 06:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
most committees that use that word have
 
06:03:23.230 --> 06:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
no clear definition of what they're
 
06:03:26.510 --> 06:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
talking about and and I think that we
 
06:03:29.230 --> 06:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
spent a total of two days trying to
 
06:03:31.270 --> 06:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
figure out what that word meant to us
 
06:03:32.830 --> 06:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
and I think we came up with a really
 
06:03:35.350 --> 06:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
good working uh definition but I think
 
06:03:39.230 --> 06:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
that word is so unclear it's so visceral
 
06:03:41.670 --> 06:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
and it's so problematic that maybe we
 
06:03:43.390 --> 06:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
need to include as part of our
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
discussion going forward how we want to
 
06:03:48.350 --> 06:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
use that word um and make it productive
 
06:03:50.190 --> 06:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
so that people don't get harmed by our
 
06:03:51.468 --> 06:03:51.478 align:start position:0%
interpretation I mentioned to some of
 
06:03:52.830 --> 06:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
you earlier
 
06:03:56.270 --> 06:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
today Governor Mel Thompson arguably I
 
06:03:57.868 --> 06:03:57.878 align:start position:0%
mean everybody knows who Mel Thompson
 
06:04:00.150 --> 06:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
was in his reputation the name of his
 
06:04:04.350 --> 06:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
company was Equity publishing so uh so
 
06:04:06.510 --> 06:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
that mean that name that word can mean a
 
06:04:08.390 --> 06:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
lot of things representative kofalt did
 
06:04:11.030 --> 06:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
you have a hand up ear did someone have
 
06:04:13.868 --> 06:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
you oh I'm sorry representative Tes
 
06:04:16.390 --> 06:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I would say
 
06:04:17.868 --> 06:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
that there's no question about a
 
06:04:20.510 --> 06:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
definition of Health Equity it um we
 
06:04:22.750 --> 06:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
just haven't had a conversation about it
 
06:04:25.628 --> 06:04:25.638 align:start position:0%
we heard over two hours of testimony
 
06:04:27.230 --> 06:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
with only one person in support
 
06:04:29.948 --> 06:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
including um representative Jess Edwards
 
06:04:31.830 --> 06:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
we also received almost
 
06:04:36.150 --> 06:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
3,000 um uh indications of people in
 
06:04:39.310 --> 06:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill so I don't really
 
06:04:40.910 --> 06:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
understand why we think there's much to
 
06:04:43.990 --> 06:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
study we we heard a lot about how it
 
06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
could be harmful for many different
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
kinds of organizations and individuals
 
06:04:51.548 --> 06:04:51.558 align:start position:0%
providing testimony so um I don't agree
 
06:04:55.548 --> 06:04:55.558 align:start position:0%
that uh talking about it further as
 
06:04:58.150 --> 06:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
needed uh representative
 
06:05:01.270 --> 06:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
mlan just you know to to respond to
 
06:05:03.190 --> 06:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative t as to why I think
 
06:05:05.868 --> 06:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
retention is important you know I I I
 
06:05:08.948 --> 06:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
agree with a lot of what you say but
 
06:05:11.910 --> 06:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
because there is a broader perception
 
06:05:13.948 --> 06:05:13.958 align:start position:0%
and in some quarters a negative
 
06:05:17.070 --> 06:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
perception of what Dei is if we don't
 
06:05:19.310 --> 06:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
retain this it could potentially go to
 
06:05:23.590 --> 06:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
the floor and pass and um there are some
 
06:05:25.750 --> 06:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences here that we
 
06:05:28.708 --> 06:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to allow that to happen so
 
06:05:31.468 --> 06:05:31.478 align:start position:0%
this I think you know um I think
 
06:05:34.030 --> 06:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
representative Woods nailed it and
 
06:05:37.390 --> 06:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
retention is is the smart
 
06:05:40.468 --> 06:05:40.478 align:start position:0%
go any other
 
06:05:42.788 --> 06:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
discussion if there was no no other
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
discussion I would ask the clerk to call
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%

yes remember representative Weber when I
 
06:06:51.070 --> 06:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
used to do that to barara Griffin
 
06:06:53.310 --> 06:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin and we
 
06:06:54.910 --> 06:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
districting committee all
 
06:06:57.390 --> 06:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
the I mean did Karen to rewrite this so
 
06:07:01.590 --> 06:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:05.788 --> 06:07:05.798 align:start position:0%
but okay well I'll have to try harder
 
06:07:08.670 --> 06:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
vote uh 17 to1 yeah the final vote is 17
 
06:07:11.110 --> 06:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
to1 motion passes the motion is retained
 
06:07:13.468 --> 06:07:13.478 align:start position:0%
s the bill is retained 17
 
06:07:17.150 --> 06:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
to1 okay next up and um we we were
 
06:07:20.548 --> 06:07:20.558 align:start position:0%
thinking about perhaps dealing with HB
 
06:07:23.948 --> 06:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
634 today certainly open for discussion
 
06:07:25.468 --> 06:07:25.478 align:start position:0%
at least as to what we want to do with
 
06:07:28.270 --> 06:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
it there is an amendment that has been
 
06:07:33.868 --> 06:07:33.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:43.110 --> 06:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:47.430 --> 06:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
also um I will um I will say that I have
 
06:07:49.310 --> 06:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
received a number of calls unsolicited
 
06:07:52.670 --> 06:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
from the parents of artistic children
 
06:07:55.708 --> 06:07:55.718 align:start position:0%
who think that the this uh Council
 
06:07:58.350 --> 06:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
should be repealed um altogether it
 
06:08:01.590 --> 06:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't met since 2019 and they feel it's
 
06:08:03.350 --> 06:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
been very unresponsive and ineffective
 
06:08:04.830 --> 06:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
but representative kofalt you've been
 
06:08:06.910 --> 06:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
more involved in this
 
06:08:10.030 --> 06:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
issue thank you Mr chairman so um I too
 
06:08:13.708 --> 06:08:13.718 align:start position:0%
reached out to uh some of the uh parents
 
06:08:17.110 --> 06:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
of autistic uh children and adults whom
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
I know and they uh without exception
 
06:08:25.628 --> 06:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
said that you know the the the work that
 
06:08:25.638 --> 06:08:26.390 align:start position:0%
said that you know the the the work that
is

06:08:26.390 --> 06:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:08:29.910 --> 06:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
described in the statute for the um for
 
06:08:33.430 --> 06:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
this council is duplicative of work um
 
06:08:34.910 --> 06:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
that is described in a different section
 
06:08:39.750 --> 06:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
of statute for the uh quality Council um
 
06:08:43.430 --> 06:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
I I applaud the sponsors um desire to
 
06:08:46.590 --> 06:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
put um some some people on the council
 
06:08:48.548 --> 06:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
with disabilities or family members of
 
06:08:49.628 --> 06:08:49.638 align:start position:0%
people with
 
06:08:52.910 --> 06:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities um or on the on the
 
06:08:56.468 --> 06:08:56.478 align:start position:0%
Spectrum uh the the quality Council
 
06:09:00.670 --> 06:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
already has that and um is has been
 
06:09:03.070 --> 06:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
active the this Council has not met
 
06:09:05.868 --> 06:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
since 2019 has not delivered an annual
 
06:09:07.430 --> 06:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
report since
 
06:09:12.150 --> 06:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
2017 um and if you read the two statutes
 
06:09:13.990 --> 06:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
two sections of stat well if you read
 
06:09:17.430 --> 06:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
the statute on the quality Council and
 
06:09:20.270 --> 06:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
the original version of Bill or the
 
06:09:22.708 --> 06:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
house bill 6304 as
 
06:09:25.070 --> 06:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
filed although the wording is different
 
06:09:27.070 --> 06:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
the mission is very much the same it's
 
06:09:28.868 --> 06:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
about how can we serve people with
 
06:09:30.670 --> 06:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
Autism Spectrum disorders more
 
06:09:33.990 --> 06:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
effectively and so I I simply think that
 
06:09:36.110 --> 06:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
that it that it's duplicative
 
06:09:38.110 --> 06:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
um we ought to be furthering the work of
 
06:09:40.270 --> 06:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
the council that is already doing this
 
06:09:43.350 --> 06:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
work rather than um sort of re Reviving
 
06:09:46.430 --> 06:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
a council that has not met in um in five
 
06:09:48.708 --> 06:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
years and hasn't filed an annual report
 
06:09:52.230 --> 06:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
in seven representative Weber thank you
 
06:09:55.830 --> 06:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I think um I'm not sure
 
06:09:58.190 --> 06:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm where I am on this at this
 
06:10:01.030 --> 06:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
moment because uh I thought we had some
 
06:10:03.030 --> 06:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
pretty strong pleas from Representatives
 
06:10:06.548 --> 06:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
Stringham and Edwards that uh with these
 
06:10:09.110 --> 06:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
revisions the council would be able to
 
06:10:11.150 --> 06:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
complete what sounded to me at that
 
06:10:15.990 --> 06:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
point like a relatively limited um um
 
06:10:19.788 --> 06:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
Mission and um I'd love a chance to chat
 
06:10:21.548 --> 06:10:21.558 align:start position:0%
with them and maybe some other people
 
06:10:24.468 --> 06:10:24.478 align:start position:0%
before we dismiss it out of hand so I
 
06:10:26.310 --> 06:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
was wondering if we could defer it for a
 
06:10:29.990 --> 06:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
week and you know at that point uh we
 
06:10:31.670 --> 06:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
might have a little more information
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
going forward all right and and in
 
06:10:37.468 --> 06:10:37.478 align:start position:0%
regards to that then why don't we
 
06:10:39.708 --> 06:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
continue uh that discussion and defer it
 
06:10:46.190 --> 06:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:49.030 --> 06:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh yes representative Woods um uh
 
06:10:51.110 --> 06:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
could representative K he said there's
 
06:10:54.430 --> 06:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
an that would be duplicative of uh could
 
06:10:58.150 --> 06:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
you provide us what that entity and some
 
06:11:01.150 --> 06:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
linkage or some some way we can look at
 
06:11:04.150 --> 06:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
that I will be happy to send a link I
 
06:11:07.830 --> 06:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:11.830 --> 06:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
um the quality council
 
06:11:14.548 --> 06:11:14.558 align:start position:0%
is RSA
 
06:11:14.558 --> 06:11:18.350 align:start position:0%
is RSA
171a

06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:21.628 --> 06:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
33 and so if you do in the and there is
 
06:11:24.948 --> 06:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
a a web page for it as well so if you if
 
06:11:26.948 --> 06:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
you do I mean I I I will send the link
 
06:11:29.990 --> 06:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
out to the committee um but if you if
 
06:11:32.868 --> 06:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
you read 171
 
06:11:36.230 --> 06:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
a33 um
 
06:11:39.468 --> 06:11:39.478 align:start position:0%
section four um you'll you'll see that
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
it again it's it's different language
 
06:11:45.510 --> 06:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
but it's it's very much the same kind of
 
06:11:47.510 --> 06:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
effort that that we see in the in the
 
06:11:51.070 --> 06:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:57.390 --> 06:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:57.400 --> 06:11:59.310 align:start position:0%
 
634

06:11:59.310 --> 06:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
634
 
06:12:04.150 --> 06:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
33 he none uh let's move on to HB 724 FN
 
06:12:05.468 --> 06:12:05.478 align:start position:0%
representative Drew did you have a
 
06:12:09.270 --> 06:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
motion on that I move to itl HB 724
 
06:12:12.548 --> 06:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
representative merer I second I wish to
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:18.270 --> 06:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
Dr yes uh the
 
06:12:20.788 --> 06:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
06:12:23.990 --> 06:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I guess Republicans in the committee
 
06:12:24.000 --> 06:12:24.670 align:start position:0%
um I guess Republicans in the committee
at

06:12:24.670 --> 06:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:12:29.628 --> 06:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
least we we felt that this bill was
 
06:12:33.948 --> 06:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
excessively um punishing of landlords uh
 
06:12:37.868 --> 06:12:37.878 align:start position:0%
especially the option or the the the
 
06:12:39.788 --> 06:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
procedure that allows that or
 
06:12:42.270 --> 06:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
essentially forces the inspection of all
 
06:12:44.270 --> 06:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the units in a building when a
 
06:12:46.990 --> 06:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
particular uh lead issue is found in one
 
06:12:49.788 --> 06:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
of those units uh this is very expensive
 
06:12:52.310 --> 06:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh also in the testimony it came out
 
06:12:53.830 --> 06:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
that even if
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
these uh dangers are abated for this
 
06:13:00.150 --> 06:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
excessive cost it's not fully under the
 
06:13:02.030 --> 06:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
landlord's control to stop it from being
 
06:13:04.310 --> 06:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
reintroduced into the apartment uh
 
06:13:07.750 --> 06:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
because the the one of the testimony um
 
06:13:09.110 --> 06:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
one of the testimonies talked about
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
simply moving some furniture around
 
06:13:14.750 --> 06:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
could cause that lead Hazard to
 
06:13:18.628 --> 06:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
reappear uh in the in the uh unit and so
 
06:13:22.590 --> 06:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
we feel that this is too much and it's
 
06:13:24.990 --> 06:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
not there there definitely is a problem
 
06:13:26.230 --> 06:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
we know we have a problem there's a lot
 
06:13:27.750 --> 06:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
of old housing in New Hampshire but this
 
06:13:30.548 --> 06:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
is not the way to address
 
06:13:36.270 --> 06:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:38.110 --> 06:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
I understand that this is an issue that
 
06:13:40.750 --> 06:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
may be of concern to landlords and I've
 
06:13:44.110 --> 06:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
heard them about it over the years
 
06:13:47.910 --> 06:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
endlessly uh but the damage to landlords
 
06:13:50.230 --> 06:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
is economic and the damage to children
 
06:13:51.270 --> 06:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
can be
 
06:13:54.230 --> 06:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
lifelong and so I think anything that we
 
06:13:57.670 --> 06:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
could possibly do
 
06:14:01.628 --> 06:14:01.638 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're giving our kids the
 
06:14:04.070 --> 06:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
best possible start in life is well
 
06:14:05.708 --> 06:14:05.718 align:start position:0%
worth doing
 
06:14:07.750 --> 06:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
um I will note that the signin sheets
 
06:14:07.760 --> 06:14:09.150 align:start position:0%
um I will note that the signin sheets
were

06:14:09.150 --> 06:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:14:13.270 --> 06:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
um um 108 in favor seven opposed one
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
neutral so there's a great deal of
 
06:14:19.270 --> 06:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
support for this bill outside of here as
 
06:14:23.590 --> 06:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:27.310 --> 06:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Woods yes um I
 
06:14:29.510 --> 06:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
I do have concern I understand the
 
06:14:32.990 --> 06:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
economic aspect and uh but U just being
 
06:14:34.510 --> 06:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
very CR about the whole thing we're not
 
06:14:36.070 --> 06:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
here to protect protect somebody's
 
06:14:39.230 --> 06:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
pocketbook as representative rber said
 
06:14:40.990 --> 06:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
we're here to protect the public and
 
06:14:44.948 --> 06:14:44.958 align:start position:0%
their you know uh health and so forth um
 
06:14:48.670 --> 06:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
and in this is is the uh meeting the new
 
06:14:51.788 --> 06:14:51.798 align:start position:0%
standard and that would be uh pushed
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
back so we wouldn't Meet The New
 
06:14:57.190 --> 06:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
National Standard of 3.5 it would remain
 
06:15:00.150 --> 06:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
at five unless we do something else so
 
06:15:03.350 --> 06:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know I understand the economics
 
06:15:05.628 --> 06:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
and I
 
06:15:08.910 --> 06:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
all that uh but uh I I just don't want
 
06:15:12.430 --> 06:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
to lose a 3.5 as the new standard I
 
06:15:14.990 --> 06:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
think that we we really be
 
06:15:17.868 --> 06:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
remiss any other
 
06:15:20.868 --> 06:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
06:15:24.830 --> 06:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
lontine uh well being a residential
 
06:15:27.868 --> 06:15:27.878 align:start position:0%
property provider myself rental property
 
06:15:32.468 --> 06:15:32.478 align:start position:0%
a landlord um I make a lot of my husband
 
06:15:34.390 --> 06:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
and I make a lot of effort to keep
 
06:15:39.230 --> 06:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
apartment in good condition and um if I
 
06:15:41.830 --> 06:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
were to find a child in our
 
06:15:45.030 --> 06:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
building um had high l i mean I would
 
06:15:47.750 --> 06:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
feel it really responsible thing to make
 
06:15:49.788 --> 06:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
sure that other children in the building
 
06:15:53.788 --> 06:15:53.798 align:start position:0%
aren't at risk um I I think we should
 
06:15:56.390 --> 06:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
prioritize the health of the children
 
06:15:58.948 --> 06:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
over the desire of a landlord to not
 
06:16:01.070 --> 06:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
remove risks in the building that they
 
06:16:03.788 --> 06:16:03.798 align:start position:0%
own when it's harming children so I I
 
06:16:06.190 --> 06:16:06.200 align:start position:0%
don't think it's ask asking too much to
 
06:16:08.390 --> 06:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
investigate every unit I think it's
 
06:16:12.110 --> 06:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
entirely appropriate so I won't support
 
06:16:16.070 --> 06:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
the itl oh sure representative Drew as
 
06:16:18.548 --> 06:16:18.558 align:start position:0%
as we discovered in the testimony the
 
06:16:20.030 --> 06:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
risk is not
 
06:16:21.830 --> 06:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
removed when you perform a lead
 
06:16:24.310 --> 06:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
abatement it is it can happen again and
 
06:16:26.070 --> 06:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
again the risk is not removed it may be
 
06:16:28.070 --> 06:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
reduced but the cost of that reduction
 
06:16:31.150 --> 06:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
is extremely high and there are other
 
06:16:34.070 --> 06:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
better ways simpler ways less expensive
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
ways to protect kids and families from
 
06:16:37.600 --> 06:16:40.430 align:start position:0%
ways to protect kids and families from
that

06:16:40.430 --> 06:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:44.190 --> 06:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
exposure representative uh L
 
06:16:47.190 --> 06:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
montain oh well I disagree I think that
 
06:16:49.468 --> 06:16:49.478 align:start position:0%
that was the suggestion that kids are
 
06:16:52.628 --> 06:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
getting lead poisoning from um
 
06:16:54.628 --> 06:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
applesauce Lids or things like that
 
06:16:59.390 --> 06:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
those are extremely rare right the main
 
06:17:02.548 --> 06:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
cause are are are living in
 
06:17:06.430 --> 06:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
Old housing where there's peeling lead
 
06:17:08.990 --> 06:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
paint um so
 
06:17:11.548 --> 06:17:11.558 align:start position:0%
one you know if a if there's a lead
 
06:17:14.230 --> 06:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
abatement occurs and then later there's
 
06:17:16.150 --> 06:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
a little Nick on a stairwell from a
 
06:17:18.310 --> 06:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
piece of furniture being moved that is
 
06:17:20.510 --> 06:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
not likely going to cause a new exposure
 
06:17:23.150 --> 06:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
for children so I disagree with that
 
06:17:26.750 --> 06:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
argument representative Maser I recall
 
06:17:29.830 --> 06:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
to that um from
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
testimony that someone mentioned that
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
when they were going to purchase a house
 
06:17:37.948 --> 06:17:37.958 align:start position:0%
they actually knew it was disclosed um
 
06:17:39.628 --> 06:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
in the report that there was a a
 
06:17:42.430 --> 06:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
presence of lead and but they proceeded
 
06:17:45.468 --> 06:17:45.478 align:start position:0%
to purchase the house anyway so that
 
06:17:48.590 --> 06:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
that then the option then Falls to to
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
the buyer renter whatever because it
 
06:17:52.628 --> 06:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
seems like that is is a thing now that
 
06:17:54.468 --> 06:17:54.478 align:start position:0%
is now reported in there so then the
 
06:17:56.628 --> 06:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
decision can be made on the people
 
06:17:58.390 --> 06:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
buying or
 
06:18:00.708 --> 06:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
renting representative
 
06:18:03.990 --> 06:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
saber they they just um I just to add to
 
06:18:06.230 --> 06:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
that they like when we bought our home
 
06:18:09.150 --> 06:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
they just it's pretty much a a warning
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
saying your home may contain lead
 
06:18:13.510 --> 06:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
because it was built before or after a
 
06:18:16.708 --> 06:18:16.718 align:start position:0%
certain date and so it doesn't really
 
06:18:18.750 --> 06:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
definitively say if you actually have
 
06:18:20.310 --> 06:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
lead or not so I think that's important
 
06:18:24.270 --> 06:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
to point out um another point was um
 
06:18:25.708 --> 06:18:25.718 align:start position:0%
someone who had come the former
 
06:18:27.788 --> 06:18:27.798 align:start position:0%
representative who came to testify in
 
06:18:30.990 --> 06:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
regards to you know um landlords also
 
06:18:32.830 --> 06:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
have the option if they're buying a
 
06:18:35.190 --> 06:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
building and they get that same warant
 
06:18:38.990 --> 06:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know if they ask for a lower price
 
06:18:41.150 --> 06:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
it does have lead you know and bargain
 
06:18:42.990 --> 06:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
at a lower price which would seem
 
06:18:44.750 --> 06:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
economically sound and then put that
 
06:18:48.830 --> 06:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
money into just doing a the abatement um
 
06:18:50.310 --> 06:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's another option as well that was
 
06:18:51.910 --> 06:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
06:18:54.830 --> 06:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
so other
 
06:18:59.230 --> 06:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:01.788 --> 06:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
06:19:07.030 --> 06:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh it it happened to me I have
 
06:19:10.510 --> 06:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
very mixed feelings and I'm worried
 
06:19:10.520 --> 06:19:11.548 align:start position:0%
very mixed feelings and I'm worried
about

06:19:11.548 --> 06:19:11.558 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:19:17.310 --> 06:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
voting uh with without being uh very
 
06:19:22.390 --> 06:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
clear in my mind uh it was hugely
 
06:19:26.190 --> 06:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
expensive it was very traumatic we ended
 
06:19:30.150 --> 06:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
up in court uh so that I think I'm not
 
06:19:33.350 --> 06:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
objective and I don't think I should
 
06:19:36.270 --> 06:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
vote good but you can rule one way or
 
06:19:36.280 --> 06:19:36.990 align:start position:0%
vote good but you can rule one way or
the

06:19:36.990 --> 06:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:19:39.948 --> 06:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
other okay I've never heard of a recusal
 
06:19:45.670 --> 06:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:47.510 --> 06:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
happen no
 
06:19:49.548 --> 06:19:49.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely I've just never run into it
 
06:19:51.548 --> 06:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
before I've never run into I haven't
 
06:19:53.628 --> 06:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
either okay well that makes me feel good
 
06:19:56.548 --> 06:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
then you've never okay that's fine
 
06:19:59.590 --> 06:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative M being thoughtful okay
 
06:20:07.750 --> 06:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:09.868 --> 06:20:09.878 align:start position:0%
I believe so you can
 
06:20:13.590 --> 06:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
abstain we don't have an abion process
 
06:20:16.548 --> 06:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
have to vote have to vote unless you
 
06:20:19.548 --> 06:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
recuse yourself for a particular cause I
 
06:20:21.230 --> 06:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
mean you you I mean I'll be glad to call
 
06:20:24.270 --> 06:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
the perk if you want me to yeah why
 
06:20:26.350 --> 06:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
don't you but I I'm thinking
 
06:20:30.030 --> 06:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
that um I know I know if there's a
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
conflict on a house vote that that you
 
06:20:34.310 --> 06:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
should declare it but on a committee I
 
06:20:49.670 --> 06:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:52.510 --> 06:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
but and again I have no objection I just
 
06:20:55.350 --> 06:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
I've just never went into
 
06:21:00.510 --> 06:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
it um but what why don't we pause just
 
06:21:03.830 --> 06:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
want he's available if he's available it
 
06:21:07.110 --> 06:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
won't take long if isn't available then
 
06:21:12.910 --> 06:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:18.230 --> 06:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:21.788 --> 06:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
okay did give everybody a cell that's
 
06:21:21.798 --> 06:21:39.708 align:start position:0%
okay did give everybody a cell that's
true

06:21:39.708 --> 06:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:53.510 --> 06:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:22.830 --> 06:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:24.628 --> 06:22:24.638 align:start position:0%

06:24:51.070 --> 06:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:53.708 --> 06:24:53.718 align:start position:0%
d0220 a motion is what ought to pass
 
06:24:56.830 --> 06:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass now second you wish to
 
06:24:59.350 --> 06:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yeah so um thank
 
06:25:02.270 --> 06:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so this amendment uh takes
 
06:25:04.910 --> 06:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
we had the subcommittee uh last year
 
06:25:08.468 --> 06:25:08.478 align:start position:0%
where we uh kind of paired down the bill
 
06:25:12.310 --> 06:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
um and we uh got rid of the uh the
 
06:25:15.670 --> 06:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
residential and really uh reduce the
 
06:25:19.430 --> 06:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
scope but uh what the amendment does is
 
06:25:21.468 --> 06:25:21.478 align:start position:0%
the the amendment takes things even
 
06:25:24.430 --> 06:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
further um because what it does is
 
06:25:28.750 --> 06:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
rather than having the second uh like a
 
06:25:32.150 --> 06:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
a new certification process which was in
 
06:25:34.590 --> 06:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
the original bill as introduced after to
 
06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee this basically takes uh
 
06:25:38.638 --> 06:25:39.990 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee this basically takes uh
the

06:25:39.990 --> 06:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:25:44.830 --> 06:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
um takes and rolls it into the existing
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh regulatory framework for health care
 
06:25:49.270 --> 06:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
facilities and so there were real
 
06:25:52.750 --> 06:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities with respect to um
 
06:25:54.868 --> 06:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
efficiencies basically they would just
 
06:25:57.990 --> 06:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
need to have one person for oversight as
 
06:26:00.350 --> 06:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know maybe more people if
 
06:26:01.548 --> 06:26:01.558 align:start position:0%
they're creating a separate
 
06:26:04.350 --> 06:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
certification and it still does retain
 
06:26:07.990 --> 06:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
the position of the uh edsman subject to
 
06:26:11.390 --> 06:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
um available funding so I think overall
 
06:26:14.788 --> 06:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
it basically it keeps the narrowed scope
 
06:26:17.468 --> 06:26:17.478 align:start position:0%
but rolls it into an existing regulatory
 
06:26:19.030 --> 06:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
framework instead of the separate
 
06:26:21.350 --> 06:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
certification much cleaner and I hope
 
06:26:22.750 --> 06:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
you'll support
 
06:26:25.990 --> 06:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative McLean any
 
06:26:31.468 --> 06:26:31.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:38.708 --> 06:26:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:41.230 --> 06:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
we will yeah we will wait for the chair
 
06:26:42.310 --> 06:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
to go
 
06:26:44.788 --> 06:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
further just
 
06:26:47.430 --> 06:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
seeing Christ Grant might have terms of
 
06:26:49.670 --> 06:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
insight on the
 
06:26:49.680 --> 06:26:52.510 align:start position:0%
insight on the
recusal

06:26:52.510 --> 06:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
recusal
 
06:26:59.670 --> 06:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:02.150 --> 06:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
up okay so
 
06:27:04.350 --> 06:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
there's so there's no other discussion
 
06:27:07.948 --> 06:27:07.958 align:start position:0%
on the amendment okay no since there's
 
06:27:09.510 --> 06:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
no other discussion we'll I'll ask the

yes Mr chair I'd like to move a to pass
 
06:28:07.160 --> 06:28:08.430 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair I'd like to move a to pass
as

06:28:08.430 --> 06:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:28:11.230 --> 06:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
amended okay and I'll second do you wish
 
06:28:13.510 --> 06:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yeah thank you
 
06:28:16.830 --> 06:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I think that the testimony
 
06:28:20.110 --> 06:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
that we had last week um was very
 
06:28:23.788 --> 06:28:23.798 align:start position:0%
compelling and and really highlighted
 
06:28:26.070 --> 06:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is genuine need for
 
06:28:29.910 --> 06:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and that just reinforces
 
06:28:34.110 --> 06:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had last year um and
 
06:28:36.590 --> 06:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
especially compelling for me was hearing
 
06:28:38.868 --> 06:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
the woman in Corrections you know who
 
06:28:41.788 --> 06:28:41.798 align:start position:0%
realized to her horror that she had sent
 
06:28:44.830 --> 06:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you know people forever you know
 
06:28:48.548 --> 06:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
in to be taken advantaged of and and and
 
06:28:52.590 --> 06:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
she said that sent her off on an 11-year
 
06:28:55.110 --> 06:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
mission to kind of put some barriers up
 
06:28:57.150 --> 06:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
around substance abuse treatment in this
 
06:29:00.948 --> 06:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
state and and and her comment uh we have
 
06:29:03.190 --> 06:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
never been this close and and and that
 
06:29:05.590 --> 06:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
really moved me and I think renewed my
 
06:29:07.390 --> 06:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
sense of purpose with respect to this
 
06:29:11.150 --> 06:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
bill um last year we said no because it
 
06:29:13.548 --> 06:29:13.558 align:start position:0%
wasn't ready but we did put the work in
 
06:29:15.468 --> 06:29:15.478 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's the difference
 
06:29:17.990 --> 06:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
this year um I know that there are some
 
06:29:20.350 --> 06:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
people that you know are a little bit
 
06:29:23.070 --> 06:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
skeptical about bringing in new
 
06:29:25.750 --> 06:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
regulations I understand that I just got
 
06:29:28.110 --> 06:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
beat up by the committee for two hours
 
06:29:30.270 --> 06:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
about trying to you know go after and
 
06:29:32.750 --> 06:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
and ease back on some regulations but I
 
06:29:36.190 --> 06:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that all regulation
 
06:29:38.868 --> 06:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
is bad there there is a place you know
 
06:29:41.788 --> 06:29:41.798 align:start position:0%
for regulation if if you if you do
 
06:29:44.390 --> 06:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
without any regulation any law you end
 
06:29:46.350 --> 06:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
up with something like the Sudan or
 
06:29:48.350 --> 06:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
Haiti and that just that just kind of
 
06:29:51.310 --> 06:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
breeds tyranny and I think there is a
 
06:29:55.310 --> 06:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
real tyranny um in in in the substance
 
06:29:58.070 --> 06:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
abuse Arena where where people are going
 
06:30:00.670 --> 06:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
in and the Tyranny is is a tyranny of
 
06:30:03.628 --> 06:30:03.638 align:start position:0%
the the Predator uh the abuser and and
 
06:30:07.350 --> 06:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
and even falling into relapse so um I I
 
06:30:09.628 --> 06:30:09.638 align:start position:0%
don't see this bill and and the
 
06:30:12.270 --> 06:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
regulation it brings as being tyrannical
 
06:30:14.670 --> 06:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
I see it as a Defender and I see it as
 
06:30:16.708 --> 06:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
actually providing freedom for some of
 
06:30:19.150 --> 06:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
these people that want to be able to
 
06:30:22.110 --> 06:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
navigate the treatment landscape without
 
06:30:24.948 --> 06:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
fear of being taken advantaged of uh so
 
06:30:27.510 --> 06:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
I do hope that you'll support the bill
 
06:30:29.830 --> 06:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
other discussion representative hartnet
 
06:30:32.350 --> 06:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm a big endorser of this bill and
 
06:30:34.788 --> 06:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh just thinking about alcohol and drug
 
06:30:37.708 --> 06:30:37.718 align:start position:0%
treatment uh regulations we're uh
 
06:30:37.718 --> 06:30:39.190 align:start position:0%
treatment uh regulations we're uh
stunningly

06:30:39.190 --> 06:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
stunningly
 
06:30:41.548 --> 06:30:41.558 align:start position:0%
unregulated in this area we have I
 
06:30:44.230 --> 06:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
believe a ton of work to do in this area
 
06:30:46.110 --> 06:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
if we want to realize an alcohol and
 
06:30:48.590 --> 06:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
drug treatment infrastructure that's
 
06:30:51.510 --> 06:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
integrated into criminal justice child
 
06:30:53.510 --> 06:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
welfare and the broader Health Care
 
06:30:55.590 --> 06:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
system so I think this is certainly a
 
06:30:57.548 --> 06:30:57.558 align:start position:0%
you know a piece of that so I'm a big
 
06:30:59.990 --> 06:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
endorser of this thank you
 
06:31:02.468 --> 06:31:02.478 align:start position:0%
representative uh Nel I just wanted to
 
06:31:04.150 --> 06:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank representative mlan for for all
 
06:31:05.948 --> 06:31:05.958 align:start position:0%
the work that he put into this bill I
 
06:31:08.830 --> 06:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
think he did a fa fabulous job on a very
 
06:31:11.868 --> 06:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
important subject um I've been working
 
06:31:14.110 --> 06:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
with people with mixed chronic pain and
 
06:31:16.190 --> 06:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
drug addiction now for a long period of
 
06:31:19.590 --> 06:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
time and it's very comforting to know
 
06:31:21.750 --> 06:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
that when I make a referral to somebody
 
06:31:23.788 --> 06:31:23.798 align:start position:0%
that I could have some willingness to
 
06:31:25.310 --> 06:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
know or some ability to know that I'm
 
06:31:27.708 --> 06:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
sending them to a quality place um
 
06:31:29.310 --> 06:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
having done pain management for a very
 
06:31:31.230 --> 06:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
long time I'm also aware that the more
 
06:31:33.310 --> 06:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
often you see a late night infomercial
 
06:31:36.948 --> 06:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
or a billboard on a street it kind of
 
06:31:39.510 --> 06:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
reminds you of the unsavory of this area
 
06:31:41.350 --> 06:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
and this is a place where people do try
 
06:31:43.468 --> 06:31:43.478 align:start position:0%
to profit at other people's expense and
 
06:31:44.990 --> 06:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm really glad to see there be some
 
06:31:47.510 --> 06:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
level of oversight so as a practitioner
 
06:31:51.030 --> 06:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
I appreciate this other
 
06:31:53.430 --> 06:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
discussion Yuri uh me representative
 
06:31:54.750 --> 06:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
palazov I'm
 
06:31:58.468 --> 06:31:58.478 align:start position:0%
sorry just uh to reiterate that uh I
 
06:32:01.670 --> 06:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
will be voting against this bill and
 
06:32:04.388 --> 06:32:04.398 align:start position:0%
it's not just because of
 
06:32:07.310 --> 06:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
ation but also because I believe that
 
06:32:09.830 --> 06:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
this bill will lead
 
06:32:13.948 --> 06:32:13.958 align:start position:0%
to potentially to more abuse because uh
 
06:32:18.030 --> 06:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
when the idea was uh born uh last
 
06:32:21.430 --> 06:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
session one of the driving force was a a
 
06:32:26.270 --> 06:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
case that was uh outlined on NH HPR
 
06:32:29.788 --> 06:32:29.798 align:start position:0%
certain step podcast but that case was
 
06:32:33.070 --> 06:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill will increase
 
06:32:34.590 --> 06:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
that case was
 
06:32:39.310 --> 06:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
in facility under DHHS oversight and
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
currently our state is being bankrupt by
 
06:32:47.030 --> 06:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
other cases that were under DHS
 
06:32:50.628 --> 06:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
oversight so and now we are
 
06:32:53.868 --> 06:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
punishing those who were not under DHHS
 
06:32:57.150 --> 06:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
over side by bringing him them in into
 
06:33:00.548 --> 06:33:00.558 align:start position:0%
system uh I think first we need to make
 
06:33:07.110 --> 06:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
sure that the HHS will uh clear up uh
 
06:33:09.150 --> 06:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
facilities under their oversight and
 
06:33:11.270 --> 06:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
then we can increase then we can give
 
06:33:14.350 --> 06:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
them money but this bill will give them
 
06:33:17.030 --> 06:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
more power more money when they like
 
06:33:19.788 --> 06:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
cannot protect people under their
 
06:33:22.830 --> 06:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
oversight so I cannot go alone with it
 
06:33:22.840 --> 06:33:23.788 align:start position:0%
oversight so I cannot go alone with it
thank

06:33:23.788 --> 06:33:23.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:33:26.750 --> 06:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
you other discussion representative
 
06:33:29.788 --> 06:33:29.798 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr chairman so I I too
 
06:33:34.190 --> 06:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
will be voting against this motion I um
 
06:33:36.628 --> 06:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the concerns that have been
 
06:33:39.310 --> 06:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
brought forward I would like to see
 
06:33:41.628 --> 06:33:41.638 align:start position:0%
something uh done about it unfortunately
 
06:33:46.070 --> 06:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
I just don't think that um creating a
 
06:33:48.110 --> 06:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know a whole new category of
 
06:33:50.948 --> 06:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
regulated entities is the answer I did
 
06:33:54.030 --> 06:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
speak to a friend of mine who is U very
 
06:33:56.628 --> 06:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
active in New Hampshire in addiction
 
06:34:00.468 --> 06:34:00.478 align:start position:0%
treatment and um I I was you know it was
 
06:34:02.190 --> 06:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
not a long conversation but I was trying
 
06:34:04.430 --> 06:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
to get a sense of uh
 
06:34:07.270 --> 06:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
whether he felt this was uh a necessary
 
06:34:10.708 --> 06:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
step or not and he uh was very clear
 
06:34:12.430 --> 06:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
that he did not believe that this was
 
06:34:16.628 --> 06:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
necessary and um I I simply don't uh I I
 
06:34:18.430 --> 06:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
think we create a lot of potential
 
06:34:21.628 --> 06:34:21.638 align:start position:0%
problems when we uh when when we add
 
06:34:26.350 --> 06:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
this much um new regulation to
 
06:34:31.910 --> 06:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
um to to an entire domain of of uh
 
06:34:35.788 --> 06:34:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:37.990 --> 06:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none so the motion is ought to
 
06:34:42.868 --> 06:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
pass as amended on HB 751 FN I'll ask
 
06:34:45.190 --> 06:34:45.200 align:start position:0%

yes rep TZ

06:35:45.070 --> 06:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
vote 12 to six motion
 
06:35:46.830 --> 06:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
passes okay is there going to be a
 
06:35:50.750 --> 06:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:54.708 --> 06:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
or I will write a Minority Report
 
06:35:58.270 --> 06:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
okay um who was that Jim kofalt writing
 
06:36:01.670 --> 06:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:04.070 --> 06:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
Report and and mark You're the
 
06:36:05.310 --> 06:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
representative mlan you're writing the
 
06:36:09.430 --> 06:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
majority report right yes sir
 
06:36:11.468 --> 06:36:11.478 align:start position:0%
Mr okay what's the
 
06:36:13.868 --> 06:36:13.878 align:start position:0%
verdict what the clerk said is that it
 
06:36:16.030 --> 06:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
is entirely appropriate to recuse
 
06:36:18.708 --> 06:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
yourself in committee it's it's best if
 
06:36:20.590 --> 06:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
it happens at the very beginning of the
 
06:36:24.070 --> 06:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
process but um there is apparently
 
06:36:27.150 --> 06:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
representative McKay a form that the
 
06:36:30.230 --> 06:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
clerk will need and you can't take part
 
06:36:33.708 --> 06:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
in any part of the process um but
 
06:36:35.990 --> 06:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
recusal in committee is entirely
 
06:36:38.270 --> 06:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate are we able to proceed on
 
06:36:41.310 --> 06:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
that vote then and on that that bill
 
06:36:45.468 --> 06:36:45.478 align:start position:0%
or I think so I I I didn't ask
 
06:36:47.150 --> 06:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
specifically about whether he needs to
 
06:36:49.628 --> 06:36:49.638 align:start position:0%
fill out the form before we take the
 
06:36:52.750 --> 06:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
vote okay I didn't get any sense that it
 
06:36:58.708 --> 06:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:01.830 --> 06:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay well he sat through the hearing
 
06:37:04.270 --> 06:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
well he can sit through the hearing
 
06:37:06.468 --> 06:37:06.478 align:start position:0%
anybody that doesn't anyone I mean the
 
06:37:07.868 --> 06:37:07.878 align:start position:0%
the people who accuse themselves on the
 
06:37:09.230 --> 06:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
floor of the house sit through the house
 
06:37:12.830 --> 06:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
too it's it's questioning um making an
 
06:37:17.230 --> 06:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:20.708 --> 06:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
things okay well um since since that's
 
06:37:22.948 --> 06:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
come up then why don't we go back to 724
 
06:37:26.830 --> 06:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
now representative Drew I moved to itl
 
06:37:31.628 --> 06:37:31.638 align:start position:0%
HB 724 and representative merer I second
 
06:37:33.150 --> 06:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
any other discussion beyond what we've
 
06:37:35.430 --> 06:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
already heard I think representative
 
06:37:37.388 --> 06:37:37.398 align:start position:0%
Nagel this is really more for the
 
06:37:40.788 --> 06:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
landlords in the room but you know if my
 
06:37:42.910 --> 06:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
kid gets exposed to lead gets lead
 
06:37:44.990 --> 06:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
intoxication and I can show it's from
 
06:37:47.070 --> 06:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
the apartment that I'm renting I have
 
06:37:50.310 --> 06:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
legal repercussions don't I don't does
 
06:37:52.708 --> 06:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
that put you at risk as a landlord that
 
06:37:55.150 --> 06:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
that I can come after you with you know
 
06:37:57.270 --> 06:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
pretty hefty lawsuit I would
 
06:38:00.350 --> 06:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
imagine you guys know if it wasn't just
 
06:38:02.788 --> 06:38:02.798 align:start position:0%
yes um speaking as an attorney I think
 
06:38:04.270 --> 06:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
06:38:06.910 --> 06:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
absent of any other circumstances I
 
06:38:10.070 --> 06:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:12.670 --> 06:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuit representative Dr my
 
06:38:13.788 --> 06:38:13.798 align:start position:0%
understanding is that if it wasn't
 
06:38:16.388 --> 06:38:16.398 align:start position:0%
disclosed yes in fact there was a case
 
06:38:18.270 --> 06:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
in Manchester a few years ago that's
 
06:38:20.990 --> 06:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
been on TV that was exactly that there
 
06:38:22.910 --> 06:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
was a young child who got lead poisoning
 
06:38:26.948 --> 06:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
and died and the uh landlord tried to
 
06:38:29.708 --> 06:38:29.718 align:start position:0%
cover it up by faking the forms and
 
06:38:31.270 --> 06:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
essentially got caught and sent to
 
06:38:33.750 --> 06:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
prison so this is like a followup
 
06:38:37.310 --> 06:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
question um would it not be in the
 
06:38:40.548 --> 06:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
landlord's best interests that this law
 
06:38:44.750 --> 06:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:47.430 --> 06:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances there already is law with
 
06:38:49.948 --> 06:38:49.958 align:start position:0%
in terms of lead abatement it's this is
 
06:38:52.190 --> 06:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
adding to the existing law it's not the
 
06:38:55.548 --> 06:38:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:58.548 --> 06:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
there okay any other
 
06:39:00.910 --> 06:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Woods yeah
 
06:39:03.110 --> 06:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
just emphasize that if we vote this down
 
06:39:05.430 --> 06:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
we're also voting down the new lead
 
06:39:08.030 --> 06:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
level there are two things here one
 
06:39:10.788 --> 06:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the financial aspect
 
06:39:13.510 --> 06:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh for the homeowners or for the
 
06:39:16.110 --> 06:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
landlords but we're also we're talking
 
06:39:18.750 --> 06:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
about kids too and creating a new lead
 
06:39:22.430 --> 06:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
level for as a criteria so keep keep
 
06:39:23.350 --> 06:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
that in
 
06:39:27.628 --> 06:39:27.638 align:start position:0%
mind thank you other
 
06:39:30.788 --> 06:39:30.798 align:start position:0%

motion on that uh yes I move in
 
06:41:16.990 --> 06:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on 756
 
06:41:20.670 --> 06:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
FN okay and I'll second that um would
 
06:41:21.990 --> 06:41:22.000 align:start position:0%

um this bill would um established that
 
06:41:32.510 --> 06:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
before entering child care or School a
 
06:41:34.708 --> 06:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
child would have to to
 
06:41:39.350 --> 06:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
um would have to uh be tested for for
 
06:41:41.670 --> 06:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
lead um we already have the requirement
 
06:41:43.230 --> 06:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that children be tested
 
06:41:45.110 --> 06:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
for lead at age 1 and at
 
06:41:49.190 --> 06:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
age2 um furthermore it would impose um
 
06:41:51.110 --> 06:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
some administrative requirements we have
 
06:41:53.628 --> 06:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
heard that that's simply a checkbox but
 
06:41:55.030 --> 06:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
if you read the bill it actually says
 
06:41:58.990 --> 06:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
that child care facilities and schools
 
06:42:01.670 --> 06:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
would be required then to send out
 
06:42:03.830 --> 06:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
notifications to parents
 
06:42:06.510 --> 06:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
um so I do believe that it creates an an
 
06:42:10.350 --> 06:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
additional administrative burden for um
 
06:42:13.708 --> 06:42:13.718 align:start position:0%
for private businesses and schools um
 
06:42:15.548 --> 06:42:15.558 align:start position:0%
and it's something that
 
06:42:17.948 --> 06:42:17.958 align:start position:0%
uh should not be necessary as we're
 
06:42:20.948 --> 06:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
already requiring a lead uh test at ages
 
06:42:23.830 --> 06:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:26.868 --> 06:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
two okay representative
 
06:42:29.388 --> 06:42:29.398 align:start position:0%
Weber I just want to point out that as I
 
06:42:32.110 --> 06:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
read this
 
06:42:34.670 --> 06:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the concerns and I wasn't here
 
06:42:36.150 --> 06:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
for this hearing but we've heard this
 
06:42:39.350 --> 06:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill before uh was that kids wouldn't be
 
06:42:42.350 --> 06:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
admitted to schools and it doesn't say
 
06:42:45.430 --> 06:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
that they have to have if they have not
 
06:42:48.750 --> 06:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
had the lead testing which is required
 
06:42:51.468 --> 06:42:51.478 align:start position:0%
all the school has to do is provide the
 
06:42:54.230 --> 06:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
docu and document the notification to
 
06:42:57.548 --> 06:42:57.558 align:start position:0%
the parent that lead testing is required
 
06:43:01.110 --> 06:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
and um give them educational materials
 
06:43:05.590 --> 06:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:09.830 --> 06:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
lifelong condition and the more we can
 
06:43:15.110 --> 06:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
do to Abate that and ensure that kids
 
06:43:16.628 --> 06:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
arrive at
 
06:43:22.310 --> 06:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
School C well able to learn and become
 
06:43:25.350 --> 06:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
very productive members of society we're
 
06:43:28.830 --> 06:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
going to save ourselves a great deal of
 
06:43:31.708 --> 06:43:31.718 align:start position:0%
payment of other kinds of funds down the
 
06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
line so I think that not passing this
 
06:43:38.388 --> 06:43:38.398 align:start position:0%
bill is not
 
06:43:40.990 --> 06:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
only giving up one more chance at
 
06:43:43.270 --> 06:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
getting that kid taken care of but it's
 
06:43:45.110 --> 06:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
also Penny wise and pound
 
06:43:47.788 --> 06:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
foolish so I will vote against
 
06:43:50.468 --> 06:43:50.478 align:start position:0%
itl representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
06:43:52.590 --> 06:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
chair thanks um you know I'm taking my
 
06:43:57.628 --> 06:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
own question um I I I agree with that um
 
06:43:59.788 --> 06:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
the the ripple effect of lead and sephy
 
06:44:04.270 --> 06:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
opathy Lead intoxication is is scary um
 
06:44:06.350 --> 06:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
the cost ratio for every dollar you
 
06:44:08.388 --> 06:44:08.398 align:start position:0%
spend for the value you save is anywhere
 
06:44:12.110 --> 06:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
from $10 to $200 it's it's it it it to
 
06:44:13.910 --> 06:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
me this seems like a trivial effort to
 
06:44:16.430 --> 06:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
create a really substantial to prevent a
 
06:44:19.830 --> 06:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
really substantial problem um and
 
06:44:22.868 --> 06:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
therefore I'm going to support the it or
 
06:44:25.708 --> 06:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
whatever it is we're voting
 
06:44:27.910 --> 06:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
for against the
 
06:44:29.990 --> 06:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
a representative
 
06:44:32.388 --> 06:44:32.398 align:start position:0%
Weber I also should have mentioned that
 
06:44:35.350 --> 06:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
the signin were 94 in favor seven
 
06:44:46.468 --> 06:44:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:46.478 --> 06:44:48.270 align:start position:0%
 
neutral

06:44:48.270 --> 06:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
06:44:50.788 --> 06:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
represented he was talking while I was
 
06:44:53.150 --> 06:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
sorry I was talking to oh talking to
 
06:44:55.230 --> 06:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
miss Brant repeat like the whole thing
 
06:44:57.270 --> 06:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
well just what your what your end result
 
06:45:01.830 --> 06:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
was that you you I so the the motion is
 
06:45:04.110 --> 06:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
itl correct then I'm going to be
 
06:45:07.270 --> 06:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
opposing that is that what you want to
 
06:45:09.948 --> 06:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
know is that correct
 
06:45:13.070 --> 06:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
yeah this job's too
 
06:45:15.270 --> 06:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
complicated any other discussion
 
06:45:19.510 --> 06:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative Woods uh yes I I to me it
 
06:45:21.070 --> 06:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't go far enough in the sense that
 
06:45:23.868 --> 06:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
this is restricted U to the physical
 
06:45:25.590 --> 06:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
exam part and the
 
06:45:29.430 --> 06:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
initial part is to Public Schools uh to
 
06:45:32.310 --> 06:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
me it should be all schools uh why are
 
06:45:36.270 --> 06:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
we parsing out Public Schools um all the
 
06:45:40.230 --> 06:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
schools should be equally uh
 
06:45:43.788 --> 06:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
impacted any uh representative Lucas um
 
06:45:46.628 --> 06:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
I did make a note during the testimony
 
06:45:49.468 --> 06:45:49.478 align:start position:0%
that approximately 21% of one- yearolds
 
06:45:52.910 --> 06:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
are not being tested currently and 31%
 
06:45:55.590 --> 06:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
of two-year-olds are not being tested so
 
06:45:59.030 --> 06:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
I think a third layer is very helpful
 
06:45:59.040 --> 06:45:59.948 align:start position:0%
I think a third layer is very helpful
thank

06:45:59.948 --> 06:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:46:05.150 --> 06:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:09.070 --> 06:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh I was impressed that uh
 
06:46:11.670 --> 06:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
Jackie Cowell who is a really well
 
06:46:14.670 --> 06:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
regged person in the early childhood
 
06:46:18.510 --> 06:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
World um suggested that this would make
 
06:46:21.708 --> 06:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
more sense if it happened in the in the
 
06:46:23.590 --> 06:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
in the physician's office because
 
06:46:26.670 --> 06:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to the get form oops to
 
06:46:28.990 --> 06:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
get the form anyways and so I'm
 
06:46:30.788 --> 06:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
wondering if there'd be an appetite for
 
06:46:34.310 --> 06:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
an amendment and um um you know for
 
06:46:36.150 --> 06:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
considering because a sort of like if
 
06:46:39.430 --> 06:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
you map process process wise they have
 
06:46:41.070 --> 06:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
to go to the doctors anyways and the
 
06:46:42.948 --> 06:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
doctor could just order it and the
 
06:46:44.430 --> 06:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
doctor's office could provide the
 
06:46:46.430 --> 06:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
handout and so I I appreciate the need
 
06:46:48.468 --> 06:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
to have another a stop Gap because of
 
06:46:50.388 --> 06:46:50.398 align:start position:0%
the numbers of kids who aren't getting
 
06:46:52.548 --> 06:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
tested if the form is required for
 
06:46:54.830 --> 06:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
entrance anyways then that seems like
 
06:46:57.548 --> 06:46:57.558 align:start position:0%
that would be a better
 
06:47:01.310 --> 06:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
place thank you u i saw another
 
06:47:02.670 --> 06:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
representative Nel the juy had up a
 
06:47:05.868 --> 06:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
moment to go yes yeah I think I'm going
 
06:47:07.868 --> 06:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
answer both of those or I mean from a
 
06:47:09.430 --> 06:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
public health point of view the more
 
06:47:13.110 --> 06:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
points of Entry that you use the more
 
06:47:15.310 --> 06:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
likely you are to get the important data
 
06:47:17.830 --> 06:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
that you need I mean my kids went to Boy
 
06:47:19.830 --> 06:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
Scout camp and the forms I had to fill
 
06:47:21.548 --> 06:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
out you know you had to check all this
 
06:47:23.670 --> 06:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
stuff off it wasn't that big a deal and
 
06:47:25.310 --> 06:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
then if something was missing you found
 
06:47:26.510 --> 06:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
out it was missing and then you
 
06:47:29.590 --> 06:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
remediated it wasn't that big a deal and
 
06:47:31.708 --> 06:47:31.718 align:start position:0%
you know i' say yeah the doctor's office
 
06:47:33.510 --> 06:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
this place I I don't have a problem with
 
06:47:36.030 --> 06:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
doing it in more than one place um and
 
06:47:38.150 --> 06:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
that that's how we pre avoid making
 
06:47:39.868 --> 06:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
mistakes we do it in the operating room
 
06:47:41.948 --> 06:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
all the time the more people that ask
 
06:47:43.670 --> 06:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
the question the less likely mistake is
 
06:47:48.830 --> 06:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to happen H oh I do
 
06:47:51.150 --> 06:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I guess it's I'm glad you're to hear
 
06:47:54.110 --> 06:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
you're R well you're not retired yet I'm
 
06:47:58.150 --> 06:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
still good thing I don't that's very
 
06:48:00.750 --> 06:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's very reassuring to hear that
 
06:48:03.270 --> 06:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
especially when you're not a patient
 
06:48:05.310 --> 06:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the motion
 
06:48:05.320 --> 06:48:07.350 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the motion
representative

06:48:07.350 --> 06:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:48:11.548 --> 06:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
lontine uh yeah I feel that um if
 
06:48:13.230 --> 06:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to the doctor's office
 
06:48:15.230 --> 06:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
they're getting the physical exam and
 
06:48:16.948 --> 06:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
that is already being brought to this
 
06:48:18.788 --> 06:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
the school so it's just adding it on
 
06:48:21.708 --> 06:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
that um but I think it's one more step
 
06:48:24.150 --> 06:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
that if they show up at school and they
 
06:48:26.910 --> 06:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
haven't they don't they happen to miss
 
06:48:28.788 --> 06:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
their two-year well child and never got
 
06:48:30.590 --> 06:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
tested for lead it's a way of checking
 
06:48:32.948 --> 06:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
for that I don't think it's overly
 
06:48:36.030 --> 06:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
burdensome just another form to make
 
06:48:37.990 --> 06:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
sure but it could capture a lot more
 
06:48:41.830 --> 06:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
children who have high Leeds that and
 
06:48:44.468 --> 06:48:44.478 align:start position:0%
there's nothing being done about
 
06:48:47.110 --> 06:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
it representative Nel sorry one more
 
06:48:49.468 --> 06:48:49.478 align:start position:0%
comment but if you're catching this at
 
06:48:52.468 --> 06:48:52.478 align:start position:0%
six you're too late so that's the value
 
06:48:54.708 --> 06:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
of of child care because you're catching
 
06:48:57.230 --> 06:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
them at younger ages I mean six is way
 
06:48:58.830 --> 06:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
too late you need to know this way
 
06:49:02.468 --> 06:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
before then so representative Woods uh
 
06:49:06.590 --> 06:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
just to disagree with my uh colleague um
 
06:49:09.708 --> 06:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
it's never too late because uh if you're
 
06:49:12.590 --> 06:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
having a low level of contamination it's
 
06:49:15.310 --> 06:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
cumul the point is it's cumulative it
 
06:49:18.110 --> 06:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't just stop at a certain level so
 
06:49:21.030 --> 06:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
if you're getting a high exposure at age
 
06:49:24.190 --> 06:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
one that may be the end of the story
 
06:49:26.350 --> 06:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
right there but if you've got a very low
 
06:49:28.910 --> 06:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
level you have a chance to intervene and
 
06:49:31.388 --> 06:49:31.398 align:start position:0%
if by age six you pick it up and it is
 
06:49:33.548 --> 06:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
at a low level then you still have a
 
06:49:38.150 --> 06:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
chance to intervene so I just offer

06:53:09.388 --> 06:53:09.398 align:start position:0%
sure do we have a majority with you
 
06:53:11.548 --> 06:53:11.558 align:start position:0%
don't have a what you have is you have a
 
06:53:14.590 --> 06:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
statement in favor of ought to pass and
 
06:53:17.110 --> 06:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
a statement in favor of itl so it isn't
 
06:53:19.468 --> 06:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
a minority or a majority most but I
 
06:53:21.750 --> 06:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
