attendance and higher academic
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
performance than those who are
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
hungry all of the research on this issue
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
supports those conclusions the committee
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
heard comments during the hearing on
 
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
this bill that if students came to
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
school hungry is the fault of the
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
parents this perspective does not
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
reflect the reality of some students
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
lives some of whom are homeless others
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
who are living in Dysfunctional Family
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
situations and it is not fair to blame
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
the actions or in this case the
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
inactions of parents on their
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
children feeding our children should be
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
one of the highest priorities of our
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
schools in this case the 30 school
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
districts that do not currently provide
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
breakfast to their students and finally
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's a sad commentary on our priorities
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
when we need legislation in order to
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
feed children but that's where we are

report thank you Mr Speaker in the
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
education hearings we learned that of
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
466 schools taking advantage of the

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
this measure were to pass schools would
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
need to expand offerings to comply with
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this bill likely
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
increasing costs at an amount
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
indeterminable some of the costs to the
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
Department of education are start up to
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh cost to start up the program and
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
Personnel to oversee and run the program
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
these functions are currently not funded
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
and as a result would violate the New
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution Article 28a as an
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate with only 30 schools in
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not participating in the
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
program it would seem to be a matter of
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
choice over costs for these reasons I
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%

that they provide both breakfast and
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
apply only to the 30 districts that do
 
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
not currently provide
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
if I know that the pro prohibition
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
against teaching discrimination in
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
public workspaces is about censoring
 
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:33.559 align:start position:0%
public employers and programs from
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
sharing historical information that
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
questions the status
 
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:40.799 align:start position:0%
quo and if I know that our country was
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
founded on the principle that speaking
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
without fear of reprisal is essential
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
and guaranteed and if I believe that we
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to defend the
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%

lad for parliamentary inquiry thank you
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that discrimination
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
of any kind is unacceptable in public
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
workplaces and education and if I also
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
know the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
Education has launched launched a new
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
web page in support a New Hampshire
 
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
Commission of Human Rights aimed to
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
ensure that students and educators are
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
free from discrimination and that they
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to learn and teach
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
in a safe environment and lastly if I
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
believe this new law provides a unique
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the department and all
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
school districts to have a meaningful
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
conversations about discrimination and
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
to better understand and differentiate
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
between discrimination and
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination would I then support
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%

that kids don't take this survey

take it
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
seriously how many kids have we helped

the results are reliable and not

01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
bullying there are tough issues
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
addressed in the youth risk behavior
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
survey without a doubt because these are
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
the real issues that are challenging our
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
kids we heard testimony from experts in
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
the field that when participation moves
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
from opt out to optin data and
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
requirements are affected and programs
 
01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.229 align:start position:0%
requirements are affected and programs
are

01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
eliminated questions remain if not the
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
tried andrue yrbs how will we go about
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
Gathering the data to know what we
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
should be doing do we guess are we going
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
to be required to shift the expenses for
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
current programs onto our
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
constituents what kind of messages are
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
we delivering to our youth when we
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
silence their voices because the topics
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
are too tough to talk
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
about for these reasons I ask that you
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
press the red button against the ought
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
to pass pass as amended recommendation
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker some years ago I introduced a
 
01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
bill to put a rain in on non-academic
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
surveys parents had to be notified and
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
questions provided Bill finally passed
 
01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
and is now law even though there have
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
been multiple tries to change it
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
everything was opt out except for the
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
Youth risk behavior
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
survey however at this survey is taken
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
as a joke by most high school students
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
when I was on the school board this was
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
given in our high school I heard from
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
students that they were taking this as a
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
class project to see how bad they can
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
make it how many times do we get
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
drunk do you take drugs and then and
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
they asked answered on how to do it some
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
Weeks Later our principal came to our
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
high school our school board meeting
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
with the disasterous results I then
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
informed them how the survey was taken
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
our student School Board member verified
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
this other schools have the same issues
 
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
when they know the survey is being taken
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
social media goes rampant but entries on
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
how to answer the questions we had
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
testimony with this testimony at our
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
hearing also parents need to know what
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
their children are being asked parental
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
rights all questions on any survey must
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
be given to parents so they can make the
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
decision to allow their children to take
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
the survey
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
over the years we've heard arguments
 
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
that parents do not get the permission
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
slip for the survey so they do not opt
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
in interesting parents have to opt in
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
for field trips these seem to be
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
returned parents don't opt in because
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
they do not want the child to take it
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
and nowadays this is also being done
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
electronically emails Etc to parents so
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
it's not hidden in the school bag some
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
now some may testify that this survey
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
and others are all academic it is a
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
schools responsibility to teach not be
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
social workers these only these surveys
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
only interfere with the student learning
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
activities for example in the CTE
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee that I'm on it came out that
 
01:14:38.189 --> 01:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
some Career Tech education students may
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
miss their courses because the surveys
 
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
be taken at their resident school and
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
it's been proven time after time that no
 
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
survey is anonymous the first seven
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
questions on this survey one can easily
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
determine who is answering the question
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
questions age grade grade sex race
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
height weight Etc then there are
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
questions on using drugs anyone guess
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
who will answer correctly if they
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
are and questions on drugs drinking sex
 
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
suicide can also serve as training AIDS
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen this in the past with some
 
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
drug programs and why they have been
 
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
stopped parents need to know again what
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
questions are being asked for their
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
children If the parents are specifically
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
has to opt in then they will take the
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to check the questions and
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
at what percentage Point does it make
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
the Ser the survey immaterial if only
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
some are answering correctly remember
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
this survey is done by the CDC and
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
depending on what administration is in
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
power questions do become political in
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
the past there are questions on guns in
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
home now I bet this year there'll be
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
question of vaccinations another
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
argument is that they need the entire
 
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
school to take the Serv survey to get
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
the full results what's the do
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
if I know that I have no idea how to
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
counter the amount of misinformation you
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
and if I know that numerous stakeholders
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
testified that they relied on the data
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
collected by the youth Behavior survey
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
to plan programs and services to address
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
bullying suicide anxiety substance abuse
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
and more and if I know that surveys and
 
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
tests have built in metrics to account
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
for the very small number of students
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
that may not take it seriously and if I
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
know that I was in a school when
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
students were taking this risk survey
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't know of very many at all
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
that said oh I'm just going to make a
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
joke out of this and if I know that
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
after spending 36 years in education
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
that optin does not work even for a
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
great field trip because kids are
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
forgetful and if I know that I spent
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
hours in the morning before a field trip
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%

and for future speeches I'm going to ask
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
that all the members adhere to what we
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
try and observe in this chamber that we
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
do not try and put blame or suggest that
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
somebody else has a bad motive or of
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature so please please

difference between maligning and
 
01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:31.590 align:start position:0%
difference between maligning and
questioning

01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%

01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
facts the member in my opinion suggested
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
that the member
 
01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.310 align:start position:0%
that the member
lied

01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
lied
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
now I that I why I'm addressing ing both
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
here we've had it before we've had it
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday and it's already started today
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking all the members to
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
refrain from making any type of an
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr Speaker and I I

appreciate the explanation and agree
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
with it entirely my concern is that
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between the word
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
misinformation which simply means a
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
mistake and disinformation which implies
 
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
a lie thank
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%

Alicia leak is for a parliamentary
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry uh before you start
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%

01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we keep our parliamentary inquiries
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
to parliamentary
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
inquiries they're starting to get a
 
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
little bit long I'm not referring to you
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
right now representative but they're
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
starting to get a little bit long on
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
both sides of the
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
aisle so please keep your parliamentary
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
inquiries to what they should be a true
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry not a
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
speech thank you Mr Speaker if if I know
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
that false information can lead to false
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
results and we're based in um and then
 
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
we would be basing actions on false
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
results and if I know that uh many
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
parents object to this survey and if I
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
know that some that most School District
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
websites are so large and so complicated
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
then even if notification is given on
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
the website the parents May well not
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%

country the house will be in order and
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
yet this body has never had a chance to
 
01:57:34.270 --> 01:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
listen to a debate and vote on the
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bill which established
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
it hb20 the house version of the program
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
raised so many concerns it was retained
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
in committee for further work but the
 
01:57:50.589 --> 01:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
Senate rushed ahead and any way and
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
included their similarly flawed version
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
of in
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
hb2 we have been told that bills
 
01:58:02.109 --> 01:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
attempting to fix this Myriad of ills
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
and we've heard many of them today this
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
week are a cruel attempt at Death By A
 
01:58:09.079 --> 01:58:10.350 align:start position:0%

Thousand
 
01:58:14.069 --> 01:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
Cuts and that those proposing such bills
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
were members of the education
 
01:58:20.189 --> 01:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
establishment cared nothing for the poor
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
or the harm done for
 
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
children despite the fact that most of
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
us have spent our entire working career
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's 40 years for
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
me our working lives loving and
 
01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:37.790 align:start position:0%
me our working lives loving and
teaching

01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
them so this is what we
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
have a program that is wildly unpopular
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
with the general
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
public a program that lacks
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
accountability administered by an outof
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
State company which gets to decide who
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
is approved who gets funded and what
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
qualifies as an educational expense with
 
01:59:07.229 --> 01:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
lax rules passed over the objections of
 
01:59:09.870 --> 01:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
the professionals responsible for
 
01:59:12.510 --> 01:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
advising us on rule
 
01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
making a program that allows
 
01:59:18.069 --> 01:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
organizations receiving public funds to
 
01:59:20.069 --> 01:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
discriminate against against those they
 
01:59:23.229 --> 01:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
don't approve of a program that may
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
leave students and taxpayers susceptible
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
to Fraud and
 
01:59:31.109 --> 01:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
Abuse a program that could bleed the
 
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
state dry financially because there are
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
no budget caps no limits on how much can
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
be spent in just the first few months
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's already nearly $9 million over
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
budget and
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
growing the LBA has warned us us that if
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
all eligible students not currently
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
enrolled in public schools not enrolled
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
in public
 
02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:00.679 align:start position:0%
schools took advantage of the program
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
the cost to the state could be $70
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
million a year I'm going to say that
 
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
again these are for all the kids out
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
there that are eligible for this program
 
02:00:14.669 --> 02:00:14.679 align:start position:0%
now if they all applied next year that's
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
the figure LBA is
 
02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
estimating to and this is new spending
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
this isn't money we're spending on
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
education now talk about a Thousand Cuts
 
02:00:26.669 --> 02:00:26.679 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
hemorrhage we have tried to fix it
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
you've heard us try to fix
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
it the only option available now is to
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
repeal it please let common sense and
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
your sense of frugality Prevail and vote
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
no on this itl motion thank
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:50.350 align:start position:0%
no on this itl motion thank
you

02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative luno has requested a roll
 
02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
call we're coming down to the final
 
02:00:57.069 --> 02:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
speaker is that sufficiently seconded is
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this is going to
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
be a roll call vote we're down to the
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
final speaker so members take their
 
02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:10.750 --> 02:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker the voucher plan is nothing less
 
02:01:16.069 --> 02:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
than an attempt to dismantle our public
 
02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
schools and replace them with private
 
02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:20.149 align:start position:0%
schools and replace them with private
schools

02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
we've heard that argument about the new
 
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program but we
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
first heard it back in
 
02:01:30.069 --> 02:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
2011 with the debate about the tax
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship program the same old
 
02:01:35.709 --> 02:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
proven false
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
argument and since we're on the topic of
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
Education we don't have a voucher plan
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
the states mentioned uh all have voucher
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
plans opponents can't get that right
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we need a lunch and learn program
 
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
about uh education
 
02:01:55.870 --> 02:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
freedom and why are why are opponents so
 
02:01:59.310 --> 02:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
scared of the education Freedom programs
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
I REM am reminded of a quote competition
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
is always a good thing it forces us to
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
do our best a monopoly renders people
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
complacent and satisfied with
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
mediocrity in a 2019 analysis of studies
 
02:02:20.669 --> 02:02:20.679 align:start position:0%
of the impact on Act academics of choice
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
programs on public schools 24 studies
 
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
showed a positive effect of school
 
02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
choice on the public schools one neutral
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
and one negative so why are people
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
scared over 1,800 students are enrolled
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
in the program and remember these are
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
lowincome students due to a family
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
income cap of 300% of federal
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
poverty but HB
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
1683 would repeal and throw those kids
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
out of the program what about them are
 
02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
they just collateral damage yet
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
opponents say shut it
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
down when we're talking about funding
 
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
point out this is the only program of
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
its kind that has a phase out of funding
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
for students leaving a public school the
 
02:03:16.109 --> 02:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
first year after they leave the school
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
gets 100% of State funding plus all
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
local funding the second year they get
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
50% of State funding and all local
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
funding and the third year they get
 
02:03:33.629 --> 02:03:33.639 align:start position:0%
25% of State funding and local funding
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
the year after that they get all local
 
02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:38.390 align:start position:0%
the year after that they get all local
funding

02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
still The Minority Report says that it
 
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
is the responsible thing to do to repeal
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
this program
 
02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
responsible ask par parents how
 
02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
responsible it
 
02:03:55.390 --> 02:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
is yes again opponents are scared scared
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
because this program is successful yes
 
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
more students selected efas than
 
02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:03.149 align:start position:0%
more students selected efas than
originally

02:04:03.149 --> 02:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
estimated and why is that why is it
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
above en rollan estimates well the
 
02:04:11.470 --> 02:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic opened a window into education
 
02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
and the parents have taken notice a
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
parents are standing up against those
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
who say they should not have a role in
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
their children's educ ation parents are
 
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
standing up for Education options
 
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
parents are standing up and so should we
 
02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
and we will we will stand up for
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
families and children we will stand up
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
for Education opportunities for New

Hampshire children we will stand against
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
this repeal we will out itl this
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
outrageous attempt to destroy this
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
program if children are our future we
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
must must provide them with educational
 
02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities to be successful we will
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
not fail these students and we will not
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%

02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
if I know New Hampshire's 160,000 public
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
school kids perform among the best in
 
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
the country and that's what parents want
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
and if I know the state's voucher
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
program is the most expansive voucher
 
02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
program in the country and is riddled
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
with flaws and if I know that the
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
program is clearly not as successful as
 
02:06:25.149 --> 02:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
some proponents may suggest given that
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the voucher
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
students maybe around 200 um I'm sorry
 
02:06:34.990 --> 02:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
vast majority of of students maybe maybe
 
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
around 1,600 were already attending
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
private schools and homeschooling
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
situations and if I know that this bill
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
is the only option left since every
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
other Bill to improve the financial
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility accountability and to
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
prevent fraud has been defeated and if I
 
02:06:58.549 --> 02:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
know this bill will repeal a program
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
that steals from taxpayers and is ripe
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
for fraud and misuse then would I press
 
02:07:06.030 --> 02:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
the red button to overturn the itail
 
02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:10.520 align:start position:0%

that every child is entitled to an
 
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:26.800 align:start position:0%

02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
one-size fits-all program system cannot
 
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
possibly provide it to every child and I
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
know that this legislation before us
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
would tear almost 2,000 children away
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
from their chosen environment and return
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%

Amendment

02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
02:19:56.469 --> 02:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues I rise today to
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
oppose the committee Amendment on cacr
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
15 the underlying cacr as titled as the
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
title would suggest would allow for
 
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
17-year-olds to vote in the primary
 
02:20:08.670 --> 02:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
elections if they are 18 by the general
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
election I oppose this amendment for
 
02:20:14.110 --> 02:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons first it completely
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
guts and replaces the bill secondly I
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
believe that the underlying bill would
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually pass with B with a bipartisan
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
majority as the underlying bill was
 
02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:24.550 align:start position:0%
majority as the underlying bill was
actually

02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire leg legislative youth

advisory Council while the amendment is
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
opposed by the council that is why I ask
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
all of you to vote down this amendment
 
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:55.840 align:start position:0%

02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
the underlying Constitutional Amendment
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%

thank

02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%

02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker and thank you to the
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing the issue
 
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
before the body because it is always um
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
great to learn something new about
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
proces in the house because once a bill
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
goes to a committee it is the Committees
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
and we know that in all of our
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
committees that we as committee members
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
then control what goes forward in a
 
02:21:41.469 --> 02:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
bill whether it is related to the
 
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
original subject or not after a hearing
 
02:21:48.510 --> 02:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
on what amendments might be non-g
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
and that is indeed as you just heard
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
what happened in this
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
amendment this representative from
 
02:21:59.630 --> 02:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
gtown didn't think that the underlying
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
Bill had much chance of success before
 
02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:02.510 align:start position:0%
Bill had much chance of success before
the

02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:05.710 --> 02:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
house and this representative from
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
gtown often disagrees with other
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
representatives from gtown and that is
 
02:22:15.150 --> 02:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
the point of this debate of this Hall of
 
02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:16.150 align:start position:0%
the point of this debate of this Hall of
this

02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:18.190 align:start position:0%
this
microphone

02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that's brought before
 
02:22:23.070 --> 02:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
you is to raise an issue for your
 
02:22:26.510 --> 02:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
consideration indeed about elections
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
about voting and who should be voting in
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
them I actually disagreed that it was
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
non- gerain but we followed the process
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
and that is the bill that is before you
 
02:22:40.990 --> 02:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
today and I ask that you support the
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
amendment so that we can have a debate
 
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
on the underlying issue that is Before
 
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:48.600 align:start position:0%

report is it on thank you Mr Speaker the
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
majority stated purpose in the committee
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
of this C this amendment as amended the
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
cacr is to place the current statutory
 
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
definitions of Resident residency and
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
domicile into the Constitution so that
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
it will be harder to change them in the
 
02:26:31.230 --> 02:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
future the minority feels that this cacr
 
02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:32.910 align:start position:0%
future the minority feels that this cacr
is

02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
unnecessary precisely because these
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
definitions are already in the
 
02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
statutes but more importantly if we are
 
02:26:44.830 --> 02:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
going to amend and put these definitions
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
into the Constitution then let's do it
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
right the language should be drafted
 
02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and carefully so as not to
 
02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
create more confusion about an issue
 
02:26:58.750 --> 02:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
that this body has argued about for
 
02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
years and in court if ped there will be
 
02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
five qualifications to vote in New
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you must be a citizen of the
 
02:27:12.349 --> 02:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
United States you must be a citizen of
 
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you must be domiciled in
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New Hampshire must be your
 
02:27:22.269 --> 02:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
primary residency and you can only vote
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
where you are
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
domiciled so let's look at the second
 
02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
and the fourth requirements both of
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%

residency or citizen of New Hampshire
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
defined not in the

cacr and not in the statutes the term
 
02:27:49.309 --> 02:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
primary residency implies that there
 
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
might be a secondary residency or other
 
02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
types of
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
residency and what does it mean to be a
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
citizen of New Hampshire how is it
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
different from being a citizen of the

inquired this cacr creates creates
 
02:28:19.710 --> 02:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
necessary confusion and will actually
 
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
prolong the debate over the definitions
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
of domicile and
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
residency and if passed in its current
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
form no not only will be it more
 
02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to amend the bill but it will
 
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
insert even more uncertainty into the
 
02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
already protracted debate regarding what
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%

cacr so it requires
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
2/3 uh Mr Speaker the election law
 
02:29:18.550 --> 02:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
committee is attempting to put to bed
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
the endless debate in New Hampshire over
 
02:29:23.790 --> 02:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
who should vote in a New Hampshire
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
election the old domicile residency
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
state of mind we're trying to put that
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
to bed Mr Speaker we are saying that if
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is your primary residency
 
02:29:42.510 --> 02:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
you get to vote here we asked people
 
02:29:44.349 --> 02:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
testifying about this bill how many
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
people do you think this will stop from
 
02:29:48.269 --> 02:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire election they
 
02:29:51.790 --> 02:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
said well realistically none why because
 
02:29:54.030 --> 02:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
you should already be a resident if you
 
02:29:56.349 --> 02:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
are voting here voting is an active
 
02:30:00.190 --> 02:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
residency so Mr Speaker this is a common
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
sense reform and the question before us
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
is who should vote in a New Hampshire
 
02:30:10.590 --> 02:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
election residents of New Hampshire or
 
02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
residents and non-residents of New
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so Mr Speaker if you believe
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
that non- residents should be voting in
 
02:30:21.950 --> 02:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elections oppose this Mr
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker if you believe that only
 
02:30:26.190 --> 02:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire should be
 
02:30:28.349 --> 02:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire then you should
 
02:30:28.359 --> 02:30:32.030 align:start position:0%

vote

02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
green the motion before us is the ought
 
02:30:38.910 --> 02:30:38.920 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker yeah if I
 
02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
knew that cacr 15 should be would not
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
resolve ambiguities uh could the
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%

minute good to go thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:31:21.550 --> 02:31:21.560 align:start position:0%

02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
ambiguities but would actually introduce
 
02:31:24.399 --> 02:31:25.309 align:start position:0%
ambiguities but would actually introduce
new

02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:31:27.550 --> 02:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
ambiguities into the venerable New
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitution of
 
02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
1783 and if I believed that cacr 15
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
might impede ballot access for voters
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%

knew that current law already does what
 
02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
this cacr proposes to
 
02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
do which is to require that New

Hampshire elections be conducted using
 
02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:36.349 align:start position:0%

law in this respect be changed in any
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
way and if I believed that this cacr in
 
02:37:58.429 --> 02:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
practice would function to validate
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
unfounded fears that New Hampshire
 
02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
elections lack
 
02:38:06.790 --> 02:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
Integrity rather than functioning to
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
solve real problems would I press the

report thank you Mr
 
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker House Bill 1009 would require
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
that the date of person registers to
 
02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
vote be included with other V vo
 
02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
information in election net that's being
 
02:42:22.309 --> 02:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
done now and it's been done since 2006
 
02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
when the state launched the Statewide
 
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
voter registration database which was
 
02:42:27.790 --> 02:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
required under the federal help America
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
vote act there's a field titled date of
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
voter information which is the date of
 
02:42:33.359 --> 02:42:34.790 align:start position:0%
voter information which is the date of
voter

02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
voter
 
02:42:36.670 --> 02:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
registration right now the date of
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
registration is confidential if the bill
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
passes the date of registration will
 
02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
still be
 
02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
confidential the data fields that are
 
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
printed on a checklist under state law
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
now are name domicile mailing address if
 
02:42:53.230 --> 02:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
different from domicile and party
 
02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
affiliation the bill does not require
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
that the date of registration be printed
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
on the checklist so what will this bill
 
02:43:03.150 --> 02:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
do and here's the problem prior to the
 
02:43:05.950 --> 02:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
launch of election net towns and cities
 
02:43:08.429 --> 02:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
maintain their own voter registration
 
02:43:10.830 --> 02:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
databases whose primary purpose was to
 
02:43:12.269 --> 02:43:12.279 align:start position:0%
generate the checklists that would be
 
02:43:15.469 --> 02:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
used at the polls since the date voters
 
02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
registered to vote wasn't needed to
 
02:43:19.950 --> 02:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
print the checklist that information
 
02:43:21.910 --> 02:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't contained in the
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
database so the bill creates an unfunded
 
02:43:26.349 --> 02:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
mandate there's no Grandfather Clause
 
02:43:29.429 --> 02:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
here in 2006 our towns and cities
 
02:43:31.309 --> 02:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
migrated approximately
 
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
825,000 voter records into election net
 
02:43:37.309 --> 02:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
most did not include the voter's
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
registration date since there's no
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
Grandfather Clause the bill will require
 
02:43:44.910 --> 02:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
that communities scour their databases
 
02:43:47.630 --> 02:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
ident identify the pre2 2006 voter
 
02:43:49.630 --> 02:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
records in election that do not have a
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
date of voter registration pull the
 
02:43:54.429 --> 02:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
paper record and then key in the updated
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
voter registration
 
02:43:58.670 --> 02:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
information article 28a of the
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution prohibits the state from
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
mandating any new expanded or modified
 
02:44:06.110 --> 02:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
programs or responsibilities to any
 
02:44:08.510 --> 02:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivision in such a way as
 
02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
to necessitate additional local
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures house bill9 would require
 
02:44:16.510 --> 02:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
that election officials bear the cost of
 
02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
keying in data for the pre2 2006 records
 
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
without providing a means to reimburse
 
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
the communities for their costs in doing
 
02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
so please press the no red button to
 
02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
overturn the committee recommendation so
 
02:44:31.950 --> 02:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
that another motion can be made and Mr
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%

02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
summarizes quite well the point that I'm
 
02:51:34.670 --> 02:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
trying to make uh standing here at the
 
02:51:37.830 --> 02:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
podium today it refers to House Bill
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
1082 and it says this bill limits
 
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
political speech by prohibiting
 
02:51:43.469 --> 02:51:43.479 align:start position:0%

the security of freedom in a state they

ought therefore to be inv viably
 
02:52:09.389 --> 02:52:09.399 align:start position:0%
preserved end quote and it finals it
 
02:52:11.110 --> 02:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
ends with its position limits on all
 
02:52:13.190 --> 02:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
speech in particularly political speech
 
02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
may be a tempting solution to a
 
02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
perceived problem but it is not a proper
 
02:52:20.950 --> 02:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
solution during the public hearing on
 
02:52:23.429 --> 02:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
this bill and in the majority
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
report the sponsor cited the quote
 
02:52:28.190 --> 02:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nature of these two offices
 
02:52:29.790 --> 02:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
as just as
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
justification for these fundraising
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions I don't think I need to
 
02:52:35.870 --> 02:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
remind you that all our town and City
 
02:52:39.070 --> 02:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
elections are nonpartisan in nature too
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
um I hate to open the door to think that
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to have packs in our
 
02:52:44.710 --> 02:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
names if we were running for for
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
election or
 
02:52:48.389 --> 02:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
reelection finally this bill would have
 
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
a severe impact on the ability of
 
02:52:52.110 --> 02:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
candidates for Secretary of State and
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
State treasur to gather the financial
 
02:52:56.309 --> 02:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
resources needed to effectively
 
02:52:57.870 --> 02:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
communicate with those who will cast
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
votes in those elections and would POS
 
02:53:03.269 --> 02:53:03.279 align:start position:0%

02:53:53.309 --> 02:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
includes candidate committees in
 
02:53:57.030 --> 02:53:57.040 align:start position:0%

02:54:07.870 --> 02:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
on my limited knowledge of campaign
 
02:54:10.910 --> 02:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
Finance laws I consider a pack and a
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
candidate committee the same thing in
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
terms of filing reports with the
 
02:54:17.150 --> 02:54:17.160 align:start position:0%

report thank you Mr
 
02:54:36.110 --> 02:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker this legislature and its wisdom
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
made the office of Secretary of State
 
02:54:40.510 --> 02:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
and State Treasurer nonpartisan in
 
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
1997 when it amended rsa1 14 col 2-
 
02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
B while I didn't have the honor of being
 
02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
a member of this body back then I I
 
02:54:52.630 --> 02:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
understand that at least part of the
 
02:54:55.469 --> 02:54:55.479 align:start position:0%
reason for having done so was because
 
02:54:57.870 --> 02:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
these offices are not partisan in nature
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
and really should not be political in
 
02:55:02.510 --> 02:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
nature the political aspect of New
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections is handled by our
 
02:55:06.790 --> 02:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
two great political parties and should
 
02:55:08.750 --> 02:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
not in any way be found in the
 
02:55:12.269 --> 02:55:12.279 align:start position:0%
Department of State along that same line
 
02:55:14.309 --> 02:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
the administration of State finances
 
02:55:16.510 --> 02:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
should not be a political matter but a
 
02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
sensible professional and
 
02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:20.349 align:start position:0%
sensible professional and
straightforward

02:55:20.349 --> 02:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
02:55:22.870 --> 02:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
one I understand the contention that
 
02:55:25.389 --> 02:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
municipal candidates all over the state
 
02:55:28.510 --> 02:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
are also nonpartisan and can and would
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
still be able to form packs even if this
 
02:55:33.750 --> 02:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill were passed however they are
 
02:55:36.309 --> 02:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
seeking the votes of thousands of people
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
and are popularly elected while we may
 
02:55:42.630 --> 02:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
call our decisions on Secretary of State
 
02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
and State treasur and elect ction what
 
02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
they really uh amount to are
 
02:55:50.110 --> 02:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
appointments by a government body
 
02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
candidates for these constitutional
 
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
officers are seeking the support of only
 
02:55:57.830 --> 02:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
a few hundred New Hampshire is one of
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
three states in which these officials
 
02:56:02.550 --> 02:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
are elected by the state legislature and
 
02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
not by the general electorate in Maine
 
02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
one of the other two states forming
 
02:56:10.190 --> 02:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
packs is prohibited by those who would
 
02:56:12.910 --> 02:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
seek and serve in these Offices in
 
02:56:16.070 --> 02:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
Tennessee the third state the concept is
 
02:56:18.229 --> 02:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
viewed as so inappropriate that no one
 
02:56:21.229 --> 02:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
does it on an occasion in recent years
 
02:56:22.910 --> 02:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
when such a pack was formed in New
 
02:56:26.349 --> 02:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it was similarly received with
 
02:56:28.950 --> 02:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
disapproval the best example of the need
 
02:56:30.830 --> 02:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
to maintain the integrity and
 
02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
non-political nonpartisan nature of the
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office in
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
particular is the legacy of former
 
02:56:40.349 --> 02:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
secretary William Gardner secretary
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%

state well for four and a half decades
 
02:56:48.349 --> 02:56:48.359 align:start position:0%

02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%

legislature he was so elected and
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%

to form political action committees
 
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
would dangerously and unnecessarily
 
02:57:13.550 --> 02:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
inject politics and possible conflicts
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
of interest into these important offices
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%

657 col 12 relative to absentee voting
 
04:22:40.030 --> 04:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
the statute currently states that quote
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
upon receipt of a properly executed
 
04:22:45.550 --> 04:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
application for an absentee ballot a
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
town or clerk shall ascertain if the
 
04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
applicant is on the checklist and if so
 
04:22:51.950 --> 04:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
the clerk shall send the materials end
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
quote this bill proposes adding the
 
04:22:56.670 --> 04:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
following sentence to that statute quote
 
04:22:58.830 --> 04:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
under no circumstances shall a town or

the town of clerk has approved the
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
application end quote in short the bill
 
04:23:13.389 --> 04:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
says the same thing that the statute
 
04:23:13.399 --> 04:23:14.790 align:start position:0%
says the same thing that the statute
already

04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
says no substance is being added to the
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
statute that isn't already there among
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
the principles of good legal writing
 
04:23:24.030 --> 04:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary or extra word should be
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
removed redundancy should be avoided and
 
04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
different words should not be used to
 
04:23:31.870 --> 04:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
say the same thing House Bill 1153 is
 
04:23:33.870 --> 04:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
poorly crafted adds nothing to existing
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
law and is totally
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary please press the red no
 
04:23:39.109 --> 04:23:39.119 align:start position:0%
button to overturn the committee
 
04:23:40.990 --> 04:23:41.000 align:start position:0%

Speaker this legis legislation proposes
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
a change in RSA 657
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
col2 to clarify and reinforce the
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
requirement that absentee ballots may be
 
04:24:18.990 --> 04:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
mailed to absentee voters only after an
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot application has been
 
04:24:22.950 --> 04:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
received and approved by the town or
 
04:24:22.960 --> 04:24:23.870 align:start position:0%
received and approved by the town or
city

04:24:23.870 --> 04:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
city
 
04:24:25.950 --> 04:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
clerk the necessity for this
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
clarification was demonstrated by
 
04:24:30.189 --> 04:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
testimony before the election law
 
04:24:32.429 --> 04:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
committee which revealed that some
 
04:24:35.349 --> 04:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
clerks include the actual absentee
 
04:24:37.710 --> 04:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
ballot when resp responding by mail to
 
04:24:39.870 --> 04:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
request for voter registration forms and
 
04:24:41.790 --> 04:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
applications the result is that some
 
04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
unregistered applicants receive absentee
 
04:24:49.389 --> 04:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
ballots before becoming a registered
 
04:24:52.229 --> 04:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
voter and before their absentee ballot
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
applications have been properly
 
04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
certified members appreciate that as
 
04:24:59.950 --> 04:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
clarified by this legislation clerks
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
will have to perform two mailings one to
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
send the application forms and one to
 
04:25:06.670 --> 04:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
send the absentee ballot however the
 
04:25:08.189 --> 04:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
majority of the election law committee
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
believes that the requirement is
 
04:25:12.870 --> 04:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to ensure that registrations
 
04:25:15.269 --> 04:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
are processed before a registrant is
 
04:25:18.109 --> 04:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
provided in absentee ballot this will
 
04:25:20.030 --> 04:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
enhance election
 
04:25:22.109 --> 04:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
Integrity by preventing official
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots from going to
 
04:25:26.750 --> 04:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
unregistered voters who that may not
 
04:25:28.469 --> 04:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
have the right to vote in New
 
04:25:31.109 --> 04:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I therefore respectfully
 
04:25:33.750 --> 04:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
request that you press the green button

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:26:51.550 --> 04:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
that nothing is being added to the
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
statute that isn't already there and if
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
I know that the absentee voter
 
04:26:57.870 --> 04:26:57.880 align:start position:0%

04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%

speaker appears in a different statute
 
04:27:05.309 --> 04:27:05.319 align:start position:0%
if I know that house bill 1153 is poorly
 
04:27:07.229 --> 04:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
crafted redundant and totally
 
04:27:09.309 --> 04:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessary would I then press the red
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
no button so the subsequent motion may
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%

I now Mr Speaker press the green button
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
so such a practice can no longer take
 
04:27:46.030 --> 04:27:46.040 align:start position:0%

inexpedient to legislate Senor Paul Bon
 
04:29:50.910 --> 04:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
for the minority of the committee the
 
04:29:52.870 --> 04:29:52.880 align:start position:0%

04:29:57.109 --> 04:29:57.119 align:start position:0%

those poose nay yes
 
04:30:09.070 --> 04:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the amendment is
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
adopted the motion before us now is
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amend last minute
 
04:30:15.389 --> 04:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment does not accomplish that the
 
04:30:17.229 --> 04:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
bill retains a two-tiered voter
 
04:30:18.830 --> 04:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
registration system which the court
 
04:30:20.109 --> 04:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
found was
 
04:30:22.349 --> 04:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and it introduces new
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
confusions that will invite new
 
04:30:27.630 --> 04:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
litigation for example a person who
 
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
registers to vote 30 days or less before
 
04:30:32.070 --> 04:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
an election and who doesn't have proof
 
04:30:35.109 --> 04:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
of residency can sign an affidavit if he
 
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that his domicile may be
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
verified a person who registers more
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
than 30 days before an election does not
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
have that option they cannot sign that
 
04:30:47.550 --> 04:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
residency affidavit instead they sign
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
one in which they're swearing that quote
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
they will not ever be able to possess
 
04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
any qualifying documents of domicile end
 
04:30:58.189 --> 04:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
quote if I were homeless I sure wouldn't
 
04:30:59.710 --> 04:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
want to swear under the penalty of fines
 
04:31:02.070 --> 04:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
that I would be forever homeless but
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
here's another example and this is a
 
04:31:06.030 --> 04:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
true story and it's the kind of
 
04:31:08.189 --> 04:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
situation that often occurs with new new
 
04:31:09.910 --> 04:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
residents to our
 
04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
communities just before I retired as
 
04:31:14.109 --> 04:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
City Clerk in Nashville came a woman
 
04:31:17.550 --> 04:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
came into our office uh she happened to
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh I happened to be the one assisting
 
04:31:22.429 --> 04:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
her at the counter she and uh she had
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
just gotten married a couple of weeks
 
04:31:26.389 --> 04:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
prior she and her husband had come in
 
04:31:28.269 --> 04:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
for the marriage license about a month
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
prior to that previously she lived in
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
tingor her husband lived in nashille he
 
04:31:35.910 --> 04:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
was renting a condo in nashwa so after
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
they were married she moved in with them
 
04:31:40.229 --> 04:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
the lease was in his name all the
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
utilities were in his name and she
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
wanted and needed to get a New Hampshire
 
04:31:45.830 --> 04:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
driver's license because she needed to
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
do that within two months of moving to
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire she brought her marriage
 
04:31:51.790 --> 04:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
certificate along with a copy of her
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
husband's lease and her husband's
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
utility bill because nothing had been
 
04:31:57.790 --> 04:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
changed over yet both of which had her
 
04:31:59.189 --> 04:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
husband's name on them and when she
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
tried to get a driver's license she was
 
04:32:04.429 --> 04:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
refused the person at DMV actually told
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
her that the marriage certificant didn't
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
didn't prove that she lived with her
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
husband at that
 
04:32:11.590 --> 04:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
address so she wanted to register to
 
04:32:13.389 --> 04:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
vote to have proof of where she
 
04:32:16.229 --> 04:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
lived now I knew that they had come in
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
they had got the license I knew her
 
04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
where her husband lived I had no
 
04:32:21.469 --> 04:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
problems whatsoever of registering that
 
04:32:22.510 --> 04:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
person to
 
04:32:25.109 --> 04:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
vote of course I can't do it if this
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't have done it if this bill was
 
04:32:28.990 --> 04:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
in effect because she had no physical
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
evidence of domicile and could not swear
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
that she would quote not ever be able to
 
04:32:36.109 --> 04:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
possess any qualifying documents at
 
04:32:38.429 --> 04:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
domicile she was not would not be
 
04:32:40.269 --> 04:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
eligible to register to vote under this
 
04:32:41.710 --> 04:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
law as it's
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
written another litigation concern the
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
voter registration form for Citizens
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
registering to vote 30 days prior to an
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
election uh states that the applicant
 
04:32:55.469 --> 04:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
has to swear that to make that he has to
 
04:32:57.670 --> 04:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
make the address I have entered above my
 
04:33:00.030 --> 04:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
domicile for voting I must have an
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
intent to make this the one place from
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
which I participate in Democratic
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
self-government and must have acted to
 
04:33:08.670 --> 04:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
carry out that
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
intent I have no idea what must have
 
04:33:13.949 --> 04:33:13.959 align:start position:0%
acted to carry out that intent means the
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
expression is undefined
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
unexplained the minority is concerned
 
04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
that the bill will make ballot access
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
more confusing and difficult for some
 
04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
citizens to register to vote and the
 
04:33:25.629 --> 04:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
courts will end up having to weigh in
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
again because we rush through this
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
amended bill it needs more work please
 
04:33:32.670 --> 04:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
press the red no button to overturn the
 
04:33:34.750 --> 04:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation so that another

report thank you Mr
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker HB 1203 was introduced to remove
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
language from the RSA that is no longer
 
04:33:55.709 --> 04:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
used because of a Supreme Court decision
 
04:33:58.590 --> 04:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
and to restore some necessary language
 
04:34:00.869 --> 04:34:00.879 align:start position:0%
that existed in the RSA prior to that
 
04:34:04.949 --> 04:34:04.959 align:start position:0%
decision however HB 1203 as introduced
 
04:34:07.029 --> 04:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
as in introduced would have weakened the
 
04:34:09.310 --> 04:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
domicile residency requirements for
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire for example 654
 
04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
colon 1 the section that deals with the
 
04:34:17.709 --> 04:34:17.719 align:start position:0%
person's claim of domicile was amended
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
to add a person's claim of domicile for
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
voting purposes shall not be conclusive
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
of the person's residence for any other
 
04:34:29.470 --> 04:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
purpose Amendment
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
962h amends HB 1203 to replace all after
 
04:34:37.470 --> 04:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
the enacting clause as amended HB 1203
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
removes the language regarding voter
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
registration forms and voter affidavits
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
that is no longer used because of the
 
04:34:47.789 --> 04:34:47.799 align:start position:0%
Court decision and it restores some
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
language as I mentioned that existed in
 
04:34:52.709 --> 04:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
the RSA prior to the court
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
decision this language is supported by
 
04:34:59.709 --> 04:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office I also
 
04:35:02.910 --> 04:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
added it this bill also adds language to
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
strengthen and clarify the forms and
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
process processes used for registration
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
prior to 30 days before an election and
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
the forms and processes used for voting
 
04:35:17.390 --> 04:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
within or registering within 30 days of
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
election or on Election Day the intent
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
of this language is to ensure that every
 
04:35:25.910 --> 04:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
qualified New Hampshire voter has a
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
right to register and vote it is also to
 
04:35:32.590 --> 04:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
assure to the best we can that persons
 
04:35:34.590 --> 04:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
who are not qualified to vote in New
 
04:35:36.590 --> 04:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should not be allowed to vote
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and thereby dilute the
 
04:35:41.910 --> 04:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
vote of those who are qualified to vote
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I urge you to support
 
04:35:45.869 --> 04:35:45.879 align:start position:0%
the election law committee's
 
04:35:53.990 --> 04:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%

04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
04:36:54.910 --> 04:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
um before I start the pi have a very
 
04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
quick question was I was under the
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
impression we were going to have a floor
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
fight over the amendment which you're
 
04:37:01.869 --> 04:37:01.879 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a parliamentary
 
04:37:05.629 --> 04:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
inquiry okay so the uh real par in Korea
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
is trying to make us out of order that's
 
04:37:11.590 --> 04:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
fine thank and thank you Mr Speaker if I
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
know that the hb123 as amended is so
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
poorly drafted it's hard to tell exactly
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
what it does even after I've reread it
 
04:37:18.879 --> 04:37:20.189 align:start position:0%
what it does even after I've reread it
several

04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
several
 
04:37:22.830 --> 04:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
times but if I was able to discern that
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment does not protect the
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
right to vote and does not simplify the
 
04:37:28.429 --> 04:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
voter registration process and in
 
04:37:30.029 --> 04:37:30.039 align:start position:0%
general does pretty much the exact
 
04:37:32.349 --> 04:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
opposite of what myself the prime
 
04:37:34.029 --> 04:37:34.039 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and the co-sponsors
 
04:37:34.039 --> 04:37:36.269 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and the co-sponsors
intended

04:37:36.269 --> 04:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
intended
 
04:37:40.109 --> 04:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
and um so find out so would I then
 
04:37:41.789 --> 04:37:41.799 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized for
 
04:37:44.070 --> 04:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry yes I
 
04:37:46.910 --> 04:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
I I thought I was thought I was giving
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
one so if I know that this amendment um
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
does not do with the sponsor is intended
 
04:37:55.830 --> 04:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
would I then press the red button so
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
that an alternative motion can be um can
 
04:38:01.590 --> 04:38:01.600 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
bill has amended makes changes to our
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
election laws that will make them
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the practice is
 
04:38:21.070 --> 04:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
making them easier for persons to
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
understand and if I know that this
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
amendment continues to allow for
 
04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
affidavits of proof of Eligibility to
 
04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%

qualifications 30 days before and
 
04:38:40.470 --> 04:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that this legislation
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
does not create any unreasonable burdens
 
04:38:45.709 --> 04:38:45.719 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:42:26.868 --> 04:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know House Bill
 
04:42:29.788 --> 04:42:29.798 align:start position:0%
1247 would require that in any political
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
subdivision that uses electronic ballot
 
04:42:32.638 --> 04:42:33.550 align:start position:0%
subdivision that uses electronic ballot
counting

04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
counting
 
04:42:33.560 --> 04:42:36.628 align:start position:0%
counting
machines

04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:39.868 --> 04:42:39.878 align:start position:0%
any ballot that has been folded by uh
 
04:42:42.230 --> 04:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
any ballot that has been folded uh be
 
04:42:45.150 --> 04:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
held for counting after the polls close
 
04:42:47.470 --> 04:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
and if I know the Windam audit found
 
04:42:49.948 --> 04:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
that some folded ballots were not read
 
04:42:52.750 --> 04:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
properly by B ballot counting machines
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
due to a shadow uh created by the fold
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
rending the scan are unable to
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
accurately score the
 
04:43:02.190 --> 04:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
results Mr Speaker I further know that
 
04:43:04.110 --> 04:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
we would never have known the rail
 
04:43:06.948 --> 04:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
antenna of those voters if an audit had
 
04:43:08.750 --> 04:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
not been
 
04:43:10.948 --> 04:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
performed if I believe there's reason to
 
04:43:12.910 --> 04:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
think this can happen under other
 
04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
circumstances and if I know towns
 
04:43:16.868 --> 04:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
already hand count ballots when there's
 
04:43:19.310 --> 04:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
a right in candidate on the ballot and
 
04:43:21.150 --> 04:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
that works just
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
fine and finally if I know that this
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
legislation would add an additional
 
04:43:29.470 --> 04:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
measure of security by requiring all
 
04:43:31.948 --> 04:43:31.958 align:start position:0%
folded ballots to be hand
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
counted when I now press the red button
 
04:43:37.470 --> 04:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
to overturn the itel motion to ensure
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
that every vote counts and return
 
04:43:41.550 --> 04:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
confidence to voters that the New
 
04:43:41.560 --> 04:43:42.708 align:start position:0%

04:43:46.510 --> 04:43:46.520 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
that hand counting ballots after the
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
polls close will add another four to
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
five hours to the 14-hour day already
 
04:44:14.190 --> 04:44:14.200 align:start position:0%

04:44:31.390 --> 04:44:31.400 align:start position:0%

04:44:49.270 --> 04:44:49.280 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:52:42.910 --> 04:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the subject of
 
04:52:45.990 --> 04:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
this bill comes without recommendation
 
04:52:49.868 --> 04:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
from the committee ensuring long debates
 
04:52:52.190 --> 04:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
on the issues presented by this
 
04:52:57.470 --> 04:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
bill and if I know that even if past
 
04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would have no impact on
 
04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
upcoming elections in
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
2022 and none on local elections in
 
04:53:09.868 --> 04:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
2023 because of the process that needs
 
04:53:14.310 --> 04:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
to be followed for a community to opt in
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this purports to be
 
04:53:21.788 --> 04:53:21.798 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation but none of the
 
04:53:25.150 --> 04:53:25.160 align:start position:0%

the company's General Treasurer instead
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
this body changed the law so that

corporations have no restrictions on
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
where their campaign cont contributions
 
04:58:06.270 --> 04:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
come come from creating an unfair

campaign limits set for them by using
 
05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
this loophole which has become known as
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
the LLC
 
05:04:24.910 --> 05:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
loopo this bill would close that making
 
05:04:27.868 --> 05:04:27.878 align:start position:0%
the existing contribution limits meaning
 
05:04:30.270 --> 05:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
meaningful because without them they're
 
05:04:32.750 --> 05:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
meaningless without it individuals and
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
corporations can form numerous llc's to
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
get around the
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
Caps this bill is not in violation of
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
anyone's First Amendment rights as some
 
05:04:45.548 --> 05:04:45.558 align:start position:0%
have claimed just as campaign limits for
 
05:04:47.788 --> 05:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
individuals and corporations are not
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
violations of their first amendment
 
05:04:52.830 --> 05:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
rights all this does is close the
 
05:04:55.948 --> 05:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
loophole available now only to
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
llc's this bill is a campaign financing
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill that increases transparency and
 
05:05:05.548 --> 05:05:05.558 align:start position:0%
accountability and the fact that we did
 
05:05:07.910 --> 05:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
campaign financing last year doesn't
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
mean we can continue to clean up
 
05:05:12.990 --> 05:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
campaign financing this year thank you
 
05:05:14.670 --> 05:05:14.680 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker House
 
05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
Bill 1394 is a bill that simply cannot
 
05:05:47.310 --> 05:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
and should not work for New Hampshire
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation would require
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
political contributions made by an LLC
 
05:05:53.948 --> 05:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
to be attributed to the member of the
 
05:05:55.948 --> 05:05:55.958 align:start position:0%
LLC and counted against their
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
contribution limit however we don't
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
track memberships of llc's in the state
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire you could have a one
 
05:06:05.948 --> 05:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
member LLC or a 50 member LLC and no
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
existing state statute or proposed state
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
statute by this legislation would report
 
05:06:13.230 --> 05:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
to the public or to any state agency the
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
membership of that LLC a contribution
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
from an LLC is viewed the same as a
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
contribution from an individual in state
 
05:06:22.990 --> 05:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
law and in court findings and we should
 
05:06:25.470 --> 05:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
not upend that process this body
 
05:06:27.990 --> 05:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
considered nearly identical legislation
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
last year and we found it inexpedient to
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislate then and we should find it
 
05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%

Hampshire is becoming more
 
05:11:11.110 --> 05:11:11.120 align:start position:0%

05:11:13.270 --> 05:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
instructions and ballots may be above
 
05:11:15.190 --> 05:11:15.200 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that hb1
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
1442 FN the federal standard from
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
five lowers the federal standard from 5%
 
05:11:54.430 --> 05:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
to 3% without any rationale or
 
05:11:56.548 --> 05:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
population data to support a stricter
 
05:12:00.510 --> 05:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire standard which even at 3%
 
05:12:03.470 --> 05:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
does not apply anywhere where in the
 
05:12:06.868 --> 05:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
state and Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
requirement especially the third
 
05:12:12.350 --> 05:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
language could be inordinately expensive
 
05:12:15.190 --> 05:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
and in some cases a legally defensible
 
05:12:18.110 --> 05:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
translation may not be possible and
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%

sufficiently to Warrant a multilanguage

municipalities whose election officials

negligently failed to perform their
 
05:16:17.590 --> 05:16:17.600 align:start position:0%

05:16:19.948 --> 05:16:19.958 align:start position:0%
a concept that is not defined in state
 
05:16:22.470 --> 05:16:22.480 align:start position:0%

clarity as to who can file a complaint
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%

election related duties properly to
 
05:16:59.470 --> 05:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
ensure the Integrity of our

05:17:03.868 --> 05:17:03.878 align:start position:0%
recent well-documented New Hampshire
 
05:17:06.110 --> 05:17:06.120 align:start position:0%

05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%

election officials have been negligent
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%

05:23:50.990 --> 05:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that New
 
05:23:56.390 --> 05:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently has a desperate
 
05:23:58.470 --> 05:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
shortage of mental health practitioners
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
and patients are suffering as a result
 
05:24:03.390 --> 05:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
and if I know that in 14 states in the
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
district of Colombia art therapists have
 
05:24:08.030 --> 05:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
been allowed to have licenses to
 
05:24:09.670 --> 05:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
practice in this
 
05:24:12.350 --> 05:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
capacity and if I believe granting such
 
05:24:14.390 --> 05:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
licenses now would reduce the current
 
05:24:17.708 --> 05:24:17.718 align:start position:0%
burden on our substantially overburdened

executive branch having those audits

up to make sure good recommendations for

change are implemented is an important
 
05:32:01.948 --> 05:32:01.958 align:start position:0%
part of the job for this
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
legislature however for an audit to
 
05:32:06.830 --> 05:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
provide useful information a program has
 
05:32:09.548 --> 05:32:09.558 align:start position:0%
to have been in place with stable rules
 
05:32:11.868 --> 05:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
for a minimum of one year and preferably
 
05:32:14.110 --> 05:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
several years that is the recommendation
 
05:32:16.270 --> 05:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
the committee received from the director
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
of the audit division of the legislative
 
05:32:20.910 --> 05:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
budget assistant the problem is that the
 
05:32:22.708 --> 05:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
rules for the education Freedom account
 
05:32:24.990 --> 05:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
program were just approved by the joint
 
05:32:26.788 --> 05:32:26.798 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
05:32:29.390 --> 05:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
rules and the final rules do differ
 
05:32:29.400 --> 05:32:30.590 align:start position:0%
rules and the final rules do differ
significantly

05:32:30.590 --> 05:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
05:32:32.548 --> 05:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
from the interim rules that it started
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
with also as we have seen there are many
 
05:32:37.548 --> 05:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
bills before the house that could affect
 
05:32:39.868 --> 05:32:39.878 align:start position:0%
this program and there are more bills
 
05:32:41.590 --> 05:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
before the other body if any of those
 
05:32:43.868 --> 05:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
bills passed they would also affect the
 
05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
operation of the program if the state
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
has to spend the resources of the audit
 
05:32:50.470 --> 05:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
division to do the audit and at the
 
05:32:52.110 --> 05:32:52.120 align:start position:0%

done in a time frame which will provide
useful

05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
useful
 
05:33:00.030 --> 05:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
information if done too soon it won
 
05:33:01.548 --> 05:33:01.558 align:start position:0%
won't be an audit of the actual program
 
05:33:03.788 --> 05:33:03.798 align:start position:0%
as it operates and would operate into
 
05:33:05.910 --> 05:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
the future that could result in
 
05:33:08.310 --> 05:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
inconclusive and inaccurate results from
 
05:33:10.350 --> 05:33:10.360 align:start position:0%

reasons not to pass this bill was

because if a person has an allergic

05:54:38.190 --> 05:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr Speaker I rise
 
05:54:39.990 --> 05:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to the majority
 
05:54:43.708 --> 05:54:43.718 align:start position:0%
amendment 0399 to House Bill
 
05:54:47.190 --> 05:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
1330 the majority Amendment repeals the
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
board of medical technicians and ends
 
05:54:52.468 --> 05:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
the registration of individuals who work
 
05:54:55.390 --> 05:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
in medical fields and both have contact

divert opioid
 
05:55:01.788 --> 05:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
drugs we would revert to the private
 
05:55:04.310 --> 05:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
sector to prevent drug diversion and
 
05:55:06.070 --> 05:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
there is good evidence that that has
 
05:55:06.080 --> 05:55:07.350 align:start position:0%
there is good evidence that that has
been

05:55:07.350 --> 05:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
ineffective this board was established
 
05:55:13.510 --> 05:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
in 2016 in response to the hepatitis C
 
05:55:16.910 --> 05:55:16.920 align:start position:0%

had procedures 32 patients were
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
identified with active hepatitis C
 
05:55:45.110 --> 05:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
identical to the technicians virus and
 
05:55:47.590 --> 05:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
27 additional patients had evidence of
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
past hepatitis C infection but their
 
05:55:52.590 --> 05:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
virus could not be

2015 the US attorney for New Hampshire
 
05:56:23.150 --> 05:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
described him as a serial
 
05:56:25.990 --> 05:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
infector Newsweek quoted this technician
 
05:56:29.150 --> 05:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
as saying somebody has to tell how it's
 
05:56:32.310 --> 05:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
done how easy it is and how the
 
05:56:34.990 --> 05:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
structure of the hospitals isn't any
 
05:56:39.030 --> 05:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
good to stop it he told how he hid his
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
drug use how he manipulated staffing
 
05:56:44.590 --> 05:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
agencies to continue to get new hospital
 
05:56:47.430 --> 05:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
jobs and how he was ultimately caught
 
05:56:49.708 --> 05:56:49.718 align:start position:0%
when the hepatitis C outbreak occurred
 
05:56:52.910 --> 05:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
at exitor hospital the last of the 19
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals in eight states where he had
 
05:56:58.788 --> 05:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
worked clearly the private sector was
 
05:57:01.708 --> 05:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
totally ineffective in protecting the
 
05:57:05.070 --> 05:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
public as a hospital trustee I know that
 
05:57:07.628 --> 05:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
I have learned to suspect applications
 
05:57:09.590 --> 05:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
from people who have moved from
 
05:57:11.750 --> 05:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to
 
05:57:13.910 --> 05:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and yet despite the
 
05:57:16.270 --> 05:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
testimony of the New Hampshire Hospital
 
05:57:18.910 --> 05:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
Association and others the majority
 
05:57:21.110 --> 05:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
wants us to remove this registration
 
05:57:24.110 --> 05:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
process that deters serial infectors
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
from applying for jobs in New
 
05:57:29.150 --> 05:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire was the first
 
05:57:31.230 --> 05:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
state to require registration of such
 
05:57:33.350 --> 05:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
technicians and there have been no
 
05:57:35.590 --> 05:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
similar outbreaks in the state
 
05:57:37.830 --> 05:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
subsequently just by requiring
 
05:57:40.190 --> 05:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
registration we deter most of these
 
05:57:42.868 --> 05:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
people who Skip from state to state one
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
step ahead of the law from applying to
 
05:57:47.948 --> 05:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
positions in New Hampshire according to
 
05:57:49.548 --> 05:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
the association of surgical
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
technologists as of now 12 states
 
05:57:54.190 --> 05:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
require certification of surgical
 
05:57:56.628 --> 05:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
technologists and three more besides New
 
05:57:58.868 --> 05:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire require Reg
 
05:58:01.350 --> 05:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
registration I urge you all to defeat
 
05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment so the minority Amendment
 
05:58:05.548 --> 05:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
which would continue to protect your
 
05:58:07.628 --> 05:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
constituents and the public can be
 
05:58:11.190 --> 05:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
brought forward I thank
 
05:58:14.190 --> 05:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
you the member from hookit
 
05:58:15.948 --> 05:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
representative yakubovich is recognized
 
05:58:21.910 --> 05:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:26.718 --> 05:58:28.590 align:start position:0%
 
Speaker

05:58:28.590 --> 05:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
05:58:29.990 --> 05:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
so the registration of medical
 
05:58:32.830 --> 05:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
technicians is extremely rare in the US
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
and in the existing structure we're
 
05:58:36.548 --> 05:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
already talking about layers and layers
 
05:58:38.910 --> 05:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
of Institutions that oversee and work
 
05:58:40.830 --> 05:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
with the technicians because technicians
 
05:58:43.468 --> 05:58:43.478 align:start position:0%
work inside a hospital or inside a
 
05:58:47.430 --> 05:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
lab um I I I want to we want to pass
 
05:58:48.670 --> 05:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment the majority of the
 
05:58:49.990 --> 05:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee because shifting of
 
05:58:51.430 --> 05:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility is very dangerous
 
05:58:53.310 --> 05:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
faceless bureaucracy is not going to
 
05:58:56.670 --> 05:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
help much when when there are already
 
05:58:58.150 --> 05:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
layers of people people that are
 
05:59:00.510 --> 05:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
responsible like the hospital trustees
 
05:59:02.468 --> 05:59:02.478 align:start position:0%
the Insurance Corporation for the
 
05:59:05.190 --> 05:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
hospital the hospital administrators the
 
05:59:08.510 --> 05:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
doctors the nurses the staff should see
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
who they hire and what they do to
 
05:59:12.788 --> 05:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
patients they've promised not to do harm
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
and they and they fall back on the
 
05:59:19.350 --> 05:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy to protect uh their
 
05:59:21.430 --> 05:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
business there's a break in the chain of
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
command and they should be responsible
 
05:59:25.830 --> 05:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
on what happens to the patients that's
 
05:59:27.590 --> 05:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
why we're repealing this unnecessary
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
Neary registration of medical
 
05:59:30.400 --> 05:59:31.990 align:start position:0%
Neary registration of medical
technicians

05:59:31.990 --> 05:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
technicians
 
05:59:34.510 --> 05:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
um it's holding us back from providing
 
05:59:36.990 --> 05:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
better Services the health care facili
 
05:59:39.230 --> 05:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
is already struggling to hire
 
05:59:41.910 --> 05:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
workers and if we remove this
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
barrier uh by eliminating registration
 
05:59:48.110 --> 05:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
in the field we provide better service
 
05:59:49.590 --> 05:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
to the public so please vote for the
 
05:59:52.830 --> 05:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:55.110 --> 05:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
you representative Marsh request a
 
05:59:56.910 --> 05:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
division vote this will be a division
 
06:00:05.070 --> 06:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:09.548 --> 06:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:12.830 --> 06:00:12.840 align:start position:0%

06:00:14.990 --> 06:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
call who
 
06:00:17.430 --> 06:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
did and it is sufficiently seconded this
 
06:00:26.510 --> 06:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:26.520 --> 06:01:21.150 align:start position:0%

06:01:23.110 --> 06:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
the question is on Amendment
 
06:01:26.990 --> 06:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
0399 H this is a roll call vote
 
06:01:28.590 --> 06:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
represent of marsh has recognized for
 
06:01:28.600 --> 06:01:33.190 align:start position:0%
represent of marsh has recognized for
parliamentary

06:01:33.190 --> 06:01:33.200 align:start position:0%

inquiry Mr
 
06:01:37.868 --> 06:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know night shift junkies
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
have been discouraged from plaguing New
 
06:01:42.190 --> 06:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by the existing registration
 
06:01:44.948 --> 06:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
process and if I know both hospitals and
 
06:01:46.868 --> 06:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
confessed night shift junkies have said
 
06:01:49.350 --> 06:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
the hospital vetting process is totally
 
06:01:51.948 --> 06:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
inadequate to protect the public and if
 
06:01:53.830 --> 06:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want another massive and
 
06:01:56.030 --> 06:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
expensive outbreak of disease spread by
 
06:01:58.390 --> 06:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
the dirty needles of night shift junkies
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
to affect my friends and neighbors would
 
06:02:03.310 --> 06:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
I not press the red button and defeat
 
06:02:06.270 --> 06:02:06.280 align:start position:0%

06:02:15.310 --> 06:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know

that the actions of one bad
 
06:02:21.110 --> 06:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
actor however heus are not reason to
 
06:02:23.670 --> 06:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
require thousands of technicians to
 
06:02:26.590 --> 06:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
register and pay the fees if I know that
 
06:02:28.430 --> 06:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
these technicians never work
 
06:02:30.430 --> 06:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
independently but only under the
 
06:02:32.750 --> 06:02:32.760 align:start position:0%

06:20:50.510 --> 06:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:20:53.070 --> 06:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
regarding honoring specific events and
 
06:20:57.468 --> 06:20:57.478 align:start position:0%
causes on first glance house Bill 1537
 
06:20:59.510 --> 06:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
appears to be such a
 
06:21:02.750 --> 06:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill and as you know the those bills
 
06:21:05.230 --> 06:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
that come to this house from the Edna
 
06:21:08.310 --> 06:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
committee often come with an
 
06:21:11.310 --> 06:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
itl motion because among it is an
 
06:21:13.150 --> 06:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
agreement among the members of the
 
06:21:15.310 --> 06:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
committee that there are more productive
 
06:21:16.990 --> 06:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
options for these
 
06:21:19.590 --> 06:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
requests House Bill
 
06:21:21.830 --> 06:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
5357 on land
 
06:21:24.590 --> 06:21:24.600 align:start position:0%

06:21:26.150 --> 06:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
commemoration or
 
06:21:30.670 --> 06:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
Fanfare and this is not a simple Bill
 
06:21:33.590 --> 06:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
the subject de deserves much more than a
 
06:21:38.150 --> 06:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
quick look House Bill 1357 recognizes
 
06:21:40.830 --> 06:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
that before there was New Hampshire
 
06:21:43.070 --> 06:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
there was a land called
 
06:21:46.750 --> 06:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
andak and that the abanaki Penacook and
 
06:21:50.468 --> 06:21:50.478 align:start position:0%

06:22:00.070 --> 06:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
mountains rivers streams and forests
 
06:22:03.230 --> 06:22:03.240 align:start position:0%

06:22:07.150 --> 06:22:07.160 align:start position:0%
land remains magical and loved by us all
 
06:22:09.990 --> 06:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
this land is a Continuum inhabited by
 
06:22:13.230 --> 06:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
many people and its history is
 
06:22:15.708 --> 06:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
important regardless of who lived here
 
06:22:18.030 --> 06:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
or who lives here today the natural
 
06:22:21.350 --> 06:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
beauty of our state remains and is and
 
06:22:24.830 --> 06:22:24.840 align:start position:0%

06:22:34.628 --> 06:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
motion by voting red so that another

06:22:40.990 --> 06:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
you the member from Hudson

06:22:58.708 --> 06:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
oh thank
 
06:23:03.270 --> 06:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:23:06.548 --> 06:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
um so this bill would amend RSA 1
 
06:23:07.830 --> 06:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
concerning the boundaries of the State
 
06:23:09.788 --> 06:23:09.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to acknowledge that
 
06:23:11.910 --> 06:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
there were people here before us which
 
06:23:14.270 --> 06:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
is uh not
 
06:23:14.280 --> 06:23:16.350 align:start position:0%
is uh not
disputable

06:23:16.350 --> 06:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
disputable
 
06:23:18.708 --> 06:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
um and while we're sure the sponsors of
 
06:23:20.230 --> 06:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
the bill intended it just be a
 
06:23:21.468 --> 06:23:21.478 align:start position:0%
respectful acknowledgement of the
 
06:23:23.670 --> 06:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
peoples who are here before us and to
 
06:23:25.070 --> 06:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
keep the people in New Hampshire aware
 
06:23:27.788 --> 06:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
of that history there is concern about
 
06:23:29.110 --> 06:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
how that acknowledgement might be
 
06:23:31.468 --> 06:23:31.478 align:start position:0%
construed in the future while we
 
06:23:33.070 --> 06:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
understand the sponsors and most of the
 
06:23:34.628 --> 06:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
supporters do not intend this
 
06:23:37.190 --> 06:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement to support possible land
 
06:23:39.430 --> 06:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
claims we must always be aware of
 
06:23:41.990 --> 06:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
possible unintended consequences of
 
06:23:44.270 --> 06:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
legislation the statute created by the
 
06:23:46.030 --> 06:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
current legislation will likely persist
 
06:23:48.590 --> 06:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
for many years I mean it's RSA 1 which
 
06:23:50.830 --> 06:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
defines the boundaries of this
 
06:23:54.910 --> 06:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
state and uh even uh during our uh
 
06:23:57.430 --> 06:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee hearing we had at least one
 
06:24:00.430 --> 06:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
person who testified and and uh talked
 
06:24:03.070 --> 06:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
about restorative justice in the context
 
06:24:05.750 --> 06:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill which was
 
06:24:08.270 --> 06:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
concerning and uh the other thing is we
 
06:24:11.910 --> 06:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
got uh testimony from a tribal
 
06:24:15.190 --> 06:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
genealogist who said that uh there's
 
06:24:17.310 --> 06:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
conflict between groups of the
 
06:24:19.948 --> 06:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
indigenous people in New York and Canada
 
06:24:23.190 --> 06:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
over how this should be handled and uh
 
06:24:24.548 --> 06:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
this person said it' be best for the
 
06:24:26.590 --> 06:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire not to meddle in
 
06:24:29.590 --> 06:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
that situation so because of all that uh
 
06:24:32.830 --> 06:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
those reasons I ask you to vote um green
 
06:24:39.468 --> 06:24:39.478 align:start position:0%

Hampshire has an opportunity in address
 
06:38:54.628 --> 06:38:54.638 align:start position:0%
an all victimization done
 
06:38:56.670 --> 06:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
at the hands of our facilities
 
06:38:58.868 --> 06:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
especially at minimum through House Bill
 
06:39:02.190 --> 06:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
1677 process all victims retain their
 
06:39:04.548 --> 06:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
right to choose the court process
 
06:39:05.990 --> 06:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
however this process ought to be
 
06:39:09.150 --> 06:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
available to all victims who choose so
 
06:39:11.628 --> 06:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh although the appropriation is an
 
06:39:14.190 --> 06:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
extremely large
 
06:39:16.548 --> 06:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
allocation I'm reminded of the tax
 
06:39:18.628 --> 06:39:18.638 align:start position:0%
dollars that went towards perpetration
 
06:39:21.868 --> 06:39:21.878 align:start position:0%
of of these acts so I ask that you
 
06:39:24.948 --> 06:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
support the victims
 
06:39:28.548 --> 06:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
the victims of in in this situation and
 
06:39:32.190 --> 06:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
we add all victims the opportunity to go
 
06:39:37.868 --> 06:39:37.878 align:start position:0%

Edwards uh thank you Mr Speaker I I'd
 
06:39:47.030 --> 06:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
like you to understand just a little bit
 
06:39:50.350 --> 06:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
of the process that gotd us here the uh
 
06:39:52.830 --> 06:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
for the first time in decades the state
 
06:39:54.670 --> 06:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has stood up to the
 
06:39:57.990 --> 06:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
plate and said we are responsible and we
 
06:40:00.468 --> 06:40:00.478 align:start position:0%
are going to be accountable for writing
 
06:40:04.230 --> 06:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
the wrongs of many many decades where
 
06:40:06.590 --> 06:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
kids that have been incarcerated in the
 
06:40:10.030 --> 06:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
Youth Development Centers uh have been
 
06:40:13.628 --> 06:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
warehoused to in a way in which um
 
06:40:16.350 --> 06:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
physical and sexual abuse seems to have
 
06:40:20.030 --> 06:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
been fairly current uh common and and
 
06:40:22.030 --> 06:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
too much of a part of the culture that's
 
06:40:24.190 --> 06:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing anecdotally don't admit
 
06:40:26.708 --> 06:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
that into court but that's what I
 
06:40:30.190 --> 06:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
understand and so what the AG has done
 
06:40:33.910 --> 06:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
is uh he and his office have set up a
 
06:40:36.590 --> 06:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
settlement fund so that we can
 
06:40:40.628 --> 06:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
efficiently process hundreds of
 
06:40:44.708 --> 06:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
claims and the key claims that we must
 
06:40:49.590 --> 06:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
address are the sexual and physical
 
06:40:52.990 --> 06:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
abuse like any project this is a this is
 
06:40:55.190 --> 06:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
a new project
 
06:40:56.788 --> 06:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing you need to worry
 
06:40:59.510 --> 06:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
about is scope creep if you make the
 
06:41:02.510 --> 06:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
scope too big your Project's going to
 
06:41:06.590 --> 06:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
fail and so with a lot of thought we and
 
06:41:11.430 --> 06:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
and debate we are not we don't want the
 
06:41:14.310 --> 06:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse included in this bill
 
06:41:16.590 --> 06:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
which is what this amendment does
 
06:41:18.708 --> 06:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
because first of all emotional abuse is
 
06:41:21.468 --> 06:41:21.478 align:start position:0%
very tough I think to to adjudicate I
 
06:41:23.030 --> 06:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
think just the mere fact that you're
 
06:41:23.040 --> 06:41:24.430 align:start position:0%
think just the mere fact that you're
incarcerated

06:41:24.430 --> 06:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
06:41:27.270 --> 06:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
would uh legitimately would would would
 
06:41:30.150 --> 06:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
many feel like emotional abuse and
 
06:41:32.468 --> 06:41:32.478 align:start position:0%
because it's it's it's messy and it
 
06:41:36.910 --> 06:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
would open up uh the settlement fund to
 
06:41:40.948 --> 06:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
a a scope creep that is beyond what
 
06:41:43.868 --> 06:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
we're ready to do initially and we may
 
06:41:47.350 --> 06:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
never get to that but don't think for a
 
06:41:50.150 --> 06:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
moment that those kids who thought that
 
06:41:52.750 --> 06:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
they were emotionally abused don't have
 
06:41:55.788 --> 06:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
recourse there's always been a method
 
06:41:58.788 --> 06:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
for them to file a complaint with the AG
 
06:42:01.230 --> 06:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
and to have it adjudicated and that's
 
06:42:04.270 --> 06:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
that Avenue remains open to them what
 
06:42:06.190 --> 06:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
we've done is we've set up a settlement
 
06:42:10.030 --> 06:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
fund to efficiently process a large
 
06:42:13.150 --> 06:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
large number of cases and I'd ask you to
 
06:42:16.110 --> 06:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
vote against this amendment so that we
 
06:42:18.910 --> 06:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
can allow the Attorney General to focus
 
06:42:22.670 --> 06:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
on the most egregious claims and and get
 
06:42:25.150 --> 06:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
them handled as expeditiously as
 
06:42:29.788 --> 06:42:29.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:33.590 --> 06:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:37.590 --> 06:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
I I I uh I repres I um I respect the
 
06:42:40.190 --> 06:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative I'll take her question
 
06:42:42.890 --> 06:42:42.900 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
06:42:46.350 --> 06:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so much
 
06:42:48.070 --> 06:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:42:52.628 --> 06:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
are you saying that um watching a child
 
06:42:56.708 --> 06:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
get raped by uh a facilit that
 
06:43:00.110 --> 06:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
facilitates this is is less important
 
06:43:02.788 --> 06:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
and and should get less rewards of
 
06:43:04.548 --> 06:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
Damages than the one that's actually
 
06:43:06.030 --> 06:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
doing the raping and is getting
 
06:43:09.310 --> 06:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
threatened to then be raped if they tell
 
06:43:11.628 --> 06:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
anybody so so I thank you for the
 
06:43:14.590 --> 06:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
question and I I understand your concern
 
06:43:17.150 --> 06:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
to be whether or not uh rape would be
 
06:43:19.750 --> 06:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
included I'd say rape is part of the
 
06:43:21.990 --> 06:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and that and that's
 
06:43:24.670 --> 06:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
clearly the major reason we're doing
 
06:43:28.948 --> 06:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
this is to um uh adjudicate and and pay
 
06:43:31.628 --> 06:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
out and try to uh compensate for their
 
06:43:34.590 --> 06:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
pain and anguish uh the the monies that
 
06:43:37.548 --> 06:43:37.558 align:start position:0%
would help them deal with the the rape
 
06:43:39.868 --> 06:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that answers your question
 
06:43:42.110 --> 06:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
and I I think we're done does the member
 
06:43:44.830 --> 06:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
yield to further questions no no member
 
06:43:46.708 --> 06:43:46.718 align:start position:0%

what I say and vote with me um house B
 
06:49:28.750 --> 06:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:33.230 --> 06:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
start okay but we can act now to make it
 
06:49:35.070 --> 06:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
an even more effective response to a
 
06:49:39.070 --> 06:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
critical situation Amendment 1022 H will
 
06:49:41.270 --> 06:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
help to do that according to the
 
06:49:42.590 --> 06:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Children and Family
 
06:49:45.628 --> 06:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
Services director from 1990 to the
 
06:49:45.638 --> 06:49:48.030 align:start position:0%
Services director from 1990 to the
present

06:49:48.030 --> 06:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
present
 
06:49:51.070 --> 06:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
4,776 children were housed at this new
 
06:49:54.150 --> 06:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
new youth center and its predic cessor
 
06:49:55.388 --> 06:49:55.398 align:start position:0%
they've already there have already been
 
06:49:58.350 --> 06:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
close to 500 cases of abuse filed in the
 
06:50:01.788 --> 06:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
courts and that number could increase as
 
06:50:04.230 --> 06:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
a former County attorney this situation
 
06:50:07.468 --> 06:50:07.478 align:start position:0%
resonates with me it's clear based on
 
06:50:09.310 --> 06:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
the number of cases filed against the
 
06:50:11.548 --> 06:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
state that the financial cap on
 
06:50:14.270 --> 06:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
settlements in this bill is artificially
 
06:50:17.590 --> 06:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
low at 1.5 million it should be
 
06:50:21.110 --> 06:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
increased to 4.5 million this is a
 
06:50:23.150 --> 06:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
significant increase but there's there's
 
06:50:24.948 --> 06:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
a cause to do this from a legal
 
06:50:28.030 --> 06:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
standpoint the state by taking complete
 
06:50:30.430 --> 06:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
custody and control of these children
 
06:50:33.670 --> 06:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
had a fiduciary duty to them we promised
 
06:50:35.910 --> 06:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
to provide the highest standard of
 
06:50:39.388 --> 06:50:39.398 align:start position:0%
care if this case goes to civil court
 
06:50:41.788 --> 06:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
all the plaintiffs have to prove by a
 
06:50:44.910 --> 06:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence which is
 
06:50:48.350 --> 06:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
50.1% likelihood is that the abuse
 
06:50:50.948 --> 06:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
happened as lawmakers we must be
 
06:50:53.110 --> 06:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
prepared to respond to several judges
 
06:50:55.788 --> 06:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
ments against the state of New Hampshire
 
06:50:58.868 --> 06:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the state has already
 
06:51:01.388 --> 06:51:01.398 align:start position:0%
indicted 12 former employees and
 
06:51:04.628 --> 06:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
Promises to indict more these employees
 
06:51:06.590 --> 06:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
account for the abuse of close to one
 
06:51:09.430 --> 06:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
half of the child victims and the state
 
06:51:11.548 --> 06:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
believes it can prove the defendants
 
06:51:14.150 --> 06:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
abuse these kids Beyond A Reasonable
 
06:51:18.788 --> 06:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:21.628 --> 06:51:21.638 align:start position:0%
likelihood for our purposes this means
 
06:51:24.510 --> 06:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
these cases will either be settled and
 
06:51:27.150 --> 06:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
receive a financial award from this fund
 
06:51:30.030 --> 06:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
that we are creating or the cases go to
 
06:51:32.510 --> 06:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
trial the plaintiffs have several
 
06:51:34.230 --> 06:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers already committed to working
 
06:51:36.190 --> 06:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
these cases on behalf of the child
 
06:51:39.590 --> 06:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
victims so far the attorney general has
 
06:51:42.590 --> 06:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
one it's entirely possible that if any
 
06:51:44.750 --> 06:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
of these cases or several of these cases
 
06:51:47.070 --> 06:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
go to trial that when jurors hear what
 
06:51:49.910 --> 06:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
happened to these children multi-million
 
06:51:52.350 --> 06:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
dollar verdicts in single cases will
 
06:51:52.360 --> 06:51:53.788 align:start position:0%
dollar verdicts in single cases will
result

06:51:53.788 --> 06:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
result
 
06:51:55.868 --> 06:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
it's critical to note some of the cases
 
06:51:58.270 --> 06:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
in federal court in recent years
 
06:52:01.868 --> 06:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
exceeded $20 million even for incidences
 
06:52:05.190 --> 06:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
less brutal than child rape the federal
 
06:52:07.830 --> 06:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
court draws from a similar jury pool as
 
06:52:10.150 --> 06:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
our state Superior Court in miramac
 
06:52:12.708 --> 06:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
County where these cases would be heard
 
06:52:15.150 --> 06:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
you have to anticipate the same jury
 
06:52:17.110 --> 06:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
pool will yield similar
 
06:52:19.310 --> 06:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes it's in the state's best
 
06:52:22.070 --> 06:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
financial interest to agree to a process
 
06:52:25.070 --> 06:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
that will resolve all or almost all of
 
06:52:26.910 --> 06:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
these child victim cases as
 
06:52:30.110 --> 06:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as possible with as little
 
06:52:31.948 --> 06:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
additional trauma to the victims as
 
06:52:34.388 --> 06:52:34.398 align:start position:0%
possible after all it's the right thing
 
06:52:38.628 --> 06:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
to do Amendment 1022 expands the cap on
 
06:52:41.510 --> 06:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
settlements to 4.5 million a more
 
06:52:44.190 --> 06:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
realistic cap on settlement amounts if
 
06:52:46.310 --> 06:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
we want the plaintiffs to come to the
 
06:52:48.468 --> 06:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
table with their claims and avoid going
 
06:52:51.190 --> 06:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
to civil court where $10 million or
 
06:52:53.270 --> 06:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
higher dollar claims could result
 
06:52:55.750 --> 06:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
we must be realistic about the logical
 
06:52:58.388 --> 06:52:58.398 align:start position:0%
and likely Financial risks we should
 
06:53:00.270 --> 06:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
increase the cap the state is willing to
 
06:53:02.708 --> 06:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
award in this process I ask that you
 
06:53:05.590 --> 06:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
join me in more properly compensating
 
06:53:07.708 --> 06:53:07.718 align:start position:0%
any victims of abuse while in the
 
06:53:10.150 --> 06:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
state's custody please support Amendment

sorry the cap in 10
 
06:53:47.468 --> 06:53:47.478 align:start position:0%
1677 is $1.5 million for sexual abuse
 
06:53:47.478 --> 06:53:48.510 align:start position:0%
1677 is $1.5 million for sexual abuse
and

06:53:48.510 --> 06:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:51.150 --> 06:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
$150,000 for fiscal
 
06:53:55.350 --> 06:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
abuse these C apps were set as a result
 
06:53:59.868 --> 06:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
of the AG looking out across the country
 
06:54:04.430 --> 06:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
for what settlements were out there
 
06:54:09.948 --> 06:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
for uh sexual abuse and physical
 
06:54:14.948 --> 06:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
abuse and that was the number that
 
06:54:19.310 --> 06:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
the the dollars that the AG came to us
 
06:54:23.070 --> 06:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
with as what was the I don't want to
 
06:54:25.548 --> 06:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
call it the average settlement because
 
06:54:28.468 --> 06:54:28.478 align:start position:0%
it wasn't necessarily adding up the
 
06:54:31.230 --> 06:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
figures and coming up with a number it
 
06:54:34.430 --> 06:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
was looking at all of the cases that
 
06:54:35.708 --> 06:54:35.718 align:start position:0%
were out
 
06:54:35.718 --> 06:54:37.590 align:start position:0%
were out
there

06:54:37.590 --> 06:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:54:40.388 --> 06:54:40.398 align:start position:0%
now as uh the representative from
 
06:54:44.388 --> 06:54:44.398 align:start position:0%
conquer said you don't have to choose
 
06:54:49.750 --> 06:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
the process that we've put together in
 
06:54:49.760 --> 06:54:51.590 align:start position:0%
the process that we've put together in
1677

06:54:51.590 --> 06:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
1677
 
06:54:56.030 --> 06:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
1677 is designed as
 
06:55:00.430 --> 06:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
a trauma and victim
 
06:55:05.030 --> 06:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
centered process as opposed to going to
 
06:55:08.788 --> 06:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
court which is not
 
06:55:11.468 --> 06:55:11.478 align:start position:0%
necessarily a victim or
 
06:55:17.830 --> 06:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
trauma centered thing but this the cap
 
06:55:21.230 --> 06:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
that we have put in the bill I believe
 
06:55:25.910 --> 06:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
will actually solve all of the problems
 
06:55:30.350 --> 06:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
that were caused and I would agree that
 
06:55:34.430 --> 06:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
these are absolutely horrible to think
 
06:55:37.350 --> 06:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
that this was going on in our youth
 
06:55:42.830 --> 06:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
centers over a long period of time and
 
06:55:48.070 --> 06:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
it was only recently that the AG in his
 
06:55:52.270 --> 06:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
um work discovered the horrific nature
 
06:55:56.030 --> 06:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
of what was going on so I ask that you
 
06:55:59.388 --> 06:55:59.398 align:start position:0%
vote red and keep the Caps that are
 
06:56:01.510 --> 06:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
currently in
 
06:56:07.590 --> 06:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
1677 of 1.5 million for sexual abuse and
 
06:56:11.990 --> 06:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
150,000 for fiscal abuse thank you Mr

important bill and if I know the intent
 
06:57:34.548 --> 06:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
of this legislation is to provide an
 
06:57:37.430 --> 06:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
alternative for claimants to settle
 
06:57:39.990 --> 06:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
their cases through the settlement fund
 
06:57:43.868 --> 06:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
process as opposed to taking cases to
 
06:57:46.990 --> 06:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
court which is a must much more
 
06:57:50.830 --> 06:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
costly set process for the state and for
 
06:57:55.670 --> 06:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
the victim and if I know that the cap on
 
06:57:59.430 --> 06:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
settlement is too if it is too low
 
06:58:02.070 --> 06:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
claimants will choose Court over going
 
06:58:04.868 --> 06:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
through the settlement fund process and
 
06:58:07.548 --> 06:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
if I know this amendment raises the cap
 
06:58:09.910 --> 06:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
to a more realistic level which will
 
06:58:12.270 --> 06:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
encourage claimants to use the
 
06:58:15.430 --> 06:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
settlement process would I now vote Yes
 
06:58:18.110 --> 06:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:19.948 --> 06:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
amendment chair recognizes
 
06:58:21.628 --> 06:58:21.638 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder for parliamentary
 
06:58:27.388 --> 06:58:27.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:30.628 --> 06:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
06:58:32.750 --> 06:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
know that the attorney general made a
 
06:58:35.150 --> 06:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
thorough study of rewards for sexual
 
06:58:38.350 --> 06:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
abuse attacks on children by authorities
 
06:58:41.628 --> 06:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
and that study led to a proposal to
 
06:58:44.708 --> 06:58:44.718 align:start position:0%
create a settlement fund of $100 million
 
06:58:47.350 --> 06:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
to use in a new system to avoid going to
 
06:58:50.830 --> 06:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
court if the damaged parties accepted it
 
06:58:53.030 --> 06:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that the attorney
 
06:58:55.990 --> 06:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
for the approximate 500 litigants kept
 
06:58:58.270 --> 06:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
trying to increase the caps on the
 
06:59:00.150 --> 06:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
settlements offered and if I know that
 
06:59:02.070 --> 06:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the Caps or the allowed
 
06:59:05.350 --> 06:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
damages will make even that huge sum be
 
06:59:07.628 --> 06:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
insufficient would I now press the red
 
06:59:09.670 --> 06:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
button to keep from making this effort
 
06:59:11.990 --> 06:59:12.000 align:start position:0%

okay it's a long day thank you Mr
 
07:08:08.468 --> 07:08:08.478 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
07:08:10.270 --> 07:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
best way to protect New Hampshire's
 
07:08:12.830 --> 07:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
precious Lobster stock especially female
 
07:08:15.310 --> 07:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
egg bearing lobsters and support
 
07:08:16.830 --> 07:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
economically important lobstering
 
07:08:19.070 --> 07:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire is the only
 
07:08:21.670 --> 07:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
way by highly using High highly
 
07:08:23.510 --> 07:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
professional career seasoned and easily
 
07:08:25.070 --> 07:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
regulated lobstermen to catch these
 
07:08:27.788 --> 07:08:27.798 align:start position:0%
valuable creatures and if I believe that
 
07:08:29.750 --> 07:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
personal hand catching of lobsters by
 
07:08:31.628 --> 07:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
individual scuba divers with limited
 
07:08:33.468 --> 07:08:33.478 align:start position:0%
experience will complicate the
 
07:08:36.230 --> 07:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring and regulation process of the
 
07:08:38.670 --> 07:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
already overburdened Marine Patrol
 
07:08:40.388 --> 07:08:40.398 align:start position:0%
officers of our dear fish and game
 
07:08:43.270 --> 07:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
department and furthermore if I believe
 
07:08:44.830 --> 07:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
that the safety of divers will be
 
07:08:46.788 --> 07:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
diminished as their ability to hand
 
07:08:48.948 --> 07:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
catch lobsters will most likely take
 
07:08:51.430 --> 07:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
place where Lobster stocks reside
 
07:08:53.868 --> 07:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
therefore creating risk to divers
 
07:08:56.388 --> 07:08:56.398 align:start position:0%
entangling themselves in the Nets trap
 
07:08:58.910 --> 07:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
lines and other dangerous gear that our
 
07:09:01.270 --> 07:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
Lobster industry uses would I now vote
 
07:09:05.110 --> 07:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
no on House Bill 1297 so the better
 
07:09:09.030 --> 07:09:09.040 align:start position:0%

07:09:16.190 --> 07:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
07:09:19.110 --> 07:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
state directly to our South does allow
 
07:09:21.590 --> 07:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
scuba and free divers to harvest small
 
07:09:23.670 --> 07:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
amounts of lobster for personal use and
 
07:09:25.910 --> 07:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
they have had zero issues with
 
07:09:28.548 --> 07:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement zero issues with safety and
 
07:09:30.750 --> 07:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
zero issues with conflicts between
 
07:09:34.110 --> 07:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
divers and lobstermen and if I know that
 
07:09:36.788 --> 07:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
none of the usual Pro conservation
 
07:09:38.948 --> 07:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
pro-animal groups opposed this bill at
 
07:09:41.430 --> 07:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
all but in fact the main opposition in
 
07:09:43.430 --> 07:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee was a long line of people
 
07:09:45.310 --> 07:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
representing the professional Lobster
 
07:09:46.948 --> 07:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
industry who stand to lose the high
 
07:09:48.628 --> 07:09:48.638 align:start position:0%

07:09:50.628 --> 07:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
individuals have access to sustainably

harvesting small amounts for personal
 
07:09:56.350 --> 07:09:56.360 align:start position:0%

07:09:58.270 --> 07:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
that one of the most preeminent Wildlife
 
07:10:00.230 --> 07:10:00.240 align:start position:0%

07:10:07.548 --> 07:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
passionately supportive of this bill and
 
07:10:10.310 --> 07:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
in fact debunked the myths that divers
 
07:10:12.230 --> 07:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh cause damage when harvesting uh
 
07:10:14.070 --> 07:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
sustainable amounts would I now press

open and Clos hunting seasons for
 
07:19:09.468 --> 07:19:09.478 align:start position:0%
garious for various game species are
 
07:19:11.310 --> 07:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
managed after
 
07:19:14.230 --> 07:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
consideration on the advice of research
 
07:19:16.150 --> 07:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
of wildlife
 
07:19:18.590 --> 07:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
biologist and Mr Speaker if I know that
 
07:19:20.670 --> 07:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment requires the executive
 
07:19:23.468 --> 07:19:23.478 align:start position:0%
director to permit gray squirrels to be
 
07:19:26.230 --> 07:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
hunted year round rather than during an
 
07:19:28.708 --> 07:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
open or a closed season like other
 
07:19:32.030 --> 07:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
species of small game and finally Mr
 
07:19:34.910 --> 07:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I believe that New Hampshire
 
07:19:37.310 --> 07:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
wildlife should be managed through the
 
07:19:39.110 --> 07:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
advice of wildlife
 
07:19:41.468 --> 07:19:41.478 align:start position:0%
biologists rather than the whim of
 
07:19:43.670 --> 07:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislators then would I push the red
 
07:19:45.948 --> 07:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
button and vote no on this amendment so
 
07:19:48.510 --> 07:19:48.520 align:start position:0%

to speak against the committee
 
07:24:50.468 --> 07:24:50.478 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:24:52.308 --> 07:24:52.318 align:start position:0%
permitting a pharmacist to dispense a
 
07:24:54.708 --> 07:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
medication by a standing order requires
 
07:24:57.708 --> 07:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
a a well- evaluated protocol established
 
07:24:59.590 --> 07:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
through a broad consensus of providers
 
07:25:02.190 --> 07:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
and pharmacists using the best available
 
07:25:04.910 --> 07:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
data but a broad consensus supporting
 
07:25:07.270 --> 07:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
the use of ivermectin in covid-19 does
 
07:25:09.910 --> 07:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
not exist the majority report claims
 
07:25:11.708 --> 07:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
that icin has been shown to be helpful
 
07:25:14.708 --> 07:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
in reducing the severity and duration of
 
07:25:17.788 --> 07:25:17.798 align:start position:0%
covid-19 but this is not true there have
 
07:25:19.910 --> 07:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
been numerous studies regarding icin and
 
07:25:23.708 --> 07:25:23.718 align:start position:0%
covid-19 which sound compelling but upon
 
07:25:25.670 --> 07:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
analysis have design flaws I have
 
07:25:27.110 --> 07:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
personally reviewed many of these
 
07:25:30.548 --> 07:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
studies most studies so far are limited
 
07:25:33.510 --> 07:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
by primarily by non-blinding or no
 
07:25:35.590 --> 07:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
randomization but also by twoo small
 
07:25:37.990 --> 07:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
sample sizes the use of concominant
 
07:25:40.830 --> 07:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
medications that confound the assessment
 
07:25:42.510 --> 07:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
or poorly defined study groups and
 
07:25:44.910 --> 07:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
outcome measures and even the
 
07:25:47.590 --> 07:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
well-designed studies still have
 
07:25:49.190 --> 07:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
significant limitations such that
 
07:25:51.628 --> 07:25:51.638 align:start position:0%
definitive conclusions regarding the
 
07:25:53.708 --> 07:25:53.718 align:start position:0%
clinical efficacy of ican and the
 
07:25:56.590 --> 07:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
treatment of covid-19 cannot yet be
 
07:26:00.468 --> 07:26:00.478 align:start position:0%
reached this is not an issue of
 
07:26:02.788 --> 07:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
censorship it is simply subjecting these
 
07:26:05.110 --> 07:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
studies to the same robust analysis
 
07:26:07.708 --> 07:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
which must be given to any study
 
07:26:09.990 --> 07:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
internationally recognized independent
 
07:26:11.868 --> 07:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
groups with Decades of experience
 
07:26:14.190 --> 07:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
analyzing studies such as the
 
07:26:15.948 --> 07:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
group have determined that the few
 
07:26:19.070 --> 07:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
studies of high quality which do exist
 
07:26:20.308 --> 07:26:20.318 align:start position:0%
do not support support the use of
 
07:26:21.990 --> 07:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
ivermectin for treatment or prevention
 
07:26:25.430 --> 07:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
of covid-19 except in ongoing
 
07:26:28.110 --> 07:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
well-designed clinical
 
07:26:30.948 --> 07:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
trials this is not to say that icin is
 
07:26:33.868 --> 07:26:33.878 align:start position:0%
not a good drug it is excellent for the
 
07:26:35.590 --> 07:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
treatment of parasitic worms and has
 
07:26:37.388 --> 07:26:37.398 align:start position:0%
been around for a long time and used
 
07:26:40.510 --> 07:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
well for that purpose the minority
 
07:26:42.468 --> 07:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
already worked with the majority to
 
07:26:45.110 --> 07:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
allow off Lael use of ivermectin so that
 
07:26:48.230 --> 07:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
it can be obtained if desired standing
 
07:26:49.948 --> 07:26:49.958 align:start position:0%
orders with pharmacists should should
 
07:26:52.430 --> 07:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
not be used to dispense medications for
 
07:26:54.270 --> 07:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
indications which are not clearly
 
07:26:57.110 --> 07:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
supported by the best available medical
 
07:27:00.510 --> 07:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
evidence Ivory mechon unfortunately at
 
07:27:02.910 --> 07:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
least as of now does not yet Reach This
 
07:27:05.110 --> 07:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
level of evidence so please press the
 
07:27:07.150 --> 07:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
red button to vote no so that another

kushman thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
07:27:43.110 --> 07:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended would ensure
 
07:27:45.990 --> 07:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
granite stators have access to an FDA
 
07:27:47.868 --> 07:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
approved medication that has a drug
 
07:27:51.430 --> 07:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
safety PR profile better than Tylenol a
 
07:27:53.190 --> 07:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
standing order is a prescriptive
 
07:27:55.308 --> 07:27:55.318 align:start position:0%
protocol written by a physician or nurse
 
07:27:57.708 --> 07:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
practitioner that allows a pharmacist to
 
07:27:59.590 --> 07:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
dispense a medication without an
 
07:28:02.230 --> 07:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
individual prescription the prescriber
 
07:28:04.708 --> 07:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
writes a protocol that includes dosage
 
07:28:07.190 --> 07:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
and screening for contraindication the
 
07:28:09.990 --> 07:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
patient receives an information sheet
 
07:28:12.230 --> 07:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
that informs them of adverse effects
 
07:28:15.308 --> 07:28:15.318 align:start position:0%
indications and referral information
 
07:28:17.270 --> 07:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire one can go to
 
07:28:19.670 --> 07:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy and ask for hormonal
 
07:28:22.708 --> 07:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
contraceptives and Naran via a standing
 
07:28:25.030 --> 07:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
order these drugs both carry
 
07:28:28.910 --> 07:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
substantially more risk than ican icin
 
07:28:31.070 --> 07:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
has been used in humans for parasitic
 
07:28:34.628 --> 07:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
infections for over 30 years its success
 
07:28:36.628 --> 07:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
as an
 
07:28:38.910 --> 07:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
antiviral uh effective in reducing
 
07:28:40.990 --> 07:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
severity of symptoms of covid-19 and
 
07:28:43.030 --> 07:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
other viral illnesses is one reason
 
07:28:44.548 --> 07:28:44.558 align:start position:0%
people are willing to go to Great
 
07:28:47.990 --> 07:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
Lengths to obtain it from purchasing a
 
07:28:50.430 --> 07:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
broad to purchasing ior and formulated
 
07:28:52.548 --> 07:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
for animals people will do what they
 
07:28:54.670 --> 07:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
need to do to get their hands on this
 
07:28:57.150 --> 07:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
drug when they or their loved ones are
 
07:29:00.070 --> 07:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
sick they'll do what they have to
 
07:29:02.110 --> 07:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
another reason is that unfortunately
 
07:29:04.230 --> 07:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
medicine is becoming increasingly
 
07:29:07.308 --> 07:29:07.318 align:start position:0%
politicized this is why there is
 
07:29:11.030 --> 07:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
no um consensus on the best protocol for
 
07:29:14.110 --> 07:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
Icon but we do have many wellestablished
 
07:29:16.670 --> 07:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
protocols that Physicians who write
 
07:29:18.990 --> 07:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
these standing orders can reference and
 
07:29:19.000 --> 07:29:20.788 align:start position:0%
these standing orders can reference and
use

07:29:20.788 --> 07:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
use
 
07:29:22.830 --> 07:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
because of this politicization doctors
 
07:29:24.868 --> 07:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
are afraid to prescribe and pharmacies
 
07:29:26.308 --> 07:29:26.318 align:start position:0%
are afraid to
 
07:29:28.868 --> 07:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
dispense if we pass this bill patients
 
07:29:30.750 --> 07:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
will have access to this safe
 
07:29:34.190 --> 07:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
inexpensive generic FDA approved
 
07:29:36.868 --> 07:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
medication that is created in FDA
 
07:29:39.750 --> 07:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
regulated and inspected facilities
 
07:29:41.990 --> 07:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
formulated for
 
07:29:44.308 --> 07:29:44.318 align:start position:0%
humans this will reduce the potential
 
07:29:46.788 --> 07:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
harm of obtaining medications abroad and
 
07:29:49.590 --> 07:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
using icin formulated for animals and
 
07:29:51.350 --> 07:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
could potentially mitigate the severity
 
07:29:54.548 --> 07:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
of covid-19 and other viral illnesses we
 
07:29:56.670 --> 07:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
make experimental vaccines that have had
 
07:29:58.830 --> 07:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
no long-term safety studies with growing
 
07:30:01.468 --> 07:30:01.478 align:start position:0%
evidence of harm available at pharmacies
 
07:30:03.510 --> 07:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
without a prescription and claim it's
 
07:30:06.230 --> 07:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
because it could save lives Iver mechon
 
07:30:08.590 --> 07:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
has had over 30 years of study showing
 
07:30:11.030 --> 07:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
that it is safe and more and more
 
07:30:12.750 --> 07:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
evidence is surfacing that it is
 
07:30:15.270 --> 07:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
effective permitting it to be dispensed
 
07:30:18.070 --> 07:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
via a standing order could save lives
 
07:30:20.548 --> 07:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
please vote a to pass as amended thank

parliamentary
 
07:31:24.388 --> 07:31:24.398 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
07:31:26.150 --> 07:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
that permitting a pharmacist to dispense
 
07:31:27.868 --> 07:31:27.878 align:start position:0%
a medication by a standing order
 
07:31:30.628 --> 07:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
requires a well- evaluated protocol
 
07:31:32.430 --> 07:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
established through a broad consensus of
 
07:31:34.270 --> 07:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
providers and pharmacists using the best
 
07:31:36.750 --> 07:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
available data and that the lack of that
 
07:31:38.948 --> 07:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
consensus is not a political issue but
 
07:31:41.590 --> 07:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
because of data which is insufficient in
 
07:31:44.670 --> 07:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
the studies and that only a few have are
 
07:31:46.388 --> 07:31:46.398 align:start position:0%
actually being done at this point a few
 
07:31:48.510 --> 07:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
standing orders and if I know that the
 
07:31:52.110 --> 07:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
FDA FDA approval is for its indication
 
07:31:55.510 --> 07:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
of treating parasites not
 
07:31:57.948 --> 07:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and if I know that a broad
 
07:32:00.190 --> 07:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
consensus supporting the use of icin in
 
07:32:03.270 --> 07:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
covid-19 does not exist and that
 
07:32:05.750 --> 07:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
Ivermectin can be obtained off label
 
07:32:07.388 --> 07:32:07.398 align:start position:0%
once we've finished getting that other
 
07:32:09.990 --> 07:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
Bill through would I then press the red
 
07:32:13.350 --> 07:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
button to vote no so that another motion
 
07:32:15.868 --> 07:32:15.878 align:start position:0%
could be brought forward thank you Mr
 
07:32:18.388 --> 07:32:18.398 align:start position:0%
Speaker do you recognize the remant mark
 
07:32:21.670 --> 07:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:25.350 --> 07:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
07:32:28.430 --> 07:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
if I know that Ivor meon is already
 
07:32:31.030 --> 07:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
available over the counter in many
 
07:32:33.910 --> 07:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
countries and if I know that Ivor mechon
 
07:32:36.628 --> 07:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
is safe safer than some of the
 
07:32:38.868 --> 07:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter medicines we can
 
07:32:41.948 --> 07:32:41.958 align:start position:0%
presently buy here in New Hampshire and
 
07:32:44.230 --> 07:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
if I know that some people unable to get
 
07:32:47.270 --> 07:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
Ivor mechon over the counter here have
 
07:32:49.868 --> 07:32:49.878 align:start position:0%
been resorting to going to farm stores
 
07:32:52.230 --> 07:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
and getting it as it is formulated for
 
07:32:55.388 --> 07:32:55.398 align:start position:0%
livestock and not for people and finally
 
07:32:57.628 --> 07:32:57.638 align:start position:0%
if I know that the choice for ever so
 
07:33:00.868 --> 07:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
many people is not the choice of ior
 
07:33:02.830 --> 07:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
mecon or
 
07:33:06.948 --> 07:33:06.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines but ior meon versus
 
07:33:10.628 --> 07:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
nothing and while it might not cure you
 
07:33:13.548 --> 07:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
it's not going to hurt you would I now

07:35:53.708 --> 07:35:53.718 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 1044 and in

itl House Bill
 
07:36:02.150 --> 07:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
1044 would make a small but meaningful
 
07:36:04.948 --> 07:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
change in our state statute governing
 
07:36:07.670 --> 07:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
The Lure of healthc care
 
07:36:11.150 --> 07:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
facilities in 2016 this legislature
 
07:36:13.948 --> 07:36:13.958 align:start position:0%
added a provision to that statute
 
07:36:15.548 --> 07:36:15.558 align:start position:0%
requiring that licensed Health Care
 
07:36:18.468 --> 07:36:18.478 align:start position:0%
Facilities must serve all patients
 
07:36:23.110 --> 07:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:26.270 --> 07:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
payment House Bill 1044 would exempt
 
07:36:29.270 --> 07:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
certain facilities from that
 
07:36:31.868 --> 07:36:31.878 align:start position:0%
provision specifically it would exempt
 
07:36:33.910 --> 07:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
organizations that operate on a
 
07:36:36.708 --> 07:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
membership based business model or a
 
07:36:39.110 --> 07:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
direct payment business model meaning
 
07:36:42.670 --> 07:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
that it's not reimbursed by
 
07:36:45.230 --> 07:36:45.240 align:start position:0%

07:36:46.990 --> 07:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
majority committee
 
07:36:50.030 --> 07:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
report is that this bill would have an
 
07:36:53.590 --> 07:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
adverse effect on our critical care
 
07:36:55.990 --> 07:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals in fact the provisions in
 
07:36:58.830 --> 07:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
question were added to Statute in
 
07:37:01.548 --> 07:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
2016 we had critical care hospitals
 
07:37:04.830 --> 07:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
before that and if this bill passes
 
07:37:06.388 --> 07:37:06.398 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to believe we will not
 
07:37:09.548 --> 07:37:09.558 align:start position:0%
have critical care hospitals after
 
07:37:12.510 --> 07:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
that furthermore critical care hospitals
 
07:37:15.350 --> 07:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
are already protected by a 15-m
 
07:37:15.360 --> 07:37:16.708 align:start position:0%

07:37:24.350 --> 07:37:24.360 align:start position:0%

07:37:27.150 --> 07:37:27.160 align:start position:0%

representative kerk thank you Mr
 
07:39:21.708 --> 07:39:21.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker yes currently licensed healthc
 
07:39:23.670 --> 07:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
care facilities are required to provide
 
07:39:25.910 --> 07:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
services to all persons regardless of
 
07:39:27.070 --> 07:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
the source of payment and that
 
07:39:29.990 --> 07:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
requirement was added in 2016 by the
 
07:39:32.830 --> 07:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
legislature to ensure access to services
 
07:39:34.708 --> 07:39:34.718 align:start position:0%
for low-income individuals and those
 
07:39:36.070 --> 07:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
07:39:39.190 --> 07:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid HB 1044 would exempt Healthcare
 
07:39:41.468 --> 07:39:41.478 align:start position:0%
facilities which exclusively provide
 
07:39:44.910 --> 07:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
services on a basis of direct payment
 
07:39:44.920 --> 07:39:45.910 align:start position:0%
services on a basis of direct payment
from

07:39:45.910 --> 07:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:39:48.910 --> 07:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
this uh from this uh requirement and
 
07:39:50.590 --> 07:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's without any reimbursement from a
 
07:39:53.308 --> 07:39:53.318 align:start position:0%
third party or any insurance and so it
 
07:39:54.788 --> 07:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
actually it's been build as something to
 
07:39:57.110 --> 07:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
help you with your high deductible but
 
07:39:58.548 --> 07:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
it really won't because that bill has to
 
07:40:00.868 --> 07:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
be sent through the insurance company in
 
07:40:03.030 --> 07:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
order to be credited to your
 
07:40:05.230 --> 07:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
deductible now such a change would allow
 
07:40:06.868 --> 07:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
a small number of for-profit
 
07:40:09.388 --> 07:40:09.398 align:start position:0%
Institutions offering Urgent Care
 
07:40:12.430 --> 07:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
birthing Services Ambulatory Surgery or
 
07:40:16.230 --> 07:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
other services to skim off the high
 
07:40:18.110 --> 07:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
paying patients who can pay the full
 
07:40:20.910 --> 07:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
cash price and that changes the payer
 
07:40:23.910 --> 07:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
mix for remaining hospitals and that 15
 
07:40:25.430 --> 07:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
Mile exclusion doesn't make much a
 
07:40:27.670 --> 07:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
difference I live 15 miles from any
 
07:40:28.868 --> 07:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
healthc Care
 
07:40:31.468 --> 07:40:31.478 align:start position:0%
Facility maintaining the payer mix is
 
07:40:34.510 --> 07:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
important for those remaining hospitals
 
07:40:36.868 --> 07:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals run on
 
07:40:40.070 --> 07:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
razor thin margins and they lose money
 
07:40:42.270 --> 07:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
on services such as the full service
 
07:40:45.350 --> 07:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
24hour per day emergency room and
 
07:40:47.868 --> 07:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
obstetrical services which serve many
 
07:40:51.270 --> 07:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
people on Medicaid or with no
 
07:40:53.990 --> 07:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
insurance those Services which are
 
07:40:56.910 --> 07:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
critical to have in rural areas are
 
07:40:59.590 --> 07:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the higher paying services
 
07:41:01.910 --> 07:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the higher paying insurances
 
07:41:03.670 --> 07:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
skimming off the higher paying patients
 
07:41:05.030 --> 07:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
would have a significant negative
 
07:41:07.190 --> 07:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
economic effect on our critical access
 
07:41:09.430 --> 07:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals there will be a substantial
 
07:41:11.948 --> 07:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
risk of Hospital closure or the need to
 
07:41:14.430 --> 07:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
drop CR clinical critical Clinical
 
07:41:17.230 --> 07:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
Services such as maternity and we've
 
07:41:19.708 --> 07:41:19.718 align:start position:0%
seen that happen leaving large numbers
 
07:41:22.230 --> 07:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
of individuals especially in rural areas
 
07:41:25.150 --> 07:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
with no access for timely medical care
 
07:41:28.190 --> 07:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
for emergencies or for child
 
07:41:30.708 --> 07:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
birth and the losses sustained by those
 
07:41:32.270 --> 07:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
facilities will be shifted to those who
 
07:41:34.910 --> 07:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
have insurance driving up the cost for
 
07:41:37.948 --> 07:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
everyone else and not changing that
 
07:41:40.110 --> 07:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
total health care
 
07:41:42.910 --> 07:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
costs the hospitals recognize the threat
 
07:41:44.948 --> 07:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
of this build to the existence of our
 
07:41:47.788 --> 07:41:47.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals and the need of all the
 
07:41:51.110 --> 07:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals to share the burdens equally
 
07:41:52.708 --> 07:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Hospital Association
 
07:41:55.030 --> 07:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
testified against this bill stating that
 
07:41:58.628 --> 07:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
it will not benefit patients access nor
 
07:42:00.190 --> 07:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
will it improve
 
07:42:03.308 --> 07:42:03.318 align:start position:0%
competition the majority believes that
 
07:42:05.510 --> 07:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
this bill will decrease access to health
 
07:42:08.708 --> 07:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
care and will not drive down the overall
 
07:42:09.990 --> 07:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
cost of Health
 
07:42:12.190 --> 07:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
Care I also find it interesting that the
 
07:42:14.948 --> 07:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
minority has said that this helps the
 
07:42:16.830 --> 07:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
free market but it's interesting because
 
07:42:19.670 --> 07:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
it only makes this EX exemption for
 
07:42:22.150 --> 07:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
certain business models that's not the
 
07:42:23.788 --> 07:42:23.798 align:start position:0%
free market the free market would not
 
07:42:26.510 --> 07:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
say this group is Exempted from this
 
07:42:28.868 --> 07:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
requirement but this group is not that
 
07:42:30.150 --> 07:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
isn't the free
 
07:42:32.230 --> 07:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
market so I would like you to please

in thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
07:43:34.628 --> 07:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
know that our current medical system is
 
07:43:37.468 --> 07:43:37.478 align:start position:0%
broken and patient satisfaction is at an
 
07:43:40.670 --> 07:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
all-time low and if I know that we need
 
07:43:43.150 --> 07:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
alternative options for consumers and
 
07:43:46.510 --> 07:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers and further if I know
 
07:43:48.548 --> 07:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
that competition and open market Market
 
07:43:50.548 --> 07:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
promote the best service at the best
 
07:43:53.708 --> 07:43:53.718 align:start position:0%

07:43:58.948 --> 07:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
made chair recognize the representative
 
07:44:01.308 --> 07:44:01.318 align:start position:0%
kerk for parliamentary inquiry thank you
 
07:44:02.708 --> 07:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
Mr speaker so if I know that our
 
07:44:04.628 --> 07:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals run on Raisor
 
07:44:06.510 --> 07:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
thin margins and they require a payer
 
07:44:08.388 --> 07:44:08.398 align:start position:0%
mix that includes private pay in order
 
07:44:11.910 --> 07:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
to maintain the revenue losing services
 
07:44:14.628 --> 07:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
such as 24-hour full service OB
 
07:44:17.070 --> 07:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms and abstral services
 
07:44:18.468 --> 07:44:18.478 align:start position:0%
which are critical particular in our
 
07:44:21.270 --> 07:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
rural areas and if I know that skimming
 
07:44:22.948 --> 07:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
off those higher paying patients would
 
07:44:24.868 --> 07:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
have a significant negative economic
 
07:44:27.830 --> 07:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
impact on our critical access hospitals
 
07:44:30.708 --> 07:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
leading to closures of obstetrical
 
07:44:33.430 --> 07:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
services and of critical access
 
07:44:35.628 --> 07:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
hospitals which are needed to provide
 
07:44:38.910 --> 07:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
timely care in our rural areas and if I
 
07:44:41.110 --> 07:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
know that this bill will decrease access
 
07:44:43.308 --> 07:44:43.318 align:start position:0%
to health care and will not drive down
 
07:44:45.948 --> 07:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
the cost of health care and if I know
 
07:44:49.270 --> 07:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill is actually thinly veiled
 
07:44:51.548 --> 07:44:51.558 align:start position:0%
protectionism for facilities that use
 
07:44:54.430 --> 07:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
just one business model would I then

07:49:30.308 --> 07:49:30.318 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker if I know what I've
 
07:49:32.110 --> 07:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
already said about the fact that this is
 
07:49:33.830 --> 07:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
going to be harmful to our critical
 
07:49:37.030 --> 07:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
access hospitals and well it is true
 
07:49:41.308 --> 07:49:41.318 align:start position:0%
that they did survive prior to this uh
 
07:49:43.590 --> 07:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
requirement in 2016 it's important to
 
07:49:45.070 --> 07:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
know and if any of you have been dealing
 
07:49:47.110 --> 07:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
with your hospitals you know that their
 
07:49:49.350 --> 07:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
survival is rather tenuous and a lot of
 
07:49:52.230 --> 07:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals have closed and if I know that
 
07:49:53.948 --> 07:49:53.958 align:start position:0%
skipping off these higher pay patients
 
07:49:55.110 --> 07:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
07:49:57.388 --> 07:49:57.398 align:start position:0%
problem and that this bill again is a
 
07:50:00.468 --> 07:50:00.478 align:start position:0%
protectionist bill for a small business
 
07:50:02.708 --> 07:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
model and will harm others because
 
07:50:04.708 --> 07:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
they're not subjected to the
 
07:50:08.270 --> 07:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
same uh suspension then I would would I
 
07:50:10.948 --> 07:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
then vote Yes to table this and not go
 
07:50:10.958 --> 07:50:15.150 align:start position:0%
then vote Yes to table this and not go
any

07:50:15.150 --> 07:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:17.070 --> 07:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
further do I recognize the
 
07:50:19.548 --> 07:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
representative L on for a parliamentary
 
07:50:21.868 --> 07:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
07:50:24.430 --> 07:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I believe it's wrong to hold
 
07:50:26.830 --> 07:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
some patients captive just so that we
 
07:50:28.708 --> 07:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
can have a certain patient
 
07:50:31.868 --> 07:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
mix and if I believe some patients want
 
07:50:33.750 --> 07:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
more than the allotted time from the
 
07:50:35.350 --> 07:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
insurance companies so that they can
 
07:50:37.270 --> 07:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
more thoroughly discuss their treatment
 
07:50:38.990 --> 07:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
options with their patient with their
 
07:50:42.350 --> 07:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
doctor and come to a decision where they
 
07:50:44.910 --> 07:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
are as the payer are the one in charge
 
07:50:46.948 --> 07:50:46.958 align:start position:0%

report thank you Mr
 
08:02:47.190 --> 08:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker what this bill
 
08:02:50.628 --> 08:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
does is it protects those who do not
 
08:02:53.948 --> 08:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
want to participate in abortions or
 
08:02:56.830 --> 08:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
sterilization or artificial
 
08:02:59.708 --> 08:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
contraception from any discrimination in
 
08:03:02.868 --> 08:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
the workplace based on that
 
08:03:05.708 --> 08:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
decision it's titled the rights of
 
08:03:08.788 --> 08:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
conscience for medical
 
08:03:08.798 --> 08:03:10.548 align:start position:0%
conscience for medical
professionals

08:03:10.548 --> 08:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
08:03:13.388 --> 08:03:13.398 align:start position:0%
now I believe the rights of conscience
 
08:03:15.468 --> 08:03:15.478 align:start position:0%
should apply to all
 
08:03:15.478 --> 08:03:17.948 align:start position:0%
should apply to all
people

08:03:17.948 --> 08:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
people
 
08:03:22.070 --> 08:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
first in this case doctors and nurse
 
08:03:25.110 --> 08:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
practitioners already have protection of
 
08:03:29.150 --> 08:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
the AMA code of methodical ethics and
 
08:03:29.160 --> 08:03:30.750 align:start position:0%
the AMA code of methodical ethics and
most

08:03:30.750 --> 08:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
most
 
08:03:34.468 --> 08:03:34.478 align:start position:0%
employers make accommodation for those
 
08:03:39.590 --> 08:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:39.600 --> 08:03:42.388 align:start position:0%
 
procedures

08:03:42.388 --> 08:03:42.398 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
08:03:44.590 --> 08:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
secondly which means that for those
 
08:03:47.750 --> 08:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
medical professionals the bill is not
 
08:03:50.468 --> 08:03:50.478 align:start position:0%
needed secondly let's look at the terms
 
08:03:52.270 --> 08:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
08:03:54.948 --> 08:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
bill the definition of medical
 
08:03:57.190 --> 08:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
professional is so
 
08:04:02.868 --> 08:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
broad that it includes those who are
 
08:04:06.110 --> 08:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
Manning the reception desk and those who
 
08:04:09.430 --> 08:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
clean the floor of a surgical Suite it's
 
08:04:13.110 --> 08:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
basically everyone who works in any kind
 
08:04:15.350 --> 08:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
of medical
 
08:04:15.360 --> 08:04:19.388 align:start position:0%
of medical
establishment

08:04:19.388 --> 08:04:19.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:22.190 --> 08:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
the definition is so broad that someone
 
08:04:24.590 --> 08:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
who wanted to act
 
08:04:27.030 --> 08:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
maliciously could seek
 
08:04:30.430 --> 08:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
employment at a reproductive Health Care
 
08:04:32.270 --> 08:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
Center and
 
08:04:35.388 --> 08:04:35.398 align:start position:0%
then be hired and then assert their
 
08:04:36.910 --> 08:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
right of
 
08:04:40.350 --> 08:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
conscience and what would happen then
 
08:04:43.590 --> 08:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
well despite not doing the job for which
 
08:04:46.948 --> 08:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
they were hired they could not be
 
08:04:50.190 --> 08:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
terminated because the bill says that
 
08:04:53.868 --> 08:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
termination constitutes
 
08:04:58.070 --> 08:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination and what happens if you
 
08:05:01.548 --> 08:05:01.558 align:start position:0%
discriminate the bill creates a new
 
08:05:05.590 --> 08:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
right of civil action and the recovery
 
08:05:08.990 --> 08:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
against the health care center would be
 
08:05:10.830 --> 08:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
a minimum of
 
08:05:13.670 --> 08:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
$10,000 plus
 
08:05:16.830 --> 08:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
costs even if
 
08:05:16.840 --> 08:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
costs even if
the

08:05:17.750 --> 08:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:05:20.110 --> 08:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
employee was
 
08:05:26.628 --> 08:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:29.830 --> 08:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
wrongly that's a lot of burden on what
 
08:05:33.708 --> 08:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:36.150 --> 08:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
businesses but here's the part that I
 
08:05:38.990 --> 08:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
particularly object to in this
 
08:05:44.190 --> 08:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
bill all persons should have a right to
 
08:05:47.308 --> 08:05:47.318 align:start position:0%
act in accordance with their cons
 
08:05:50.910 --> 08:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that's difficult people
 
08:05:54.670 --> 08:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
have lost their jobs over it and people
 
08:06:00.750 --> 08:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:05.270 --> 08:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:09.430 --> 08:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
easy and in this case what we are doing
 
08:06:13.788 --> 08:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
is on the oneand we are affording an
 
08:06:18.548 --> 08:06:18.558 align:start position:0%
absolute guaranteed clear easy
 
08:06:23.708 --> 08:06:23.718 align:start position:0%
way for people who believe in one course
 
08:06:26.628 --> 08:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
of action to act in accordance with
 
08:06:26.638 --> 08:06:27.430 align:start position:0%
of action to act in accordance with
their

08:06:27.430 --> 08:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
08:06:30.230 --> 08:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
conscience they're
 
08:06:32.830 --> 08:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
protected people who
 
08:06:36.548 --> 08:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
believe that as a medical professional
 
08:06:38.230 --> 08:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
as an active
 
08:06:43.270 --> 08:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
conscience they must help a woman who is
 
08:06:48.308 --> 08:06:48.318 align:start position:0%
past 24 weeks of a problem pregnancy who
 
08:06:51.110 --> 08:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
is making the most difficult decision
 
08:06:53.990 --> 08:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
she will ever make in her life with the
 
08:06:56.910 --> 08:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
help of her family and her medical
 
08:06:59.190 --> 08:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
professionals those medical
 
08:07:02.750 --> 08:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
professionals are currently legally
 
08:07:06.510 --> 08:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
forbidden for acting in accordance with
 
08:07:06.520 --> 08:07:08.788 align:start position:0%
forbidden for acting in accordance with
their

08:07:08.788 --> 08:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
their
 
08:07:12.670 --> 08:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
conscience so on the one hand we have
 
08:07:15.110 --> 08:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
people whose consciences are
 
08:07:18.548 --> 08:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
protected and on the other hand we have
 
08:07:19.990 --> 08:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
peoples whose
 
08:07:22.670 --> 08:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
consciences have a legal
 
08:07:28.708 --> 08:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:32.590 --> 08:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
wrong I ask you to press the red button
 
08:07:40.308 --> 08:07:40.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:42.910 --> 08:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
made representative Mark Pearson has
 
08:07:44.990 --> 08:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call we're down to our
 
08:07:49.270 --> 08:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:51.788 --> 08:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
08:07:53.910 --> 08:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote
 
08:07:56.110 --> 08:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
members take your seats we're down to
 
08:07:57.350 --> 08:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
the last
 
08:08:03.468 --> 08:08:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:06.708 --> 08:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you Mr
 
08:08:09.868 --> 08:08:09.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker conscience is a precious
 
08:08:13.110 --> 08:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
thing I think most of us have seen the
 
08:08:15.430 --> 08:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
documentaries about the Unspeakable
 
08:08:17.750 --> 08:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
things that doctors and their staffs
 
08:08:21.270 --> 08:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
were for forced to do in Nazi
 
08:08:23.510 --> 08:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
Germany and yet one hears that in
 
08:08:25.708 --> 08:08:25.718 align:start position:0%
numbers of States medical people are
 
08:08:28.628 --> 08:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
forced to participate in a procedure
 
08:08:31.590 --> 08:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
that as they and I understand it is the
 
08:08:34.230 --> 08:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
taking of an innocent human
 
08:08:36.830 --> 08:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
life there are numerous places where
 
08:08:39.350 --> 08:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
abortion is practiced but as a small
 
08:08:42.308 --> 08:08:42.318 align:start position:0%
portion of what is being done this bill
 
08:08:44.548 --> 08:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
would allow persons of conscience in
 
08:08:46.990 --> 08:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
this matter to keep keep their jobs
 
08:08:49.910 --> 08:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
there not disrupting the facility while
 
08:08:54.590 --> 08:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:59.670 --> 08:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:02.868 --> 08:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
heard member may continue thank you Mr
 
08:09:05.230 --> 08:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill would allow persons of
 
08:09:07.948 --> 08:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
conscience in this matter to keep their
 
08:09:10.750 --> 08:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
jobs while allowing others to stand in
 
08:09:13.510 --> 08:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
for them in those procedures
 
08:09:16.708 --> 08:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
only I've heard several objections to
 
08:09:20.590 --> 08:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
this bill first these protections are
 
08:09:22.510 --> 08:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
already there in
 
08:09:24.948 --> 08:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
law if that's the case then no one has
 
08:09:27.788 --> 08:09:27.798 align:start position:0%
anything to fear for us making it a bit
 
08:09:30.230 --> 08:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
more explicit do they we're not adding
 
08:09:32.308 --> 08:09:32.318 align:start position:0%
anything we're just making these
 
08:09:34.590 --> 08:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
protections that were told are already
 
08:09:37.350 --> 08:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
there in the law just a little bit more
 
08:09:40.150 --> 08:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
explicit it's an abundance of caution a
 
08:09:41.868 --> 08:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
phrase we've all been
 
08:09:44.990 --> 08:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
using second we've been told no medical
 
08:09:46.590 --> 08:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
professional in the New Hampshire has
 
08:09:50.708 --> 08:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
ever been put in job risk for that you
 
08:09:54.308 --> 08:09:54.318 align:start position:0%
have not spoken to the people I have
 
08:09:57.548 --> 08:09:57.558 align:start position:0%
next during the hearing I was asked as
 
08:09:59.788 --> 08:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of this bill would I be
 
08:10:02.628 --> 08:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
willing to include other medical
 
08:10:05.548 --> 08:10:05.558 align:start position:0%
procedures and other kinds of
 
08:10:07.948 --> 08:10:07.958 align:start position:0%
professions thank you to my colleagues
 
08:10:10.750 --> 08:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
across the aisle for bringing that up my
 
08:10:12.990 --> 08:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
response is over the summer I should be
 
08:10:15.830 --> 08:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
happy to work with my colleagues in my
 
08:10:18.190 --> 08:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
committee who posed these questions so
 
08:10:21.190 --> 08:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
we can file some bipartisan
 
08:10:21.200 --> 08:10:23.030 align:start position:0%
we can file some bipartisan
lsrs

08:10:23.030 --> 08:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
lsrs
 
08:10:26.830 --> 08:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
fourth this bill is signed into law the
 
08:10:26.840 --> 08:10:28.430 align:start position:0%
fourth this bill is signed into law the
objections

08:10:28.430 --> 08:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
objections
 
08:10:31.190 --> 08:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
say would lead to a reduction in the
 
08:10:34.030 --> 08:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
number of capable medical people coming
 
08:10:36.750 --> 08:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
to work here in New Hampshire and thus
 
08:10:40.030 --> 08:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
our quality of care would suffer we
 
08:10:43.190 --> 08:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
should discount such fear mongering the
 
08:10:45.868 --> 08:10:45.878 align:start position:0%
fact is for many years Massachusetts had
 
08:10:48.110 --> 08:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
a build just like this actually with
 
08:10:51.308 --> 08:10:51.318 align:start position:0%
tougher penalties and yet continued to
 
08:10:54.350 --> 08:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
draw good people to practice medicine
 
08:10:57.230 --> 08:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
and was consistently rated as having one
 
08:10:58.788 --> 08:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
of high
 
08:11:01.350 --> 08:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
quality I've discovered that states with
 
08:11:04.308 --> 08:11:04.318 align:start position:0%
laws like the one proposed here have
 
08:11:06.670 --> 08:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
drawn many quite capable pro-life
 
08:11:09.788 --> 08:11:09.798 align:start position:0%
medical staff maybe even we would get
 
08:11:13.830 --> 08:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
better for allowing such conscience
 
08:11:16.628 --> 08:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
here and finally it was was suggested
 
08:11:19.110 --> 08:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
that an individual might join the staff
 
08:11:22.270 --> 08:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
of a facility where abortion is the main
 
08:11:25.190 --> 08:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
procedure performed and then once there
 
08:11:27.948 --> 08:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
start asserting rights of
 
08:11:30.628 --> 08:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
conscience it does not take much mental
 
08:11:33.270 --> 08:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
acuity to know that no pro-life person
 
08:11:36.388 --> 08:11:36.398 align:start position:0%
would choose to work at such a
 
08:11:40.868 --> 08:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
place I close with a quote about Nazi
 
08:11:43.948 --> 08:11:43.958 align:start position:0%
Germany made by Martin Neer a German
 
08:11:46.830 --> 08:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
Lutheran pastor about how people of
 
08:11:49.750 --> 08:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
conscience have to stand up for each
 
08:11:52.868 --> 08:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
other even if their issues
 
08:11:55.110 --> 08:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
differ these are the words that are
 
08:11:58.628 --> 08:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
found on the US Holocaust
 
08:12:02.708 --> 08:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
Memorial first they meaning Nazis came
 
08:12:05.030 --> 08:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
for the Communists and I did not speak
 
08:12:07.350 --> 08:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
out because I was not a
 
08:12:09.750 --> 08:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
communist then they came for the trade
 
08:12:12.070 --> 08:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
unionists and I did not speak out
 
08:12:14.230 --> 08:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
because I was not a trade
 
08:12:17.788 --> 08:12:17.798 align:start position:0%
unionist then they came for the Jews and
 
08:12:21.190 --> 08:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
I did not speak out because I was not a
 
08:12:25.468 --> 08:12:25.478 align:start position:0%
Jew then they came for me and there was
 
08:12:28.830 --> 08:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
no one left to speak for me the member
 
08:12:32.510 --> 08:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:37.468 --> 08:12:37.478 align:start position:0%
minute I think I think the testimony is
 
08:12:42.230 --> 08:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit off base if we
 
08:12:45.270 --> 08:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
could bring it back to the bill itself
 
08:12:52.430 --> 08:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:55.030 --> 08:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
people of conscience Mr Speaker need to
 
08:12:57.230 --> 08:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
stand together and I ask people to stand
 
08:13:00.110 --> 08:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
with me on this because there may well
 
08:13:02.270 --> 08:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
be a time next time when I'm being asked
 
08:13:10.788 --> 08:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:13:14.308 --> 08:13:14.318 align:start position:0%
Speaker the motion before us is the
 
08:13:17.590 --> 08:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
ought to P majority report of a to
 
08:13:20.388 --> 08:13:20.398 align:start position:0%
pass this is a roll call vote members
 
08:13:44.468 --> 08:13:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:13:44.478 --> 08:14:13.750 align:start position:0%

that rights ought to be
 
08:14:39.990 --> 08:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
reciprocal and I know that to favor the

rights of conscience of one group of
 
08:14:45.990 --> 08:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
people over the rights of conscience of

nurse or other health care professional

has very little say in what procedures
 
08:15:14.030 --> 08:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
they participate in and no law to site
 
08:15:16.070 --> 08:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
today if they're asked has to violate
 
08:15:18.190 --> 08:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
their conscience by terminating what
 
08:15:20.750 --> 08:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
they believe to be an innocent life and
 
08:15:22.788 --> 08:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
if I know that potential care providers
 
08:15:25.228 --> 08:15:25.238 align:start position:0%
decide early when they decide to take
 
08:15:28.270 --> 08:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
Premed classes or not what path they're
 
08:15:30.830 --> 08:15:30.840 align:start position:0%

08:15:34.190 --> 08:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
many future nurses doctors and other
 
08:15:36.990 --> 08:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals don't enter
 
08:15:39.228 --> 08:15:39.238 align:start position:0%
this profession because they're afraid
 
08:15:40.750 --> 08:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
that they may have to violate their
 
08:15:42.350 --> 08:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
conscience in this
 
08:15:46.350 --> 08:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
way and if I know if those tasks to do
 
08:15:49.590 --> 08:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
no harm should not have to undergo harm
 
08:15:52.430 --> 08:15:52.440 align:start position:0%

Mark Pearson to speak against the
amendment

08:24:16.190 --> 08:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
08:24:18.228 --> 08:24:18.238 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker when this amendment
 
08:24:21.350 --> 08:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
was first crafted it represented
 
08:24:25.150 --> 08:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we had having spoken to
 
08:24:25.160 --> 08:24:26.910 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we had having spoken to
Correctional

08:24:26.910 --> 08:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
Correctional
 
08:24:29.830 --> 08:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
officials and since then however we have
 
08:24:31.948 --> 08:24:31.958 align:start position:0%
learned that in a few places around the
 
08:24:33.990 --> 08:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
country certain laws have been put in
 
08:24:36.030 --> 08:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
place and with that has come the kind of
 
08:24:37.868 --> 08:24:37.878 align:start position:0%
problems that occur when fixed laws
 
08:24:40.788 --> 08:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
replace flexible policies we want to
 
08:24:42.150 --> 08:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
preserve what we have now in New
 
08:24:43.788 --> 08:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with our flexibility because
 
08:24:47.228 --> 08:24:47.238 align:start position:0%
one-sized is not fit all inadvertently
 
08:24:50.110 --> 08:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment will weaken this we've
 
08:24:53.308 --> 08:24:53.318 align:start position:0%
just discovered this and so I am
 
08:24:58.110 --> 08:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
strongly suggesting we vote no on this
 
08:25:01.110 --> 08:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
amendment Z gold has requested R call is
 
08:25:04.948 --> 08:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:25:09.590 --> 08:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:25:12.628 --> 08:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
seconded this will be a division vote
 
08:25:43.388 --> 08:25:43.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:25:43.398 --> 08:26:05.270 align:start position:0%

08:26:05.270 --> 08:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:26:08.270 --> 08:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the adoption
 
08:26:11.510 --> 08:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the amendment 0959
 
08:26:15.030 --> 08:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
H this is a division vote the chair

08:26:35.190 --> 08:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Speaker and pardon me
 
08:26:39.548 --> 08:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
for the confusion um once again my Pi is
 
08:26:43.510 --> 08:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
if I know that the amendment when we
 
08:26:46.030 --> 08:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
first put it together was brilliant and
 
08:26:48.708 --> 08:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
if I know subsequent knowledge that has
 
08:26:51.590 --> 08:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
come to us have said that this could be
 
08:26:54.628 --> 08:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
counterproductive I would would I not
 
08:26:56.868 --> 08:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
press the red button against the
 
08:26:59.430 --> 08:26:59.440 align:start position:0%

08:27:13.150 --> 08:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is to protect women's
 
08:27:16.070 --> 08:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
sports and and if I know this bill
 
08:27:18.308 --> 08:27:18.318 align:start position:0%
without the amendment could allow
 
08:27:21.548 --> 08:27:21.558 align:start position:0%
carding or blocking trans people from
 
08:27:21.558 --> 08:27:22.868 align:start position:0%

without the amendment could also
 
08:27:30.670 --> 08:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
complicate the job of New Hampshire
 
08:27:33.388 --> 08:27:33.398 align:start position:0%
Corrections who already must follow

elimination Act of 2003
 
08:27:48.670 --> 08:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
are priia as they call it and if I know
 
08:27:51.150 --> 08:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
that women and girls participating in
 
08:27:55.228 --> 08:27:55.238 align:start position:0%
sports with trans women teens and adults
 
08:27:58.308 --> 08:27:58.318 align:start position:0%
deserve to compete against people whose
 
08:28:01.708 --> 08:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
an transition started before they
 
08:28:05.388 --> 08:28:05.398 align:start position:0%

08:30:59.150 --> 08:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
they're coming for me so this bill is
 
08:31:01.190 --> 08:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
all about discrimination plain and
 
08:31:05.030 --> 08:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
simple the few transgender children who
 
08:31:08.070 --> 08:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
participate in sports vary an athletic
 
08:31:11.030 --> 08:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
ability size shape and as much as other
 
08:31:15.308 --> 08:31:15.318 align:start position:0%
youth do some you youth have outstanding
 
08:31:18.708 --> 08:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
athletic ability some not so
 
08:31:21.708 --> 08:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
much gender identity shouldn't play a
 
08:31:24.308 --> 08:31:24.318 align:start position:0%
role in the opportunities that we give
 
08:31:26.430 --> 08:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
students in all activities and courses
 
08:31:30.150 --> 08:31:30.160 align:start position:0%

08:31:32.788 --> 08:31:32.798 align:start position:0%

the state has concluded that it would be
 
08:32:00.350 --> 08:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
fundamentally unjust and contrary to
 
08:32:03.548 --> 08:32:03.558 align:start position:0%
applicable state and federal laws to

08:32:10.830 --> 08:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
a gender specific sports team that is
 
08:32:13.228 --> 08:32:13.238 align:start position:0%
consistent with the public gender

Community local schools are charged with
 
08:32:25.548 --> 08:32:25.558 align:start position:0%
verifying that the school district has
 
08:32:27.190 --> 08:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
determined that the expression of the
 
08:32:31.270 --> 08:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
student's gender identity is Bonafide
 
08:32:33.190 --> 08:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
and not for the purpose of gaining an
 
08:32:35.590 --> 08:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
unfair advantage in competitive
 
08:32:39.228 --> 08:32:39.238 align:start position:0%
Sports if you think a high school boy
 
08:32:41.228 --> 08:32:41.238 align:start position:0%
would put on suddenly put on a skirt and
 
08:32:44.628 --> 08:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
try out for a girls team um it doesn't
 
08:32:46.350 --> 08:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
just doesn't happen in high school I
 
08:32:48.670 --> 08:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
taught in high school for 30
 
08:32:52.270 --> 08:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
years School sports at all levels should
 
08:32:56.110 --> 08:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
be centered on inclusion education and
 
08:32:58.308 --> 08:32:58.318 align:start position:0%
participation there's ample evidence
 
08:33:00.430 --> 08:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
that an opportunity for adolesence to
 
08:33:02.948 --> 08:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
participate in sports results in
 
08:33:05.670 --> 08:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes such as better grades
 
08:33:08.070 --> 08:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
better work in class
 
08:33:10.510 --> 08:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
self-discipline higher educational and
 
08:33:14.548 --> 08:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
occupational aspirations and improved
 
08:33:16.948 --> 08:33:16.958 align:start position:0%
self-esteem youth learn a lot of lessons
 
08:33:19.868 --> 08:33:19.878 align:start position:0%
in sports I coach for many years they
 
08:33:22.190 --> 08:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
learn to get better to have a role on a
 
08:33:25.708 --> 08:33:25.718 align:start position:0%
team they learn sportsmanship leadership
 
08:33:28.228 --> 08:33:28.238 align:start position:0%
hard work and they learn to be gracious
 
08:33:28.238 --> 08:33:29.110 align:start position:0%
hard work and they learn to be gracious
in

08:33:29.110 --> 08:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
08:33:32.228 --> 08:33:32.238 align:start position:0%
winning and to be resilient in the face
 
08:33:34.670 --> 08:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
of defeat which some of us could take a
 
08:33:38.150 --> 08:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
little lesson on um this is all
 
08:33:41.270 --> 08:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination okay it's not about
 
08:33:44.388 --> 08:33:44.398 align:start position:0%
safety issue um I taught for long time
 
08:33:47.070 --> 08:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
co-ed High School physical education and
 
08:33:50.150 --> 08:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years I had no concerns with
 
08:33:54.070 --> 08:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
safety it's not about co-ed competition
 
08:33:57.590 --> 08:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
we had co-ed competition in in classes
 
08:33:59.990 --> 08:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
and um there were as many girls that did
 
08:34:03.708 --> 08:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
well as boys it's not about fairness
 
08:34:05.388 --> 08:34:05.398 align:start position:0%
which is an elusive term when your
 
08:34:08.548 --> 08:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
tallest basketball player on my team was
 
08:34:11.150 --> 08:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
5'4 and the other team had a 6 foot
 
08:34:13.708 --> 08:34:13.718 align:start position:0%
center because there will be differences
 
08:34:17.070 --> 08:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
and not related to gender identity it's
 
08:34:19.948 --> 08:34:19.958 align:start position:0%
not about winning and losing because
 
08:34:22.228 --> 08:34:22.238 align:start position:0%
eventually you meet some team or person
 
08:34:24.190 --> 08:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
who will be better than you worked
 
08:34:26.910 --> 08:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
harder or just had a lucky
 
08:34:30.670 --> 08:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
day um NCAA and the Olympic Committee
 
08:34:33.468 --> 08:34:33.478 align:start position:0%
where competition is a little bit higher
 
08:34:36.590 --> 08:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
have other rules and regulations but um
 
08:34:39.670 --> 08:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
they also let transgender people
 
08:34:41.868 --> 08:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
identify and play in
 
08:34:44.110 --> 08:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
sports um as
 
08:34:46.350 --> 08:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
so this bill is giving permission to
 
08:34:48.910 --> 08:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
schools and governmental agencies this
 
08:34:51.910 --> 08:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
bill to deny a young person the ability
 
08:34:54.468 --> 08:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
to participate based on their gender
 
08:34:57.670 --> 08:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
identity their authentic self who they
 
08:35:01.110 --> 08:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
think they are how they feel and that is
 
08:35:04.510 --> 08:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
wrong to deny that as a country as New
 
08:35:07.670 --> 08:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have made our
 
08:35:11.510 --> 08:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
non-discriminant law laws a statement
 
08:35:14.590 --> 08:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
that how New Hampshire treats people in
 
08:35:17.308 --> 08:35:17.318 align:start position:0%
protected classes and transgender people
 
08:35:20.948 --> 08:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
are in a protected class I believe that
 
08:35:23.388 --> 08:35:23.398 align:start position:0%
discrimination is wrong and that
 
08:35:25.468 --> 08:35:25.478 align:start position:0%
everybody should have the ability to
 
08:35:28.468 --> 08:35:28.478 align:start position:0%
succeed in our public schools and life
 
08:35:33.430 --> 08:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:40.948 --> 08:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:44.388 --> 08:35:44.398 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr Speaker we had an
 
08:35:47.030 --> 08:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that took away 2/3 of a very
 
08:35:50.350 --> 08:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
bad Bill but that failed so I'll tell
 
08:35:52.750 --> 08:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
you about the 2/3 of the very bad Bill
 
08:35:52.760 --> 08:35:54.708 align:start position:0%
you about the 2/3 of the very bad Bill
that

08:35:54.708 --> 08:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:35:58.910 --> 08:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
remain one of the things that one of the
 
08:36:02.070 --> 08:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
areas that people would be allowed to
 
08:36:04.270 --> 08:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
assign people only to their biological
 
08:36:07.070 --> 08:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
sex if they chose to do that is in the
 
08:36:07.080 --> 08:36:08.228 align:start position:0%
sex if they chose to do that is in the
prison

08:36:08.228 --> 08:36:08.238 align:start position:0%
prison
 
08:36:11.628 --> 08:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
system and the rationale for that
 
08:36:14.628 --> 08:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
was uh trans
 
08:36:17.510 --> 08:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
transgender women who had not completed
 
08:36:20.590 --> 08:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
their transition being in prison with
 
08:36:23.868 --> 08:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
females so here's the
 
08:36:27.308 --> 08:36:27.318 align:start position:0%
problem what we should be doing for our
 
08:36:30.308 --> 08:36:30.318 align:start position:0%
prison population is making sure that
 
08:36:36.070 --> 08:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely everyone is safe every single
 
08:36:39.548 --> 08:36:39.558 align:start position:0%
prisoner we know that because we just
 
08:36:41.388 --> 08:36:41.398 align:start position:0%
had the bill about the youth development
 
08:36:44.990 --> 08:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
center we need to keep everybody be safe
 
08:36:47.750 --> 08:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the way of doing that is not
 
08:36:50.110 --> 08:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
assigning somebody who is partway
 
08:36:52.750 --> 08:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
through a transition from male to female
 
08:36:54.548 --> 08:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
back to a male
 
08:36:56.948 --> 08:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
prison that's not
 
08:37:00.308 --> 08:37:00.318 align:start position:0%
safe the other thing is that it is not
 
08:37:03.670 --> 08:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
fair to put all the burden of
 
08:37:07.868 --> 08:37:07.878 align:start position:0%
safety on transgender people what we
 
08:37:10.990 --> 08:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing in the prisons is to
 
08:37:14.468 --> 08:37:14.478 align:start position:0%
ensure the safety of all the
 
08:37:17.430 --> 08:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
prisoners and that is being worked on
 
08:37:18.830 --> 08:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
with prison
 
08:37:18.840 --> 08:37:20.708 align:start position:0%
with prison
policies

08:37:20.708 --> 08:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
policies
 
08:37:24.548 --> 08:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
and their policies of how people are
 
08:37:28.430 --> 08:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
housed which takes into account and
 
08:37:31.670 --> 08:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
recognizes their gender identity without
 
08:37:35.388 --> 08:37:35.398 align:start position:0%
forcing them to relinquish
 
08:37:39.468 --> 08:37:39.478 align:start position:0%
it so that's we we had very strong
 
08:37:43.868 --> 08:37:43.878 align:start position:0%
language from uh both I believe somebody
 
08:37:45.628 --> 08:37:45.638 align:start position:0%
who is a superintendent of Corrections
 
08:37:47.548 --> 08:37:47.558 align:start position:0%
in one of the counties and also from the
 
08:37:49.228 --> 08:37:49.238 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections at the state
 
08:37:51.830 --> 08:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
level that this the provisions of this
 
08:37:53.350 --> 08:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
bill are going to make their lives
 
08:37:55.070 --> 08:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
infinitely more
 
08:37:58.070 --> 08:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
difficult so that's one thing the other
 
08:38:00.350 --> 08:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
section that's still in the
 
08:38:04.270 --> 08:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
bill is the inclusion of what was called
 
08:38:07.948 --> 08:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
areas of intimate
 
08:38:10.150 --> 08:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
privacy you know what that sounds like
 
08:38:13.868 --> 08:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
to me that sounds like a bathroom bill
 
08:38:16.150 --> 08:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
do you remember what happened in North
 
08:38:18.590 --> 08:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
Carolina when North Carolina passed a
 
08:38:23.150 --> 08:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
bathroom bill it wasn't pretty people
 
08:38:25.830 --> 08:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
actually pulled out athletic
 
08:38:27.708 --> 08:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
competitions and all kinds of other
 
08:38:30.868 --> 08:38:30.878 align:start position:0%
things because they had gone down that
 
08:38:33.468 --> 08:38:33.478 align:start position:0%
road and I know that people are going to
 
08:38:37.388 --> 08:38:37.398 align:start position:0%
tell me well this just permits people to
 
08:38:39.628 --> 08:38:39.638 align:start position:0%
do it it doesn't
 
08:38:43.548 --> 08:38:43.558 align:start position:0%
require but here's the rub with that if
 
08:38:46.350 --> 08:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
you permit people to
 
08:38:49.590 --> 08:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
discriminate in all three of these areas
 
08:38:53.750 --> 08:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
Sports prisons and places of intimate
 
08:38:59.070 --> 08:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
privacy then a transgender person who is
 
08:38:59.080 --> 08:39:01.150 align:start position:0%
privacy then a transgender person who is
assigned

08:39:01.150 --> 08:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
assigned
 
08:39:05.868 --> 08:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
unfairly to a place for their biological
 
08:39:10.830 --> 08:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
sex will no longer have the protections
 
08:39:10.840 --> 08:39:12.228 align:start position:0%
sex will no longer have the protections
against

08:39:12.228 --> 08:39:12.238 align:start position:0%
against
 
08:39:14.830 --> 08:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination that they now have
 
08:39:17.788 --> 08:39:17.798 align:start position:0%
because we just removed them in this
 
08:39:21.430 --> 08:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
bill and there will be no recourse for
 
08:39:25.350 --> 08:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
them so for those reasons because this
 
08:39:27.990 --> 08:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill is now back to its original and
 
08:39:30.150 --> 08:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
exceedingly flawed
 
08:39:35.228 --> 08:39:35.238 align:start position:0%
form I ask you to press the red button
 
08:39:37.670 --> 08:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
and itl so that another motion can be
 
08:39:41.468 --> 08:39:41.478 align:start position:0%
made thank you does member yield the
 
08:39:45.070 --> 08:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
questions no remember it does not
 
08:39:54.868 --> 08:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:07.070 --> 08:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:10.788 --> 08:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
Speaker so what is our purpose here are
 
08:40:12.110 --> 08:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
we putting in
 
08:40:14.670 --> 08:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
legislation to control a very small
 
08:40:18.150 --> 08:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:21.190 --> 08:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
population our transgender population
 
08:40:26.070 --> 08:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
for everyone is about onethird of
 
08:40:29.150 --> 08:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
1% of our entire
 
08:40:33.150 --> 08:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
population of that only about
 
08:40:36.270 --> 08:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
500 members are
 
08:40:39.190 --> 08:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
students most of those students are
 
08:40:40.788 --> 08:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
there to get an
 
08:40:43.708 --> 08:40:43.718 align:start position:0%
education very few of them are there to
 
08:40:45.670 --> 08:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
08:40:48.708 --> 08:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
sports and it's very rare when one of
 
08:40:48.718 --> 08:40:49.628 align:start position:0%
sports and it's very rare when one of
those

08:40:49.628 --> 08:40:49.638 align:start position:0%
those
 
08:40:54.590 --> 08:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:40:57.590 --> 08:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
superstar I understand we have a
 
08:41:01.228 --> 08:41:01.238 align:start position:0%
need to make Sports Fair between
 
08:41:01.238 --> 08:41:02.670 align:start position:0%
need to make Sports Fair between
transgender

08:41:02.670 --> 08:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
08:41:09.590 --> 08:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:41:12.030 --> 08:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
terminology our schools are aware of
 
08:41:12.040 --> 08:41:13.750 align:start position:0%
terminology our schools are aware of
this

08:41:13.750 --> 08:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
08:41:15.990 --> 08:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
the agencies the the athletic
 
08:41:19.788 --> 08:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
associations are aware of this the ioc
 
08:41:23.548 --> 08:41:23.558 align:start position:0%
and the NCAA are aware of this and
 
08:41:26.670 --> 08:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
they've been putting in place
 
08:41:30.590 --> 08:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
policies to help both the
 
08:41:33.830 --> 08:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
transgender girls and the trans and the
 
08:41:41.948 --> 08:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:41:41.958 --> 08:41:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
Sports

08:41:45.590 --> 08:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:41:48.430 --> 08:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
in the medical
 
08:41:50.708 --> 08:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
community they've
 
08:41:54.150 --> 08:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
identified medication that allows
 
08:41:56.910 --> 08:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
students it it allows people to block
 
08:42:01.468 --> 08:42:01.478 align:start position:0%
the hormones of students of young people
 
08:42:04.388 --> 08:42:04.398 align:start position:0%
from proceeding through
 
08:42:07.468 --> 08:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
puberty these transgender girls who who
 
08:42:10.590 --> 08:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
are taking these puberty blocking
 
08:42:14.270 --> 08:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
drugs grow at the same rate
 
08:42:16.150 --> 08:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
as their
 
08:42:18.110 --> 08:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
girlfriends in the
 
08:42:21.750 --> 08:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
community they don't grow to be the same
 
08:42:25.430 --> 08:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:42:29.510 --> 08:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
male most of these girls won't
 
08:42:32.830 --> 08:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
start estrogen therapy until they're 18
 
08:42:35.948 --> 08:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
years old up until that time they won't
 
08:42:38.868 --> 08:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
have testosterone in their system they
 
08:42:40.190 --> 08:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
08:42:45.150 --> 08:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:42:46.788 --> 08:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
and they won't have some of the impact
 
08:42:49.868 --> 08:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
as far as their skeletal strength and
 
08:42:56.468 --> 08:42:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:42:59.868 --> 08:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
boys there are a number of
 
08:43:02.750 --> 08:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
organizations that are defining what the
 
08:43:02.760 --> 08:43:04.228 align:start position:0%
organizations that are defining what the
policies

08:43:04.228 --> 08:43:04.238 align:start position:0%
policies
 
08:43:08.228 --> 08:43:08.238 align:start position:0%
are for transgender girls and
 
08:43:11.590 --> 08:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
sports first off in the school system
 
08:43:14.708 --> 08:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
the uh namp Schoolboard Association has
 
08:43:17.708 --> 08:43:17.718 align:start position:0%

one test a year and it's going to go
 
08:45:27.670 --> 08:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
next year to two tests a year so they're
 
08:45:29.548 --> 08:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
going to keep track
 
08:45:32.430 --> 08:45:32.440 align:start position:0%

in this bill that's been
 
08:46:05.070 --> 08:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
introduced is on the the bleeding edge

or the Leading Edge of what is already
 
08:46:12.350 --> 08:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
happening in in other places and it's if

we implement this
 
08:46:18.350 --> 08:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
bill it's ignoring that this work is

already being done in other areas and it
 
08:46:23.628 --> 08:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
may be more appropriate to be done by

other associations and organizations

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
09:56:59.106 --> 09:56:59.116 align:start position:0%
if I know that there is nothing in
 
09:57:01.670 --> 09:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
statute that currently prevents anything
 
09:57:04.746 --> 09:57:04.756 align:start position:0%
that this bill seeks to codify and if I
 
09:57:06.550 --> 09:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
know that we should not waste our time
 
09:57:08.830 --> 09:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
on unnecessary legislation that does
 
09:57:10.906 --> 09:57:10.916 align:start position:0%
nothing more than add new laws to the
 
09:57:14.150 --> 09:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
books with no purpose and if I know that
 
09:57:16.150 --> 09:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
Performing Arts venues have been setting
 
09:57:18.510 --> 09:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
their own covid policies this entire
 
09:57:20.710 --> 09:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
time I would now vote green to table
 
09:57:20.720 --> 09:57:22.030 align:start position:0%

this

09:57:22.030 --> 09:57:22.040 align:start position:0%

bill J recognizes representative kerk
 
09:57:26.586 --> 09:57:26.596 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary
 
09:57:30.470 --> 09:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
inur thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
09:57:33.350 --> 09:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
it is true that facilities of venues can
 
09:57:35.266 --> 09:57:35.276 align:start position:0%
do this but they have been challenged
 
09:57:37.150 --> 09:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
with people saying that you do not have
 
09:57:40.150 --> 09:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
the right to set your own protocols and
 
09:57:42.550 --> 09:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
them setting their own safety protocols
 
09:57:45.670 --> 09:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
for the safety of their patrons and for
 
09:57:48.586 --> 09:57:48.596 align:start position:0%
their employees is a business decision
 
09:57:50.790 --> 09:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
which they should be allowed to make on
 
09:57:53.790 --> 09:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
their own and if I know that if they do
 
09:57:55.790 --> 09:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
not honor the requests of the artist
 
09:57:57.426 --> 09:57:57.436 align:start position:0%
that artist can take their business to
 
09:57:59.906 --> 09:57:59.916 align:start position:0%
another venue perhaps across the border
 
09:58:01.990 --> 09:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
to a Southern state state just bordering
 
09:58:04.630 --> 09:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
us to the South and we lose that
 
09:58:06.790 --> 09:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
business and if I I know that many
 
09:58:08.670 --> 09:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
patients will feel much more comfortable
 
09:58:11.190 --> 09:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
to go into a setting if they do know
 
09:58:14.950 --> 09:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
that their safety is being respected and
 
09:58:16.746 --> 09:58:16.756 align:start position:0%
therefore it can be a marketing move in
 
09:58:18.266 --> 09:58:18.276 align:start position:0%
addition to their own Independent
 
09:58:20.710 --> 09:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
Business decision and if I know that
 
09:58:23.670 --> 09:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
what this bill does then is
 
09:58:26.830 --> 09:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
affirms affirms the fact that they do
 
09:58:29.390 --> 09:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
have the authority to set their own
 
09:58:33.870 --> 09:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
business policies with regard to various
 
09:58:35.426 --> 09:58:35.436 align:start position:0%
protocols for protection for
 
09:58:38.906 --> 09:58:38.916 align:start position:0%

kerk for a parliamentary
 
10:07:28.950 --> 10:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
10:07:31.830 --> 10:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill removes the authority of the
 
10:07:33.106 --> 10:07:33.116 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
10:07:35.950 --> 10:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
DHHS to be able to add
 
10:07:39.550 --> 10:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
by rule various immunizations that may
 
10:07:41.746 --> 10:07:41.756 align:start position:0%
be necessary to be
 
10:07:44.310 --> 10:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
done and that's done very rarely it's
 
10:07:46.426 --> 10:07:46.436 align:start position:0%
only been three over about 20 years and
 
10:07:49.030 --> 10:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
the last one was done in 2003 so it is
 
10:07:51.230 --> 10:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
not something that is done in a
 
10:07:52.906 --> 10:07:52.916 align:start position:0%
light-hearted fashion and if I know that
 
10:07:55.510 --> 10:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner doesn't do this on
 
10:07:57.426 --> 10:07:57.436 align:start position:0%
their own but instead they do it in
 
10:08:00.426 --> 10:08:00.436 align:start position:0%
consultation with the epidemiologist
 
10:08:03.106 --> 10:08:03.116 align:start position:0%
many other people and uh National
 
10:08:06.230 --> 10:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh would I then vote against
 
10:08:08.950 --> 10:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we could maintain the
 
10:08:11.550 --> 10:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
policy that we have had of having the
 
10:08:13.310 --> 10:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner have the flexibility to be
 
10:08:16.150 --> 10:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
able to respond to public health issues
 
10:08:18.070 --> 10:08:18.080 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know that today childhood
 
10:08:29.470 --> 10:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
immunizations are split between laws and
 
10:08:32.510 --> 10:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
rules and what this bill does as amended
 
10:08:34.630 --> 10:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
is to provide a pathway so that all the
 
10:08:36.670 --> 10:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
mandated vaccines will come to a vote of
 
10:08:39.870 --> 10:08:39.880 align:start position:0%

10:08:44.310 --> 10:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
preserves a pathway for a onetime a

10:12:38.510 --> 10:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
10:12:41.310 --> 10:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker if we earlier today discussed
 
10:12:43.550 --> 10:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
how vulnerable children are when they're
 
10:12:45.630 --> 10:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
sitting in a therapist office and we
 
10:12:47.426 --> 10:12:47.436 align:start position:0%
respected that
 
10:12:50.870 --> 10:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and if I know that parents
 
10:12:53.070 --> 10:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
should be involved in the therapy of
 
10:12:54.870 --> 10:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
their children and to at least know if
 
10:12:56.310 --> 10:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
their child is seeing a
 
10:12:58.310 --> 10:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
therapist and if I believe that this
 
10:13:00.586 --> 10:13:00.596 align:start position:0%
interferes with not only parental rights
 
10:13:02.990 --> 10:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
but family relationships would I press
 
10:13:06.230 --> 10:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
the press the green button to table this
 
10:13:08.670 --> 10:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
bill chair recogniz is representative
 
10:13:10.230 --> 10:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
Weber for a parliamentary
 
10:13:14.070 --> 10:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
inquir thank you Mr Speaker if I agree
 
10:13:15.950 --> 10:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
that parents should be involved but I
 
10:13:18.310 --> 10:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
know that there are many parents who are
 
10:13:21.030 --> 10:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
either disengaged or unable to engage
 
10:13:24.550 --> 10:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
and do not look after their children and
 
10:13:27.870 --> 10:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
if I know that by age 16 a child a minor
 
10:13:31.106 --> 10:13:31.116 align:start position:0%
can consent to sexual activity much as
 
10:13:35.150 --> 10:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
we wish they wouldn't and to uh be
 
10:13:37.310 --> 10:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
treated for a sexually transmitted
 
10:13:40.470 --> 10:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
disease and TR and treated for drug
 
10:13:42.426 --> 10:13:42.436 align:start position:0%
abuse and substance
 
10:13:45.390 --> 10:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
abuse and if I know it makes no

60 thank you Mr
 
10:20:55.586 --> 10:20:55.596 align:start position:0%
Speaker we all agree and we heard
 
10:20:58.870 --> 10:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
heart-rending stories and all of us have
 
10:21:01.790 --> 10:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
life experiences that lead us to the
 
10:21:07.390 --> 10:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
10:21:10.830 --> 10:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
everyone who is in hospital deserves the
 
10:21:14.830 --> 10:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
support and care of their loved
 
10:21:17.550 --> 10:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
ones and we worked very hard on this
 
10:21:19.510 --> 10:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill and we worked collaboratively on
 
10:21:23.266 --> 10:21:23.276 align:start position:0%
this bill and mo we came together on a
 
10:21:27.310 --> 10:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
lot of things so I'm I thank my
 
10:21:30.030 --> 10:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues for
 
10:21:34.510 --> 10:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
that the problem is that what we didn't
 
10:21:38.070 --> 10:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
agree on first of all we we agreed that
 
10:21:40.510 --> 10:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
a policy should be in the patients Bill
 
10:21:43.630 --> 10:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
of Rights that it should be the right of
 
10:21:43.640 --> 10:21:44.470 align:start position:0%
of Rights that it should be the right of
the

10:21:44.470 --> 10:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
10:21:47.390 --> 10:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
patient to have their loved ones with
 
10:21:49.990 --> 10:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
them when they're in a
 
10:21:53.586 --> 10:21:53.596 align:start position:0%
facility and we agreed that we would
 
10:21:56.266 --> 10:21:56.276 align:start position:0%
keep the language from the original
 
10:22:01.390 --> 10:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
bill that balances the rights of one
 
10:22:04.190 --> 10:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
patient to have the support and care of
 
10:22:06.746 --> 10:22:06.756 align:start position:0%
their family or loved ones with the
 
10:22:09.710 --> 10:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
rights of every other patient to also
 
10:22:12.670 --> 10:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
have appropriate care appropriate
 
10:22:15.870 --> 10:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
infection control and appropriate
 
10:22:19.510 --> 10:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
support that they need so the bill
 
10:22:21.906 --> 10:22:21.916 align:start position:0%
contains a set of
 
10:22:25.710 --> 10:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
balances that the presence of
 
10:22:27.990 --> 10:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
visitors has to
 
10:22:32.230 --> 10:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
be um medically and
 
10:22:35.586 --> 10:22:35.596 align:start position:0%
therapeutically uh indicated
 
10:22:38.830 --> 10:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
that the presence of visitors will not
 
10:22:40.790 --> 10:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
interfere with the care of
 
10:22:43.630 --> 10:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
others that visitors engaging disruptive
 
10:22:45.790 --> 10:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
and threatening or violent Behavior can
 
10:22:49.030 --> 10:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
be excluded and visitors non-compliant
 
10:22:52.030 --> 10:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
with Hospital policy can be in included
 
10:22:54.390 --> 10:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's in both bills that's the
 
10:22:57.510 --> 10:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
balancing that is important here's where
 
10:23:00.150 --> 10:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
the bills the Amendments
 
10:23:02.510 --> 10:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
differ in my
 
10:23:05.310 --> 10:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment those considerations are put
 
10:23:08.350 --> 10:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
just in the patients Bill of
 
10:23:12.350 --> 10:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
Rights in the amendment you just passed
 
10:23:15.106 --> 10:23:15.116 align:start position:0%
they are also put into the hospital
 
10:23:18.266 --> 10:23:18.276 align:start position:0%
licensing the facility licensing
 
10:23:21.906 --> 10:23:21.916 align:start position:0%
statute so
 
10:23:25.310 --> 10:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
when in the course of a terrible
 
10:23:28.990 --> 10:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic or other horrible
 
10:23:31.990 --> 10:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
emergency the hospital has to balance
 
10:23:35.630 --> 10:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
these rights and the amendment we just
 
10:23:39.030 --> 10:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
passed also requires that whenever a
 
10:23:41.426 --> 10:23:41.436 align:start position:0%
visitor is denied access it must be
 
10:23:44.030 --> 10:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
carefully charted into the medical
 
10:23:48.510 --> 10:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
records so at a time when resources are
 
10:23:52.030 --> 10:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
scarce and risks are
 
10:23:56.510 --> 10:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
high we are using valuable medical time
 
10:23:58.106 --> 10:23:58.116 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
10:24:00.830 --> 10:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
charting instead of caring for
 
10:24:03.550 --> 10:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
patients and at a time when hospitals
 
10:24:05.510 --> 10:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
are are having to make the most
 
10:24:07.350 --> 10:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
difficult of critical
 
10:24:09.990 --> 10:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
decisions we are putting their license
 
10:24:13.990 --> 10:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the line if they get it wrong so I
 
10:24:17.350 --> 10:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
believe that the appropriate thing is to
 
10:24:19.266 --> 10:24:19.276 align:start position:0%
give the rights to the patient and the
 
10:24:22.426 --> 10:24:22.436 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights protecting the
 
10:24:25.510 --> 10:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
rights of all patients and simply leave

Leon thank you Mr
 
10:24:41.790 --> 10:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
Speaker my colleague from Walpole is
 
10:24:43.670 --> 10:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
right that it is good to be able to have
 
10:24:45.830 --> 10:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
patients have visitors it is good for
 
10:24:46.990 --> 10:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
their health it is good for their
 
10:24:48.746 --> 10:24:48.756 align:start position:0%
outcome and it is good for their family
 
10:24:50.790 --> 10:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
members that don't know if they'll ever
 
10:24:54.230 --> 10:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
see them again in committee we heard
 
10:24:56.390 --> 10:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
people here in New Hampshire they were
 
10:24:58.106 --> 10:24:58.116 align:start position:0%
unable to see their daughters that were
 
10:25:01.710 --> 10:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
my age and those daughters died of Co in
 
10:25:01.720 --> 10:25:02.670 align:start position:0%
my age and those daughters died of Co in
the

10:25:02.670 --> 10:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
10:25:02.680 --> 10:25:04.190 align:start position:0%
the
hospital

10:25:04.190 --> 10:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
10:25:07.710 --> 10:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
it was worse that nobody knew what to
 
10:25:10.070 --> 10:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
expect you didn't know what the
 
10:25:12.630 --> 10:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
visitation policies were you couldn't
 
10:25:15.350 --> 10:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
find them you didn't know what was going
 
10:25:19.230 --> 10:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
on why you would be denied and what was
 
10:25:21.150 --> 10:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
happening with your loved
 
10:25:24.150 --> 10:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
one the two differences we have are we
 
10:25:26.070 --> 10:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
put it in the licensing statute with the
 
10:25:28.190 --> 10:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
majority amendment that we've already
 
10:25:30.790 --> 10:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
adopted and we make it so that there'll
 
10:25:32.630 --> 10:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
be a documentation so that we know why
 
10:25:35.230 --> 10:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's been denied it's easy enough to
 
10:25:36.470 --> 10:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
when you're saying that the patient
 
10:25:38.830 --> 10:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
coded say the PO patient coded and we
 
10:25:41.310 --> 10:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
ask the family to leave it's a small
 
10:25:43.510 --> 10:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
change if you have a significant medical
 
10:25:45.830 --> 10:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
event you're already documenting it in
 
10:25:48.070 --> 10:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
the paperwork and this protects both the
 
10:25:49.790 --> 10:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
patients and their access to their
 
10:25:51.950 --> 10:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
family members and the hospitals if
 
10:25:54.470 --> 10:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
somebody's grieved and let's be honest
 
10:25:57.030 --> 10:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
these times are trying we've all been
 
10:25:59.630 --> 10:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
trying to survived these last two years
 
10:26:02.586 --> 10:26:02.596 align:start position:0%
with as little harm as
 
10:26:05.426 --> 10:26:05.436 align:start position:0%
possible if we stay if we defeat this
 
10:26:07.550 --> 10:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
amendment and stay with the majority
 
10:26:09.906 --> 10:26:09.916 align:start position:0%
amendment that we've already adopted
 
10:26:11.390 --> 10:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
this they will have to have their
 
10:26:14.390 --> 10:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
policies online and on the wall of every
 
10:26:17.106 --> 10:26:17.116 align:start position:0%
patient room so that when the patient is
 
10:26:19.030 --> 10:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
upset or a visitor is upset if they have
 
10:26:21.906 --> 10:26:21.916 align:start position:0%
to leave the provider can say right here
 
10:26:24.746 --> 10:26:24.756 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but this is a risk to another
 
10:26:26.190 --> 10:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
patient's rights and so we need to ask
 
10:26:27.070 --> 10:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
you to
 
10:26:30.030 --> 10:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
leave we'll have transparency we'll have
 
10:26:32.030 --> 10:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
Clarity and we can move on with the
 
10:26:35.390 --> 10:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
business of healing so I ask you to vote
 
10:26:37.426 --> 10:26:37.436 align:start position:0%

in New Hampshire we had family members
 
10:26:55.746 --> 10:26:55.756 align:start position:0%

10:26:58.586 --> 10:26:58.596 align:start position:0%
family member had Co was dying and could
 
10:27:00.870 --> 10:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
not go in would not let them wear a mask
 
10:27:02.470 --> 10:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
they had to stay outside while the
 
10:27:05.310 --> 10:27:05.320 align:start position:0%

know that that happened in many
 
10:27:13.830 --> 10:27:13.840 align:start position:0%

10:29:13.070 --> 10:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
10:29:15.426 --> 10:29:15.436 align:start position:0%
that no one is arguing that people
 
10:29:16.630 --> 10:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
should be
 
10:29:19.426 --> 10:29:19.436 align:start position:0%
excluded from supporting their loved
 
10:29:22.106 --> 10:29:22.116 align:start position:0%
ones and if I know that the terms of
 
10:29:25.670 --> 10:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
these two amendments are basically the
 
10:29:31.150 --> 10:29:31.160 align:start position:0%
same except for the extra burdens put on
 
10:29:35.106 --> 10:29:35.116 align:start position:0%
a Health Care Facility at a time of
 
10:29:38.350 --> 10:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
emergency when resources are scarce
 
10:29:41.266 --> 10:29:41.276 align:start position:0%
Personnel is scarce time is
 
10:29:46.906 --> 10:29:46.916 align:start position:0%
scarce and extra burdens will result in
 
10:29:49.630 --> 10:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
bad Health outcomes to some of the
 
10:29:52.426 --> 10:29:52.436 align:start position:0%
patients would I now
 
10:29:55.830 --> 10:29:55.840 align:start position:0%

10:29:57.426 --> 10:29:57.436 align:start position:0%

for parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
 
10:30:04.510 --> 10:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker if if I know that the patient
 
10:30:06.586 --> 10:30:06.596 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights already protects the
 
10:30:09.030 --> 10:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
right to have a visitor when death is
 
10:30:11.310 --> 10:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
imminent but that was not always
 
10:30:14.106 --> 10:30:14.116 align:start position:0%
granted and if I know that a law without
 
10:30:16.030 --> 10:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
teeth is only a
 
10:30:19.266 --> 10:30:19.276 align:start position:0%
suggestion and if I know that while a
 
10:30:21.310 --> 10:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
large step putting this in the licensing
 
10:30:23.950 --> 10:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
statute may actually guarantee that the
 
10:30:25.870 --> 10:30:25.880 align:start position:0%

bill at the hearing a conflict caused by
 
10:33:45.426 --> 10:33:45.436 align:start position:0%
this bill was identified but it was
 
10:33:48.070 --> 10:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
never addressed in the committee process
 
10:33:51.550 --> 10:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
HB 1455 prohibits the state of New
 
10:33:53.070 --> 10:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and any of its subdivisions
 
10:33:54.950 --> 10:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
from assisting in the enforcement of any
 
10:33:58.106 --> 10:33:58.116 align:start position:0%
federal order rule or law which requires
 
10:34:00.350 --> 10:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
a person to submit proof of vaccination
 
10:34:00.360 --> 10:34:01.390 align:start position:0%
a person to submit proof of vaccination
against

10:34:01.390 --> 10:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
against
 
10:34:04.630 --> 10:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
covid-19 as a condition of
 
10:34:08.230 --> 10:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
employment but this creates a conflict
 
10:34:10.310 --> 10:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Health and Human
 
10:34:13.630 --> 10:34:13.640 align:start position:0%
Services because DHHS is a state agency
 
10:34:16.746 --> 10:34:16.756 align:start position:0%
and it is responsible for confirming
 
10:34:19.390 --> 10:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
that health care facilities are in
 
10:34:22.746 --> 10:34:22.756 align:start position:0%
compliance with Federal mandates as part
 
10:34:25.230 --> 10:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
of the accreditation process of a health
 
10:34:25.240 --> 10:34:26.190 align:start position:0%
of the accreditation process of a health

10:34:26.190 --> 10:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
care
 
10:34:28.746 --> 10:34:28.756 align:start position:0%
facility and this includes compliance
 
10:34:31.746 --> 10:34:31.756 align:start position:0%
with the CMS mandate requiring covid-19
 
10:34:33.710 --> 10:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination of healthare
 
10:34:37.310 --> 10:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
workers so prohibiting DHHS from doing
 
10:34:40.426 --> 10:34:40.436 align:start position:0%
their duty of accrediting Health Care
 
10:34:43.390 --> 10:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
Facilities that'll have impacts it'll
 
10:34:46.070 --> 10:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
lead to a loss of accrediation of
 
10:34:48.150 --> 10:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
facilities that leads to a loss of
 
10:34:51.870 --> 10:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from CMS for Medicaid and
 
10:34:54.870 --> 10:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
for Medicare patients and ultimately for
 
10:34:57.670 --> 10:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
termination from Medicare and Medicaid
 
10:35:00.510 --> 10:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
programs and remember Medicaid provides
 
10:35:04.470 --> 10:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
the majority of funding for our nurs ing
 
10:35:07.070 --> 10:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
homes it will also lead to payment loss
 
10:35:09.266 --> 10:35:09.276 align:start position:0%
of payment from private
 
10:35:11.830 --> 10:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
insurers the reason is they they don't
 
10:35:13.830 --> 10:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
pay unaccredited
 
10:35:16.106 --> 10:35:16.116 align:start position:0%
facilities the loss of reimbursements
 
10:35:18.790 --> 10:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
will require the state of New Hampshire
 
10:35:22.030 --> 10:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
or our counties or both to backfill
 
10:35:25.030 --> 10:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars in
 
10:35:26.950 --> 10:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
funding to keep our hospitals and
 
10:35:28.510 --> 10:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
10:35:31.670 --> 10:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
open now in January 13 the US Supreme
 
10:35:33.586 --> 10:35:33.596 align:start position:0%
Court upheld the CM mandate for the
 
10:35:35.830 --> 10:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination of healthcare workers they
 
10:35:37.990 --> 10:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
stayed the lower court injunction and if
 
10:35:39.710 --> 10:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
you read the text at their decision they
 
10:35:42.230 --> 10:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
make it really really clear that they
 
10:35:45.550 --> 10:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
support the CMS vaccine mandate if it
 
10:35:47.150 --> 10:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
makes it through some appeal process and
 
10:35:50.070 --> 10:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
comes to them they will still support it
 
10:35:51.350 --> 10:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
but furthermore there have been no
 
10:35:53.150 --> 10:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
appeals to that Supreme Court decision
 
10:35:54.870 --> 10:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
in the two months that have elapsed
 
10:35:57.510 --> 10:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
since that time so it
 
10:35:59.950 --> 10:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
stands I do not think that the state of
 
10:36:03.390 --> 10:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should Place itself and
 
10:36:05.990 --> 10:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
our counties in the position of needing
 
10:36:08.310 --> 10:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
to backfill hundreds of millions of
 
10:36:11.230 --> 10:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
dollars of funding to keep our hospitals
 
10:36:13.710 --> 10:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
and nursing homes open so I would
 
10:36:15.950 --> 10:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
encourage you to press the red button to
 
10:36:18.746 --> 10:36:18.756 align:start position:0%
vote no on hb1
 
10:36:21.990 --> 10:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
1455 so another motion can be brought
 
10:36:24.106 --> 10:36:24.116 align:start position:0%
forth and I would request a division
 
10:36:31.586 --> 10:36:31.596 align:start position:0%

Pearson thank you Mr Speaker and might I
 
10:37:01.310 --> 10:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
add thank you Mr Speaker the balance of
 
10:37:03.710 --> 10:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
power and responsibility ility between
 
10:37:06.746 --> 10:37:06.756 align:start position:0%
the federal government and the states
 
10:37:09.746 --> 10:37:09.756 align:start position:0%
has often tilted against that wonderful
 
10:37:12.310 --> 10:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
balance in shrined in the 10th
 
10:37:14.990 --> 10:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment in the 19th century some
 
10:37:18.230 --> 10:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
northern states passed personal Liberty
 
10:37:22.106 --> 10:37:22.116 align:start position:0%
laws which made it illegal for citizens
 
10:37:24.710 --> 10:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
of their states to help enforce the
 
10:37:28.870 --> 10:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
federal Fugitive Slave Act and in our
 
10:37:31.670 --> 10:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
day some states uh perhaps different
 
10:37:34.950 --> 10:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
from us in their political beliefs have
 
10:37:38.790 --> 10:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
claimed the right to be Sanctuary States
 
10:37:41.106 --> 10:37:41.116 align:start position:0%
and thus ban cooperation with Federal
 
10:37:43.550 --> 10:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
authorities regarding illegal
 
10:37:46.310 --> 10:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
immigrants I've heard this commended
 
10:37:49.390 --> 10:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
Yesterday by members of the party across
 
10:37:53.150 --> 10:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
the aisle if we agree with them and such
 
10:37:56.550 --> 10:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
States then and now not so much exactly
 
10:37:59.790 --> 10:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
on the specific topic but on the idea of
 
10:38:02.990 --> 10:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
saying no then the legitimacy of a
 
10:38:06.310 --> 10:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
mandated lack of cooperation we should
 
10:38:08.906 --> 10:38:08.916 align:start position:0%
understand is the motivation behind this
 
10:38:11.906 --> 10:38:11.916 align:start position:0%
bill I know that some other states have
 
10:38:14.266 --> 10:38:14.276 align:start position:0%
similarly asserted rights on this very
 
10:38:16.630 --> 10:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
subject matter contained in this
 
10:38:18.746 --> 10:38:18.756 align:start position:0%
absolutely wonderful brilliantly
 
10:38:23.106 --> 10:38:23.116 align:start position:0%
 
10:38:25.670 --> 10:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
Bill and they've not lost Federal
 
10:38:28.746 --> 10:38:28.756 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for Medicare or
 
10:38:30.950 --> 10:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and in terms of what the
 
10:38:33.070 --> 10:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court might do
 
10:38:33.080 --> 10:38:33.746 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court might do
in

10:38:33.746 --> 10:38:33.756 align:start position:0%
in
 
10:38:36.990 --> 10:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
1997 the Supreme Court ruled in prince
 
10:38:39.550 --> 10:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
versus the United States that Congress
 
10:38:41.470 --> 10:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
cannot make the states enforced the
 
10:38:44.030 --> 10:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
federal Brady gun control law which
 
10:38:47.230 --> 10:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
attempted to require local sheriffs or
 
10:38:49.990 --> 10:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
police to carry out background checks
 
10:38:52.746 --> 10:38:52.756 align:start position:0%
for the federal
 
10:38:55.350 --> 10:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
governments I recommend we pass this
 
10:38:57.426 --> 10:38:57.436 align:start position:0%
bill and stand with other states
 
10:39:00.670 --> 10:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
Progressive conservative and in between
 
10:39:03.790 --> 10:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
so that the movement to re res set the
 
10:39:05.990 --> 10:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
balance between the federal government
 
10:39:08.350 --> 10:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
and the individual states can continue
 
10:39:11.586 --> 10:39:11.596 align:start position:0%
to grow I think we should stand together
 
10:39:13.230 --> 10:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
with all these other states that are
 
10:39:16.070 --> 10:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
saying to the federal government we are
 
10:39:16.080 --> 10:39:17.586 align:start position:0%
saying to the federal government we are
proudly

10:39:17.586 --> 10:39:17.596 align:start position:0%
proudly
 
10:39:20.630 --> 10:39:20.640 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
10:40:22.870 --> 10:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill will prohibit
 
10:40:24.266 --> 10:40:24.276 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
10:40:26.190 --> 10:40:26.200 align:start position:0%

10:40:29.070 --> 10:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
facilities and if I know that that loss
 
10:40:31.266 --> 10:40:31.276 align:start position:0%
of accreditation will place in Jeopardy
 
10:40:33.426 --> 10:40:33.436 align:start position:0%
the facility revenues from Medicare

insurers and if I know that the loss of
 
10:40:39.830 --> 10:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue will require the state and the
 
10:40:42.470 --> 10:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
counties to backfill a couple of hundred
 
10:40:44.550 --> 10:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually just to keep
 
10:40:47.550 --> 10:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
our hospitals and nursing homes open and
 
10:40:49.310 --> 10:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
if I know that it might be a bit of a
 
10:40:52.470 --> 10:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
stretch to compare slavery with
 
10:40:54.870 --> 10:40:54.880 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
10:41:17.310 --> 10:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
that the powers of the federal
 
10:41:19.190 --> 10:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
government are limited to those
 
10:41:20.630 --> 10:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
delegated by the
 
10:41:22.870 --> 10:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution and if I know that states
 
10:41:24.990 --> 10:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
have successfully asserted their right
 
10:41:27.030 --> 10:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
to determine policy on things ranging
 
10:41:29.350 --> 10:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
from fugitive slaves to immigration

covid-19 and Mr Speaker if I know that
 
10:47:52.426 --> 10:47:52.436 align:start position:0%

forbid the state or any of its political
 
10:51:03.870 --> 10:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
subdivisions so your towns your County
 
10:51:07.710 --> 10:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
nursing homes all of that stuff uh from
 
10:51:10.830 --> 10:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
enforcing any federal vaccine mandates
 
10:51:13.830 --> 10:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to government contract
 
10:51:16.426 --> 10:51:16.436 align:start position:0%
people receiving government
 
10:51:21.510 --> 10:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
10:51:23.746 --> 10:51:23.756 align:start position:0%
immediately thank
 
10:51:23.756 --> 10:51:25.390 align:start position:0%
immediately thank
you

10:51:25.390 --> 10:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
10:51:27.870 --> 10:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
immediately when we started listening to
 
10:51:31.350 --> 10:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
this we ran up to the usual problem what
 
10:51:34.266 --> 10:51:34.276 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the state might
 
10:51:38.426 --> 10:51:38.436 align:start position:0%
be doing is the licensing of hospitals
 
10:51:42.510 --> 10:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
and nursing homes and they are
 
10:51:44.906 --> 10:51:44.916 align:start position:0%
contracted with the federal government
 
10:51:47.550 --> 10:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
to enforce certain federal mandates
 
10:51:50.710 --> 10:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
because of the centers for Medicare and
 
10:51:53.390 --> 10:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and the majority Amendment
 
10:51:56.030 --> 10:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
actually recognizes this might be a
 
10:51:58.190 --> 10:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
problem and carved that out as an
 
10:52:01.266 --> 10:52:01.276 align:start position:0%
exception to their Amendment so that was
 
10:52:03.266 --> 10:52:03.276 align:start position:0%
was a plus with the
 
10:52:05.746 --> 10:52:05.756 align:start position:0%
amendment on the other hand the
 
10:52:09.190 --> 10:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendment also broadened the
 
10:52:12.106 --> 10:52:12.116 align:start position:0%
state's uh prohibition from enforcing
 
10:52:15.630 --> 10:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
any mandate or seeing any
 
10:52:18.906 --> 10:52:18.916 align:start position:0%
documentation on any business at all in
 
10:52:20.510 --> 10:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
10:52:23.390 --> 10:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the concern that I have with
 
10:52:27.510 --> 10:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
that is that we already knew there was a
 
10:52:30.150 --> 10:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
problem in one Health Care area with
 
10:52:30.160 --> 10:52:31.870 align:start position:0%
problem in one Health Care area with
that

10:52:31.870 --> 10:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
10:52:34.790 --> 10:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
and we on the Health and Human Services
 
10:52:38.190 --> 10:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
committee do not know what other
 
10:52:41.830 --> 10:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
conflicts we are creating with the

Lon thank you Mr Speaker I think we all
 
10:53:06.630 --> 10:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
know that last fall a lot of bills were
 
10:53:08.870 --> 10:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
filed because we weren't sure what this
 
10:53:09.990 --> 10:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
year would
 
10:53:13.906 --> 10:53:13.916 align:start position:0%
bring this amendment distills down a
 
10:53:15.790 --> 10:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
bill that was filed to some of the very
 
10:53:18.670 --> 10:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
core ideas the fact that the state
 
10:53:22.070 --> 10:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
should not be requiring businesses to
 
10:53:24.710 --> 10:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
act as their enforcement arm this
 
10:53:26.550 --> 10:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't prohibit businesses from making
 
10:53:29.070 --> 10:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
their own choice and those businesses
 
10:53:30.746 --> 10:53:30.756 align:start position:0%
that have different rules or regulations
 
10:53:33.670 --> 10:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
upon them probably have a reason to
 
10:53:34.906 --> 10:53:34.916 align:start position:0%
check on their
 
10:53:37.390 --> 10:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
own so that they can comply with
 
10:53:40.030 --> 10:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
whatever they believe is in their best
 
10:53:42.390 --> 10:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
interest what this bill Amendment this
 
10:53:45.550 --> 10:53:45.560 align:start position:0%
bill is amendment does is it says that
 
10:53:48.630 --> 10:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
the state and any subdivision can't
 
10:53:50.790 --> 10:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
require a business to check for
 
10:53:52.830 --> 10:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination except for the childhood
 
10:53:55.630 --> 10:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
immunization rules because if we ban
 
10:53:57.510 --> 10:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we'd get rid of child care and we
 
10:53:58.710 --> 10:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to do
 
10:54:01.746 --> 10:54:01.756 align:start position:0%
that it also says that we can't to ask a
 
10:54:03.870 --> 10:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
business to check for documentation of
 
10:54:06.586 --> 10:54:06.596 align:start position:0%
vaccination status so we don't end up in
 
10:54:06.596 --> 10:54:07.710 align:start position:0%
vaccination status so we don't end up in
the

10:54:07.710 --> 10:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
10:54:10.106 --> 10:54:10.116 align:start position:0%
situation where in New York City
 
10:54:12.426 --> 10:54:12.436 align:start position:0%
McDonald's was turning away customers
 
10:54:15.630 --> 10:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
from eating inside the building because
 
10:54:19.470 --> 10:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
10:54:23.030 --> 10:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and we have a carve out here
 
10:54:24.630 --> 10:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
we do have a carve out that says that
 
10:54:26.670 --> 10:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
this shall not apply to State agencies
 
10:54:29.470 --> 10:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
certifying a medical facility or private
 
10:54:31.550 --> 10:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
or or provider
 
10:54:33.630 --> 10:54:33.640 align:start position:0%
which is subject to a valid and
 
10:54:36.266 --> 10:54:36.276 align:start position:0%
enforcable Medicaid or Medicare
 
10:54:38.670 --> 10:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
condition of participation that imposes
 
10:54:40.470 --> 10:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
a vaccination
 
10:54:43.710 --> 10:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
requirement this bill is simple it makes
 
10:54:45.470 --> 10:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
it so that businesses won't be the
 
10:54:48.586 --> 10:54:48.596 align:start position:0%
enforcement arm of the state so I ask
 
10:54:50.070 --> 10:54:50.080 align:start position:0%

amendment but we don't know what other
 
10:56:19.266 --> 10:56:19.276 align:start position:0%
problems lurk out there because people
 
10:56:21.190 --> 10:56:21.200 align:start position:0%

for parliamentary
 
11:01:05.266 --> 11:01:05.276 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I
 
11:01:07.390 --> 11:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
believe reproductive justice meaning
 
11:01:09.586 --> 11:01:09.596 align:start position:0%
that all people regarding of race class
 
11:01:11.830 --> 11:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
or gender have the right to make
 
11:01:14.350 --> 11:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
autonomous reproductive decisions and
 
11:01:16.266 --> 11:01:16.276 align:start position:0%
should have the resources and support to
 
11:01:19.230 --> 11:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
do so and if I know that that the
 
11:01:21.670 --> 11:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont house recently moved to put
 
11:01:23.550 --> 11:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
protections for Reproductive Rights into
 
11:01:25.710 --> 11:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
their state constitution and with
 
11:01:28.190 --> 11:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
attacks on both the national and state
 
11:01:31.190 --> 11:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
level we must protect this human right
 
11:01:34.030 --> 11:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that the overwhelming number
 
11:01:36.310 --> 11:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire constituents regardless

11:05:31.990 --> 11:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
that the changes propos in HB
 
11:05:34.830 --> 11:05:34.840 align:start position:0%

11:05:39.950 --> 11:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
make the 91a rsas cumbersome inefficient

the public for hundreds of years has
 
11:05:58.470 --> 11:05:58.480 align:start position:0%

that HB 1014 will promote citizen

engagement with their local government
 
11:06:27.746 --> 11:06:27.756 align:start position:0%
officials and therefore strengthen our
 
11:06:29.586 --> 11:06:29.596 align:start position:0%
representative democracy by allowing
 
11:06:31.586 --> 11:06:31.596 align:start position:0%
them to participate remotely in public
 
11:06:33.990 --> 11:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
meetings an incredibly popular idea
 
11:06:36.630 --> 11:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
among Granite Staters and if I further
 
11:06:38.550 --> 11:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
know that this bill protects local
 
11:06:41.106 --> 11:06:41.116 align:start position:0%
control by simply providing guidance and
 
11:06:42.990 --> 11:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
not a requirement for a government body

thank you Mr
 
11:15:35.950 --> 11:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that New
 
11:15:37.550 --> 11:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is hip deep in the middle of a
 
11:15:39.990 --> 11:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
huge housing crisis if I know that we
 
11:15:42.030 --> 11:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
need to be encouraging more landlords to
 
11:15:43.790 --> 11:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
enter into the market and not placing
 
11:15:45.390 --> 11:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
new burdens that would push them out of
 
11:15:48.390 --> 11:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
the market and if I know that hb1 1291
 
11:15:50.310 --> 11:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
would forcefully drive all landlords
 
11:15:52.070 --> 11:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
into participating in the federal
 
11:15:54.510 --> 11:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
Section 8 Housing Voucher Program
 
11:15:56.510 --> 11:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
whether they wanted to or not and thus
 
11:15:58.350 --> 11:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
require that they unwillingly enter into
 
11:16:00.870 --> 11:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
contracts that they had no say in and if
 
11:16:02.106 --> 11:16:02.116 align:start position:0%
I believe that that would actually
 
11:16:04.070 --> 11:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
reduce the housing inventory would I now
 
11:16:06.470 --> 11:16:06.480 align:start position:0%

11:16:18.586 --> 11:16:18.596 align:start position:0%
that there are at least a few bills that
 
11:16:24.950 --> 11:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
11:16:29.070 --> 11:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
tabling and Mr Speaker knowing that the
 
11:16:32.630 --> 11:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
Section 8 housing program makes it
 
11:16:35.670 --> 11:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
possible for people who could not
 
11:16:39.310 --> 11:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise have access to decent housing
 
11:16:43.190 --> 11:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
and knowing that for landlords it's a
 
11:16:46.990 --> 11:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they're going to be paid
 
11:16:50.070 --> 11:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
because the money comes not necessarily
 
11:16:53.950 --> 11:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
from the uh the tenant but from the
 
11:16:57.990 --> 11:16:58.000 align:start position:0%

11:24:28.946 --> 11:24:28.956 align:start position:0%
recommendation of itl on hb1 147
 
11:24:31.510 --> 11:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
77 this is a bill that would ban
 
11:24:33.586 --> 11:24:33.596 align:start position:0%
abortion after the detection of a fetal
 
11:24:37.230 --> 11:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
heartbeat as defined as cardiac activity
 
11:24:39.190 --> 11:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
or the steady repetitive rhythmic
 
11:24:42.310 --> 11:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
contraction of the fetal
 
11:24:45.550 --> 11:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
heart one of the things that uh the Row
 
11:24:48.426 --> 11:24:48.436 align:start position:0%
versus way decision sought to explore
 
11:24:51.586 --> 11:24:51.596 align:start position:0%
was where life begins and they went and
 
11:24:53.190 --> 11:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
they looked at The Many religious
 
11:24:55.350 --> 11:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
beliefs practiced throughout the country
 
11:24:57.190 --> 11:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
and what they found was there was no
 
11:24:58.630 --> 11:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
consistency there there was a great
 
11:25:00.190 --> 11:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
amount of disagreement within those
 
11:25:01.630 --> 11:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
beliefs and so you couldn't just settle
 
11:25:04.390 --> 11:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
in on One Faith so putting religion
 
11:25:07.070 --> 11:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
aside they also went and they found that
 
11:25:11.070 --> 11:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
doctors had many varying views as well
 
11:25:13.630 --> 11:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
but one area of agreement however was
 
11:25:16.586 --> 11:25:16.596 align:start position:0%
that most doctors tended to believe that
 
11:25:21.266 --> 11:25:21.276 align:start position:0%
life began at some time before birth and
 
11:25:23.906 --> 11:25:23.916 align:start position:0%
it's for that reason that the row Court
 
11:25:26.830 --> 11:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
held that the right to abortion was not
 
11:25:29.150 --> 11:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
absolute and it tried to balance a
 
11:25:31.746 --> 11:25:31.756 align:start position:0%
woman's right to privacy and the fetus's
 
11:25:36.350 --> 11:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
right to exist hb1 1477 simply looks at
 
11:25:39.230 --> 11:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
all the scientific a information that
 
11:25:41.550 --> 11:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
was not available to the r Court 50
 
11:25:44.586 --> 11:25:44.596 align:start position:0%
years ago and it asked the question does
 
11:25:46.946 --> 11:25:46.956 align:start position:0%
Life Begin earlier than the r Court
 
11:25:49.990 --> 11:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
thought and does that enhance the right
 
11:25:54.266 --> 11:25:54.276 align:start position:0%
of the fetus to maintain his or her
 
11:25:56.630 --> 11:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
life we now know a lot more about the
 
11:25:58.470 --> 11:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
complexities of fetal development than
 
11:26:01.426 --> 11:26:01.436 align:start position:0%
the RO Court could ever imagine and in
 
11:26:02.906 --> 11:26:02.916 align:start position:0%
light of that expanded knowledge the
 
11:26:04.870 --> 11:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
minority felt that while the rights of
 
11:26:06.630 --> 11:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
the mother are
 
11:26:09.030 --> 11:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
undiminished the rights of the fetus are
 
11:26:11.630 --> 11:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
elevated to a point where its status
 
11:26:13.150 --> 11:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
must be
 
11:26:14.990 --> 11:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
reconsidered at the stage of Life
 
11:26:17.030 --> 11:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
defined in this bill where fetal
 
11:26:19.390 --> 11:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
heartbeat has been detected the minority
 
11:26:21.230 --> 11:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
felt that the development had Advanced
 
11:26:23.630 --> 11:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
to the point where the fetus's status as
 
11:26:26.426 --> 11:26:26.436 align:start position:0%
an individual human entity has been
 
11:26:28.310 --> 11:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
established and we therefore ask you
 
11:26:30.670 --> 11:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
overturn the itl motion so the motion of
 
11:26:32.830 --> 11:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
OTP can be brought forward thank you Mr

Written House Bill
 
11:27:22.470 --> 11:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
1477 as written is a near total ban on
 
11:27:24.230 --> 11:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
abortion within the state of New
 
11:27:26.790 --> 11:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were this bill to pass it
 
11:27:29.990 --> 11:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
would essentially and access to abortion
 
11:27:32.150 --> 11:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as it is being on
 
11:27:35.710 --> 11:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
abortion at around 6 weeks only two
 
11:27:39.030 --> 11:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
weeks after a woman's first missed menes
 
11:27:41.830 --> 11:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
a time when many women have not even do
 
11:27:44.830 --> 11:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
not even know that she's pregnant to put
 
11:27:47.426 --> 11:27:47.436 align:start position:0%
it in another way this bill could take
 
11:27:49.230 --> 11:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
away a woman's right to make her own
 
11:27:52.266 --> 11:27:52.276 align:start position:0%
medical decision before she even knows
 
11:27:55.230 --> 11:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
that she has a decision to make House
 
11:27:55.240 --> 11:27:56.426 align:start position:0%
that she has a decision to make House
Bill

11:27:56.426 --> 11:27:56.436 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
11:27:59.030 --> 11:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
1477 is while wild ly out of step with
 
11:28:02.310 --> 11:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
the granite state values abortion Bans
 
11:28:05.746 --> 11:28:05.756 align:start position:0%
are a deeply held popular view in New
 
11:28:08.426 --> 11:28:08.436 align:start position:0%
Hampshire instead we've had a long we've
 
11:28:11.630 --> 11:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
had a long proud bipartisan tradition of
 
11:28:14.630 --> 11:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
supporting reproductive Freedom the vast
 
11:28:17.550 --> 11:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
majority of granite Staters believe that
 
11:28:20.426 --> 11:28:20.436 align:start position:0%
personal private medical decisions
 
11:28:22.670 --> 11:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
should be between the individual and the
 
11:28:26.070 --> 11:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
doctor not the individual and
 
11:28:28.630 --> 11:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
politicians we can all agree
 
11:28:30.870 --> 11:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters deserve access to the
 
11:28:33.510 --> 11:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
best medical care available without
 
11:28:35.586 --> 11:28:35.596 align:start position:0%
shame or government
 
11:28:38.230 --> 11:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
interference if this bill were to pass
 
11:28:40.470 --> 11:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
that would no longer be the case for a
 
11:28:43.586 --> 11:28:43.596 align:start position:0%
woman seeking abortion care passage of
 
11:28:46.670 --> 11:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would force a woman who cannot
 
11:28:49.266 --> 11:28:49.276 align:start position:0%
who can afford an abortion to leave and
 
11:28:51.550 --> 11:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
go out of state for those women who
 
11:28:53.906 --> 11:28:53.916 align:start position:0%
could not travel out of state due to
 
11:28:57.310 --> 11:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
lack of finances or Transportation she
 
11:28:59.070 --> 11:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
would be forced to remain pregnant
 
11:29:00.230 --> 11:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
against her
 
11:29:03.586 --> 11:29:03.596 align:start position:0%
will further this would Rob her of the
 
11:29:06.390 --> 11:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
trust the guidance and the expertise of
 
11:29:08.870 --> 11:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
the competent Medical Professional she
 
11:29:11.630 --> 11:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
had selected when making with her
 
11:29:14.710 --> 11:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
partner if she Cho so chooses one of the
 
11:29:18.426 --> 11:29:18.436 align:start position:0%
most intimate and personal of life's
 
11:29:21.150 --> 11:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
decisions instead instead the decision
 
11:29:23.586 --> 11:29:23.596 align:start position:0%
would follow a predetermined path that
 
11:29:26.830 --> 11:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
had been legislatively mandated by
 
11:29:26.840 --> 11:29:29.586 align:start position:0%
had been legislatively mandated by
1477

11:29:29.586 --> 11:29:29.596 align:start position:0%
1477
 
11:29:32.070 --> 11:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
finally we don't have to imagine the
 
11:29:34.470 --> 11:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
impact of this abortion bill we can
 
11:29:36.946 --> 11:29:36.956 align:start position:0%
simply look to the state of Texas and
 
11:29:39.350 --> 11:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
see the Havoc that the abortion bills
 
11:29:41.790 --> 11:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
that have been created in Texas have
 
11:29:44.230 --> 11:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
placed on the mental health the Health
 
11:29:44.240 --> 11:29:45.586 align:start position:0%
placed on the mental health the Health

11:29:45.586 --> 11:29:45.596 align:start position:0%

Paige thank you Mr
 
11:36:42.746 --> 11:36:42.756 align:start position:0%
Speaker I rise today in opposition to
 
11:36:45.390 --> 11:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that hb1 1490 ought
 
11:36:47.946 --> 11:36:47.956 align:start position:0%
to pass under our state's
 
11:36:50.266 --> 11:36:50.276 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statutes this bill
 
11:36:52.710 --> 11:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
would create a new but undefined
 
11:36:55.510 --> 11:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
category of protected class vaccination
 
11:36:57.630 --> 11:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
status in addition the bill would
 
11:36:59.870 --> 11:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
prohibit places of public accommodation
 
11:37:02.266 --> 11:37:02.276 align:start position:0%
including Health Care Providers from
 
11:37:04.106 --> 11:37:04.116 align:start position:0%
denying entrance to someone based on
 
11:37:06.586 --> 11:37:06.596 align:start position:0%
their vaccination status and also
 
11:37:09.030 --> 11:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from requiring a person to
 
11:37:11.630 --> 11:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
use a medical device another undefined
 
11:37:12.710 --> 11:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
term in the
 
11:37:16.150 --> 11:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
bill as we contemplate creating another
 
11:37:19.190 --> 11:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
category of a protected class it's worth
 
11:37:21.550 --> 11:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
considering the other enumerated classes
 
11:37:23.746 --> 11:37:23.756 align:start position:0%
already protected against discrimination
 
11:37:26.106 --> 11:37:26.116 align:start position:0%
to which vaccination status would be
 
11:37:28.630 --> 11:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
added existing law prohibits
 
11:37:30.510 --> 11:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination in public accommodations
 
11:37:34.390 --> 11:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
based on categories such as age sex
 
11:37:37.266 --> 11:37:37.276 align:start position:0%
gender identity or race these are
 
11:37:39.946 --> 11:37:39.956 align:start position:0%
protected because Unfortunately they
 
11:37:41.790 --> 11:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
have faced a long history of
 
11:37:44.266 --> 11:37:44.276 align:start position:0%
discrimination and exercising the civil
 
11:37:47.586 --> 11:37:47.596 align:start position:0%
rights in this light adding vaccination
 
11:37:50.426 --> 11:37:50.436 align:start position:0%
status as a protected class seems
 
11:37:52.510 --> 11:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
ahistorical and
 
11:37:54.670 --> 11:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
misplaced but beyond that it's worth
 
11:37:56.870 --> 11:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about the purpose and context
 
11:37:58.990 --> 11:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
of of the state's anti-discrimination
 
11:38:02.906 --> 11:38:02.916 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 354a where this bill would
 
11:38:05.906 --> 11:38:05.916 align:start position:0%
rest if it became law was enacted under
 
11:38:07.906 --> 11:38:07.916 align:start position:0%
the state's police powers to protect the
 
11:38:10.470 --> 11:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
welfare and health of our citizens yet
 
11:38:13.190 --> 11:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
this bill if enacted would threaten
 
11:38:16.150 --> 11:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
Public Health rather than protect it for
 
11:38:17.830 --> 11:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
example this bill would be enforcable
 
11:38:19.790 --> 11:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
against Health Care Providers creating a
 
11:38:22.350 --> 11:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
scenario whereby these providers could
 
11:38:25.230 --> 11:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
not require vaccines or even masks
 
11:38:27.790 --> 11:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps thus potentially exposing
 
11:38:30.990 --> 11:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
employees and patients to lethal but
 
11:38:33.310 --> 11:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases such as
 
11:38:35.746 --> 11:38:35.756 align:start position:0%
covid-19 indeed at committee Healthcare
 
11:38:38.350 --> 11:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
Providers testified that the threat that
 
11:38:40.830 --> 11:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
this bill represents to their ability to
 
11:38:43.510 --> 11:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
effectively protect their employees and
 
11:38:46.586 --> 11:38:46.596 align:start position:0%
Patients health and safety surely such a
 
11:38:48.746 --> 11:38:48.756 align:start position:0%
result is that cross purposes with the
 
11:38:51.350 --> 11:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of RSA
 
11:38:54.550 --> 11:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
354a to protect the public safety and
 
11:38:56.990 --> 11:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
Welfare of our citizens and finally
 
11:38:58.350 --> 11:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
finally this bill suffers from
 
11:39:00.990 --> 11:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
significant definitional shortcomings
 
11:39:03.510 --> 11:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
both vaccination status and medical
 
11:39:05.670 --> 11:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
devices the operative terms of the bill
 
11:39:05.680 --> 11:39:06.470 align:start position:0%
devices the operative terms of the bill
are

11:39:06.470 --> 11:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
11:39:08.550 --> 11:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
undefined the Department of Justice
 
11:39:10.746 --> 11:39:10.756 align:start position:0%
noted that this vagueness would lead to
 
11:39:13.906 --> 11:39:13.916 align:start position:0%
an increase in complaints under the law
 
11:39:16.230 --> 11:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
diverting scarce resources to resolving
 
11:39:17.946 --> 11:39:17.956 align:start position:0%
the meaning and application of these
 
11:39:20.150 --> 11:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
terms I urge you to oppose the
 
11:39:24.470 --> 11:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
11:39:26.630 --> 11:39:26.640 align:start position:0%

w

11:39:35.426 --> 11:39:35.436 align:start position:0%
 
11:39:37.830 --> 11:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if
 
11:39:39.390 --> 11:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
there's anything we've heard
 
11:39:42.586 --> 11:39:42.596 align:start position:0%
about today and for the last couple of
 
11:39:46.586 --> 11:39:46.596 align:start position:0%
 
11:39:49.630 --> 11:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
vaccination and and can I be forced to
 
11:39:54.310 --> 11:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
get it and masks and do I have to wear
 
11:40:01.710 --> 11:40:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
11:40:04.630 --> 11:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker we looked at this bill can
 
11:40:07.470 --> 11:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
11:40:14.550 --> 11:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
11:40:17.070 --> 11:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
mic go ahead get any other advice or do
 
11:40:20.670 --> 11:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
11:40:23.150 --> 11:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
okay we had other bills that dealt with
 
11:40:25.470 --> 11:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
this same topic and you've heard a lot
 
11:40:27.630 --> 11:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
about it today about rights of to be
 
11:40:29.426 --> 11:40:29.436 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and conscience rights and all
 
11:40:29.436 --> 11:40:30.350 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and conscience rights and all
of

11:40:30.350 --> 11:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
11:40:30.360 --> 11:40:31.946 align:start position:0%
of
that

11:40:31.946 --> 11:40:31.956 align:start position:0%
that
 
11:40:36.190 --> 11:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
we chose to bring this one bill
 
11:40:40.030 --> 11:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
forward dealing narrowly with public
 
11:40:41.790 --> 11:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
accommodation because we hear a
 
11:40:44.670 --> 11:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr Speaker of people who
 
11:40:46.266 --> 11:40:46.276 align:start position:0%
couldn't go buy their
 
11:40:48.550 --> 11:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
groceries because they couldn't wear
 
11:40:51.426 --> 11:40:51.436 align:start position:0%
masks for medical reasons the medical
 
11:40:53.230 --> 11:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
device I I spent quite a bit of time
 
11:40:54.266 --> 11:40:54.276 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what kind of
 
11:40:57.510 --> 11:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
medical devices could apply to
 
11:40:58.990 --> 11:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
and the mask was the only one I could
 
11:41:06.790 --> 11:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
11:41:10.030 --> 11:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
more you can have it all right so so it

that vaccination status is a part of
 
11:41:19.150 --> 11:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
your personal privacy a part of your

status to New Hampshire law recognizing
 
11:43:48.710 --> 11:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine status as a protected class is
 
11:43:50.710 --> 11:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
an overreach and a questionable
 
11:43:53.746 --> 11:43:53.756 align:start position:0%
precedent and if I also know defining
 
11:43:56.230 --> 11:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine status as a protected class
 
11:43:58.510 --> 11:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
under the of the Civil Rights Act would
 
11:44:01.350 --> 11:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
make it impossible for health officials

thing if I know that your vaccination
 
11:44:54.586 --> 11:44:54.596 align:start position:0%

law was enacted in
 
11:51:09.550 --> 11:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
2014 and it's modeled after and largely
 
11:51:12.990 --> 11:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
similar to uh a Massachusetts law that
 
11:51:16.266 --> 11:51:16.276 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court struck down in June
 
11:51:19.510 --> 11:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
of that year now the Supreme

11:51:24.870 --> 11:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
extending a buffer zone from Clinic
 
11:51:27.510 --> 11:51:27.520 align:start position:0%

facilities chief justice Roberts in his
 
11:51:40.550 --> 11:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
opinion stated that authorities have
 
11:51:43.310 --> 11:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
many less intrusive ways to deal with
 
11:51:45.870 --> 11:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
problems outside the clinics and the
 
11:51:47.550 --> 11:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
committee heard testimony that existing
 
11:51:50.710 --> 11:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening laws are more than
 
11:51:53.790 --> 11:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
adequate to deal with most problems that
 
11:51:56.426 --> 11:51:56.436 align:start position:0%
arise given the Constitution
 
11:51:59.710 --> 11:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
issues plaguing this law one might ask
 
11:51:59.720 --> 11:52:00.550 align:start position:0%
issues plaguing this law one might ask
the

11:52:00.550 --> 11:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
11:52:03.230 --> 11:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
question why hasn't it been struck down
 
11:52:05.070 --> 11:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
like the Massachusetts law was struck
 
11:52:07.746 --> 11:52:07.756 align:start position:0%
down and the reason is simple after more
 
11:52:11.426 --> 11:52:11.436 align:start position:0%
than 7even years no abortion clinic or
 
11:52:13.106 --> 11:52:13.116 align:start position:0%
reproductive health facility in New
 
11:52:17.030 --> 11:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has ever implemented its
 
11:52:21.230 --> 11:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
Provisions ever as a result no one has
 
11:52:24.390 --> 11:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
ever had standing to take it to court so
 
11:52:27.190 --> 11:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
let that sink in for a little bit
 
11:52:29.470 --> 11:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
supporters of the bill repeatedly
 
11:52:33.230 --> 11:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
stressed its urgent need as a tool to
 
11:52:37.470 --> 11:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
keep clinics safe and yet having won the
 
11:52:41.190 --> 11:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
day they never implemented the law that
 
11:52:45.030 --> 11:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
they had fought so hard for every effort
 
11:52:47.990 --> 11:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
at appeal has led to a great outcry that
 
11:52:50.390 --> 11:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
women and Clinic staff would be
 
11:52:53.470 --> 11:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
subjected to increased danger if a repal
 
11:52:56.030 --> 11:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
were successful well guess what the
 
11:52:59.230 --> 11:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
repeals were never successful they were
 
11:53:01.426 --> 11:53:01.436 align:start position:0%
always unsuccessful and
 
11:53:04.470 --> 11:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
still the provisions of the law were
 
11:53:07.746 --> 11:53:07.756 align:start position:0%
never implemented so let me ask you this
 
11:53:10.106 --> 11:53:10.116 align:start position:0%
how can removing something that has
 
11:53:13.070 --> 11:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
never been implemented after 7 years
 
11:53:16.870 --> 11:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
11:53:20.150 --> 11:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
danger in this legislature we should not
 
11:53:22.870 --> 11:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
seek to burden the state with an
 
11:53:25.030 --> 11:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional law that looks to
 
11:53:27.190 --> 11:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
inhibit the right of our people to
 
11:53:29.550 --> 11:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
peacefully and prayerfully Express
 
11:53:32.746 --> 11:53:32.756 align:start position:0%
themselves this is especially the case
 
11:53:36.310 --> 11:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
when the law in question by its ongoing
 
11:53:39.670 --> 11:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
inaction turns a blind eye to the very
 
11:53:43.266 --> 11:53:43.276 align:start position:0%
people it purports to serve it's time
 
11:53:46.150 --> 11:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
for repeal and I hope you will join with
 
11:53:48.990 --> 11:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
me in overturning the itl motion on this
 
11:53:51.350 --> 11:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill so a motion of autop pass can be
 
11:53:54.230 --> 11:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
brought forward thank you Mr
 
11:53:56.990 --> 11:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker represent ative n has requested
 
11:53:58.586 --> 11:53:58.596 align:start position:0%
a roll call we're down to the last
 
11:54:01.030 --> 11:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
speaker is that sufficiently
 
11:54:03.470 --> 11:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
11:54:05.310 --> 11:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote
 
11:54:12.150 --> 11:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
11:54:17.310 --> 11:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
11:54:21.870 --> 11:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
11:54:25.670 --> 11:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker I rise today to speak in favor
 
11:54:27.150 --> 11:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the bipartisan majority
 
11:54:30.510 --> 11:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the Judiciary that HB
 
11:54:33.310 --> 11:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
1625 is inexpedient to
 
11:54:36.190 --> 11:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
legislate as we've heard HB 1625 would
 
11:54:38.266 --> 11:54:38.276 align:start position:0%
repeal the state's current patient
 
11:54:40.710 --> 11:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
safety zone law which provides for a
 
11:54:42.830 --> 11:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
safety zone around reproductive Health
 
11:54:42.840 --> 11:54:43.510 align:start position:0%
safety zone around reproductive Health
Care

11:54:43.510 --> 11:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
Care
 
11:54:45.906 --> 11:54:45.916 align:start position:0%
Facilities the bill is premised on the
 
11:54:48.030 --> 11:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
notion that our current law is
 
11:54:50.190 --> 11:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because the US Supreme
 
11:54:51.790 --> 11:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
Court struck down a restrictive
 
11:54:54.470 --> 11:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts law there are a few
 
11:54:56.190 --> 11:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
preliminary points to keep keep in mind
