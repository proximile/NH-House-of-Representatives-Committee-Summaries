00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
welcome to Ways and Means so when you
 
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
use these just make sure you turn it off
 
00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
when you're done so that any of your
 
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
background noise just doesn't get sent
 
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.969 align:start position:0%
background noise just doesn't get sent
around

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
well welcome we have a big year ahead of
 
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
us uh as you know Ways and Means is tax
 
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
tasks with many things including looking
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
at bills that are sent our way but also
 
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
importantly looking at Revenue estimates
 
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
and coming up with a proposal for our
 
00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
house budget writers
 
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
so today I thought we'd just get
 
00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
organized get to know each other a
 
00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
little bit we will start by doing some
 
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
introductions we have some staff here
 
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
who will introduce themselves and tell
 
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
us a little bit about what they do then
 
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go around the room with all
 
00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 align:start position:0%
of our members here if you could
 
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
introduce yourselves tell us a little
 
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
bit about your background maybe your
 
00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
experience in the house your experience
 
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
outside of the house so we know what
 
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
kind of perspective you have coming into
 
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
here and uh and then we'll start to go
 
00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
in more detail about you know processes
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
and procedures of the committee and get
 
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
all in sync on that and make a plan for
 
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
the next few weeks and then we will
 
00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
break for lunch around 11 30. I have
 
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
lunch coming in assortment of sandwiches
 
00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
and drinks and so forth so hopefully you
 
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
can stay we have permission to do that
 
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's a little unusual to have food in
 
00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
committee rooms but we have permission
 
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
to do that on this special day so and my
 
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
hope is that during that time you will
 
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 align:start position:0%
get to know each other more personally
 
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
and you know the best best part of
 
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
serving in the house I know we have a
 
00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
lot of freshmen in the room is the
 
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 align:start position:0%
committee work this is where we do the
 
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
Deep dive on policy this is where you
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
become the experts on these policies and
 
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
this is where you'll make the best
 
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
friends you'll have right here in this
 
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
room so um we'll have that lunch period
 
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
the Republicans will caucus separately
 
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
from 12 30 to 1 15 and that will be
 
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
upstairs in lob 300a it's a separate
 
00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
room for that purpose and then we'll
 
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
reconvene at 1 30 and we'll have the CPA
 
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
Society of New Hampshire and they will
 
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 align:start position:0%

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%

Ways and Means was definitely a choice
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%

needed help in getting services
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%

00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:03.289 align:start position:0%
depth and I enjoy that part here
as

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:05.340 align:start position:0%

we often find a way to come in place in
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
this committee uh because the numbers
 
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.230 align:start position:0%
this committee uh because the numbers
work

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%

become allergic to third world city air
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
and couldn't do that anymore came home
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
was sitting in a chair contemplating at
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
the age of 49 become reading novels the
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
rest of my life and walked into a
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
democratic office and got converted to
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
be a place filler on the on the ballot
 
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.020 align:start position:0%

but
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I I had thought
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
in doing that that if I happened to win
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
it would be an interesting place and I
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
actually sent a letter around to all of
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
The Independents and Democrats in
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
Lebanon which there were very few
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
Democrats at the time and I said
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
um I think that working with small
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
farmers and high-level researchers and
 
00:22:32.169 --> 00:22:32.179 align:start position:0%
high-level government officials
 
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
government officials and the rest of it
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
and doing a lot of surveys
 
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
like that is and doing budgets it's done
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
is going to translate to the legislature
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
and to my surprise it did
 
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm still here
 
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.210 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm still here
so

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
on I've been chair four times two of
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
those were during the Great Recession
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
we don't know if we're facing another of
 
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
those or we're just going to face a blip
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh coming but I think it's going to be
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily difficult for us to deal
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
with the revenue estimates this term
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
I had always regarded it being a
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a looking into a crystal
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
ball but this time the crystal ball is
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
broken as far as I
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we really have to all of us bring
 
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.570 align:start position:0%
so we really have to all of us bring
the

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
life experiences and skills that we
 
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
bring to this committee bring it to bear
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
on what can we do to make it more likely
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
that we'll come out with a real
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
a revenue estimate or the budgeters to
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
use guide them on that is going to
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.860 align:start position:0%

we lost some some strength in this
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee but we we kept some but we
 
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
lost we have we have a lot of new people
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
here I was asked to serve as your chair
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
because uh we really we need to develop
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
a team here we need to develop a lot of
 
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740 align:start position:0%

that um basically had to be installed in
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
all 50 states and seven jurisdictions to
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%

for health
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
I had my own small business time and uh
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
two years ago I let's pull the plug on
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
that and in the in the interim I started
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
working as a board member ran for the
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
select board in Plymouth and um got
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
elected as my fourth term
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
and the deal with Plymouth is um yeah we
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
um rather Frugal budget we have a
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
elementary school a Regional High School
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
and a university
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
and just about 60 of our properties are
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
owned by non-profits
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
and uh property taxes obviously a great
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
concern for Plymouth because here we go
 
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
up at least
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
or it might be even more so
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:37.860 align:start position:0%

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
there'll be plenty more time hopefully
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
to get to know each other on a deeper
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
level but representative spilsbury

me on all the lists as Walter but please
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
address me as Terry my Nick
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
um I grew up on Long Island and found my
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
way to Northern New England going to
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
college in Maine at Bowdoin
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh was determined I would
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
eventually get back here but I
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
went hither there and yawn in between
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
I went through law school and uh funny
 
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:30.419 align:start position:0%
enough I enjoyed tax policy enough that
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
I took three courses in tax in my law
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
school degree uh went on and it later
 
00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:40.460 align:start position:0%
got a MBA from Columbia
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
I was Maritime Council in the U.S Senate
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
for several years
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
and got heavily into the side of law
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
that most lawyers don't get into and
 
00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:56.180 align:start position:0%
that is drafting legislative language
 
00:34:59.570 --> 00:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
so so tax policy and legislative
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
language are things that are near and
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
dear to me
 
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh this is my second term uh in house
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
and turning the ways in me
 
00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:11.579 align:start position:0%
second term
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll just say that uh
 
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
I've been very pleased to be on Ways and
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
Means because I think it stands out as a
 
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:21.740 align:start position:0%
committee that's very collegial
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
and it's remarkable what a high
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
percentage of the bills we report out go
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
onto the consent calendar
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
um and I find that even in those
 
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.950 align:start position:0%
um and I find that even in those
situations

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh where there's a divided opinion it's
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's a very substantive and
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
respectful discussion so
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
um I think that makes it an extremely
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
satisfying committee to serve on
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
just sort of a preview for those who are
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
joining the committee for the first time
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
it makes it a very enjoyable commit
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
hang on good to see some familiar faces
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
and some new faces
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%

00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
much looking forward to the Dynamics
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
find one another under with this evenly
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%

um just real brief because I like to
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
pride myself on brevity and I think uh
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear that Ways and Means is

a more bipartisan
 
00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.910 align:start position:0%
a more bipartisan
approach

00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
education and that was
 
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.530 align:start position:0%
education and that was
experience

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh let's see my background is um I have
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
a degree in the philosophy and
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%

uh worked as a probation officer for
 
00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.069 align:start position:0%
uh worked as a probation officer for
years

00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
and then I decided to make some money
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
got into real estate now I only manage
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
my own real estate so I have my own
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
business I figured that would translate
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%

not sure where we went rock but we're
 
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
uh let's see I know when I die I'm going
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
to heaven because I've already been in
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh I was happily retired until Dan
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
McGuire who lives close to me
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
grab my ear and talked me into doing
 
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
grab my ear and talked me into doing
this

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
knowing Dan I know of course Carol
 
00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.490 align:start position:0%
knowing Dan I know of course Carol
McGuire

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
put me in touch with that gentleman over
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
there ubery oh no it's already and uh
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful thank you so much
 
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.670 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful thank you so much
everyone

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.750 align:start position:0%
everyone
um

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
there we go uh so I thought now we could
 
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:40.940 align:start position:0%
go over kind of what some of the
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
procedures are in the committee and some
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
of the expectations and talk through
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
some of the scheduling that we have to
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
worry about
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh we do want to make sure that this is
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
a very respectful committee
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh and that we are very orderly and fair
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
in how we do things did every one of you
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
attend a freshman orientation
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
did you get a chance to win you did not
 
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
so we there will be some procedures that
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
we might have to pull you aside and just
 
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
help you through a little bit but you
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
remember the pink cards remember that as
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
part of your training so anyone who
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
comes to testify on a bill will have to
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
fill out one of those cards and they
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
will all be sent to me and we'll try to
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
be very fair about making sure everyone
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
gets heard
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
and a reminder on the public hearings is
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
that we are here to listen when we have
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on a bill we first hear
 
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
from the sponsors why they're sponsoring
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh and then we hear from the public and
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
our job during the public hearing is not
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
to argue or to debate our job is to
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
listen so I'm going to be pretty strict
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
um you will ask all of your check
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
questions for the testifiers through the
 
00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
questions for the testifiers through the
chair

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
and we want those questions to be actual
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
clarifying questions and not debate
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
we're not here to question them they're
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
on their logic we are here to further
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
understand why they are supporting this
 
00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.650 align:start position:0%
understand why they are supporting this
bill

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:08.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
when it's the executive session so later
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
on in the process is when you'll have a
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
time to say your piece
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
and when you might be prepared to make a
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
statement does anybody have any
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
questions about the distinction there
 
00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:23.870 align:start position:0%
questions about the distinction there
yes

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
so I just have a question about your
 
00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
statement that you make questions the
 
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:33.740 align:start position:0%
chair because I'm new to that I know
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
that in Edna you know
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
asked permission to ask a question but
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to say what the question
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
was yes that's exactly the same yes you
 
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
just but so we don't have 20 of us
 
00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:47.099 align:start position:0%
trying to ask questions all at the same
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
time you just go through the chair and
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
we'll I'll try to keep notes and he'll
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
keep me on top of things
 
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
um to make sure we we recognize everyone
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to make sure that we
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a situation where we find
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
ourselves debating with a presenter
 
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
because that's really not our place or
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
our place in a hearing is to listen to
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
the public and in our case we might also
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
be listening from experts from agencies
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear about that any
 
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
other questions on that process
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
there will also be a blue sheet where
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
people can register basically their
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
thoughts whether they are for the bill
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
or against the bill
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
and for folks that want to testify who
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
cannot be here there is a portal
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
that legislative Services has that they
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
can submit and of course everyone will
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
have access to our email addresses so
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
you'll be inundated with emails from
 
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
time to time so people educating you on
 
00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
their views on the bill
 
00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
forgot about that on are we
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
oh dear
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's okay something along
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
this line
 
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.109 align:start position:0%
this line
of

00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:47:06.119 --> 00:47:08.569 align:start position:0%
of
um

00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
that's okay but plenty of time to just
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
discuss this yes representative
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
self-worth just to double check my
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
understanding is this term
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
executive says there's going to be more
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
planned ahead we had kind of random ones
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
before that could just happen anytime so
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
that if they do it it's a big change
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to be as planful as
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
predictable as humanly possible
 
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
one thing I just want you to be aware of
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure representative almi is
 
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:40.220 align:start position:0%
aware of this sometimes we over schedule
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
time for hearing and then we find out
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
that we only needed five minutes and we
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
have an hour block of time
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
in a case like that if we've already
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there might be an
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
executive session that day we might
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
think it's a good time to
 
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
to exec some bills so we could open up
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
an executive session it would be more of
 
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
a time management thing than anything
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
but of course I'll consult with a
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
ranking member on that to see does that
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
make sense should we try to get that
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
done today especially on the less
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
controversial bills he said we'll use it
 
00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
as a time management tool
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
yes there we'd been
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
told that we shouldn't do unless we're
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone already
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
don't have very many bills
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
at least until the second committee
 
00:48:44.579 --> 00:48:45.410 align:start position:0%
at least until the second committee
built

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
built
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
right well and what's something I wanted
 
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
to talk to you a little bit briefly
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
about according to Ann Fitzgerald I
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've met her she runs
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
the committee services department and
 
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
she gave me an indication that she
 
00:48:59.809 --> 00:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
thought we'd have about 22 bills coming
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
to this committee which is actually
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
quite low
 
00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
we share this room with the criminal
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
justice committee
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
they think they're going to have 80
 
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.630 align:start position:0%
they think they're going to have 80
bills

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.069 align:start position:0%
bills
so

00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
we are sharing this room with them I've
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
talked I've talked to the chair and
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
we've agreed that Ways and Means will
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
have this room Monday Tuesday Wednesday
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
they will have it Wednesday Thursday
 
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.050 align:start position:0%
they will have it Wednesday Thursday
Friday

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
obviously using Wednesday as a wiggle
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
room day
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
we only have about nine bills in our
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
possession so there's only so much we
 
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
can do right now
 
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
and and just so you know the revenue
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
estimating usually doesn't start until
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
sometime in February
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
partly because a lot of the agencies are
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
very busy working with the governor
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
right now on his budget so they'll only
 
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
they'll have some availability but they
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
may not be able to give us all the
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
numbers quite yet however
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
I would love to start some agency
 
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
presentations in any other presentations
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
I've heard of a couple ideas already
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
that we can get early on to educate
 
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
ourselves so that we're ready
 
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
and we might do some Bill hearings early
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
on just to get them going
 
00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:20.099 align:start position:0%
um we probably won't have any executive
 
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
sessions for quite a while because we
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
have a lot of other work to do
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and we'll go through that in a little
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
bit more detail but you know I don't
 
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
want to get too far behind so I'll start
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
scheduling some stuff soon like for next
 
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.609 align:start position:0%
scheduling some stuff soon like for next
week

00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
but it's just for planning purposes next
 
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
week I do not believe we'll be here
 
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Thursday or Friday
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
that criminal justice will be in this
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
room we may be here Monday and Tuesday
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
depending on what we can schedule that
 
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.750 align:start position:0%
depending on what we can schedule that
soon

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
soon
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
so for planning purposes I hope that
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
helps someone asked me you know looking
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
ahead when do I make my doctor's
 
00:50:59.329 --> 00:50:59.339 align:start position:0%
appointments I think Thursday and Friday
 
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
are fairly safe in January
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
um obviously Thursday is going to be
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
important for session days but I don't
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
see us having a session day in January
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
or at least not to the very end because
 
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:14.180 align:start position:0%
none of the bills have exact none of the
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
hearings have gone through so we don't
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
have any exact sessions so we have
 
00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099 align:start position:0%
nothing to go to the house session so
 
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's for planning persons I think
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
Thursday Fridays are pretty open
 
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.490 align:start position:0%
right now
okay

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sure yes I know I mentioned uh
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
during our phone
 
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
we do not want you to get kicked off it
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
we'll try to be reasonable as best we
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
can but we do have deadlines so I want
 
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
to go over that a little bit so thank
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
you for the cue
 
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.809 align:start position:0%
you for the cue
um

00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
we are here to do good work but I don't
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
want to exhaust you
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
we'll try to get full days in so that
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
when you come here you know you're here
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
from let's say nine till four
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
try to fill in a full day uh obviously
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
with a lunch break as much as we can
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
I will work with representative all me
 
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
to try to determine how long we think
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
these hearings might be so we can plan
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
our time well and so that we're not
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
super surprised a lot of the bills that
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
we will hear will not be going to reps
 
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.250 align:start position:0%
we will hear will not be going to reps
Hall

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
Hall
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
um you know we'll be able to stay in
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
this room for a lot of it we'll be able
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
to plan a lot of this okay it go ahead
 
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.410 align:start position:0%
to plan a lot of this okay it go ahead
yes

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
oh representative thank you
 
00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:43.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
those that have to go to a second yes
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's unclear which bill is our second
 
00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.870 align:start position:0%
it's unclear which bill is our second
committee

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.510 align:start position:0%
committee
so

00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
hey uh do oh
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
um that really UPS the ante you've got
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
to get get those things
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
get them or oh maybe you could talk to
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
them absolutely thank you uh I don't
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
know of those yet the only indication we
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
have is what when we see it listed under
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
ways and means what the deadline is
 
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's the only indication that we know
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
because not all bills that have a fiscal
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
Note require a second committee that I
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
believe is determined by the speaker's
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
office and he works in concert with the
 
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
house Clerk
 
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't have any advance notice on
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
that beyond what you see on the general
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
court website as well right now I
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any indicated as second
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
committee bills but absolutely those
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
will be as soon as we see those we
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
should schedule those and get those
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
moving we also are a second committee
 
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
for other committees so if something
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
first goes to criminal justice let's say
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy it would then
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
potentially come to us for the tax side
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
of things so we'll end up with some more
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
bills that we don't know about yet if
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
um I've got as of last night or 11.
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
great and that
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
Foods one on
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
moving also sole Proprietors
 
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.210 align:start position:0%
moving also sole Proprietors
Tech

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
Tech
 
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:42.770 align:start position:0%
Tech
and

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.710 align:start position:0%
 
sponsor

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
okay great uh well we'll see if we can
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
what I guess I'm thinking is if we can
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
schedule some Bill hearings next week
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
Monday Tuesday
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe a pres presentation or two
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
so we'll mix them up a little bit we get
 
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
a little bit of both but I don't want to
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
get I think it's hard and you'll start
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
to see this tomorrow when we start to do
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
back to back presentations for eight
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
hours straight can be a little bit
 
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.089 align:start position:0%
hours straight can be a little bit
overwhelming

00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
overwhelming
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
so we'll try to break those up going
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
forward now so for the next two days
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
these are the economic briefings we do
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
together with the Senate Ways and Means
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
Committee to kind of kick off the year
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
these should be a very kind of high
 
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
macro level
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
in you know high level thinking about
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
what is happening in our agencies what
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
they see coming down the pike
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
nothing just really to give us an
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
overall indication of where they think
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
the economy is going so we'll hear from
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
the inside experts and then we'll hear
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
from the outside experts to get us
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
started and then we're gonna we'll keep
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
drilling down into more and more detail
 
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
and you will have plenty of spreadsheets
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
um do not feel like you have to memorize
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
anything you know really just absorb try
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
to absorb as much as you can just ask
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
questions get more and more comfortable
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
as we do the deeper and deeper dive we
 
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
won't actually put pen to paper on the
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates for probably six weeks
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
so we've got time
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
to be learning and thinking and asking
 
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
good questions and like I said if
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
there's something that we're not you're
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
not getting enough information on and
 
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.140 align:start position:0%
you want more information on
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
we'll get a presenter to come in or as I
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned Jennifer our researcher can
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
help us understand the history behind
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
some things as well
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
she has really good access to well what
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
are other states are doing what has been
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
the impact you know all that kind of
 
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
stuff she'll be able to help us with
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
that so any of those requests send my
 
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
way and we'll do the best we can
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay couple little decorum things
 
00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:53.579 align:start position:0%
um water is totally acceptable on the
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
table but really nothing else if you
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
don't mind
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
um the you know when it comes to using
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
your phone you obviously turn off the
 
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.370 align:start position:0%
your phone you obviously turn off the
ringer

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
ringer
 
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
um laptops we don't I don't mind if you
 
00:57:09.049 --> 00:57:09.059 align:start position:0%
have them on the table and I don't mind
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
if you use them because let's say a
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
topic comes up and you want to do a
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
little bit of research you want to read
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
the bill a little bit or you want to
 
00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
look at something that's absolutely fine
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
but what we don't want really in a
 
00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
public hearing is to have you glued to
 
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
your laptop and not listening to the
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
public right because that would be
 
00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
disrespectful and we want to make sure
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
people feel welcome and we appreciate
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
their time yes one exception hopefully
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
what's that I've got to type the stuff
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
off oh yeah yeah oh speaking of which
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
so uh representative Platt has
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
volunteered to be our committee clerk
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
that is awesome because usually the
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
chair has to go find someone to do that
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
it is a lot of work and we really
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate that because he's going to be
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
taking notes for all of us
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
for the record and we appreciate that he
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
will also be calling the role when it
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
comes time to take a vote during
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
any questions so far
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
all right deadlines so now for the
 
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
freshmen this is your Bible right here
 
00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
make sure you have your calendar and
 
00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:20.579 align:start position:0%
you're looking at it constantly
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
Jennifer and I will do our best to
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
communicate with you via emails but
 
00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:26.579 align:start position:0%
please keep checking these because we
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
don't want to miss something
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
the deadlines are right up front page
 
00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:33.950 align:start position:0%
the deadlines are right up front page
two

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
and this is what we're held to
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
so this is what we always have to be
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
paying attention to and I appreciate
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
your reminding me if we get close to
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
deadline and we haven't done something
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh so very importantly Thursday February
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
16th is the last day to report house
 
00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:53.579 align:start position:0%
Bills going to a second committee
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
so no later than that any of the bills
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
that are marked as a second committee
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
Bill have to have been exec from this
 
00:59:00.599 --> 00:59:01.849 align:start position:0%
Bill have to have been exec from this
committee

00:59:01.849 --> 00:59:01.859 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
I would strongly prefer not to get
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
backed up a tight against any deadlines
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have a little wiggle room
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna that's what we're going
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
to strive to do as soon as we have the
 
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.069 align:start position:0%
to strive to do as soon as we have the
bills

00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
gonna do the best we can
 
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.870 align:start position:0%
gonna do the best we can
yes

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
just ask
 
00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:21.770 align:start position:0%
just ask
Eric

00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
Eric
 
00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.329 align:start position:0%
Eric
on

00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
I was already talking
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.289 align:start position:0%
 
problem

00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
somebody looks at a municipal property
 
00:59:49.609 --> 00:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
on Bill and thinks oh that's the text
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
did not
 
00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.190 align:start position:0%
did not
property

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
at them
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
and on but there are also bills that end
 
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
okay I appreciate all of your eagle eyes
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
if you see anything like that so just
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
for the freshman's sake
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
usually if a bill has a an impact on the
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
budget or it has an impact on taxes or
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue there would be two committees
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
involved one would be the policy
 
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
committee the underlying policy and then
 
01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
the second one would be us if it had to
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
do with a tax or fee or Revenue impact
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
make sense so there are certain ones
 
01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
that will come to us only because we
 
01:00:55.809 --> 01:00:55.819 align:start position:0%
deal with that policy for example
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
cigars and cigarettes believe it or not
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
all comes to us I believe I don't think
 
01:01:02.289 --> 01:01:02.299 align:start position:0%
it ever goes to Commerce
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
and we have to deal with that sometimes
 
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
if it if it's not to do with the money
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
um I once ended up with a bill about on
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
putting the tobacco products that were
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
attractive to children behind the
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
counter and it went to Commerce
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
interesting well so it and the house
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
clerk really reads through all the bills
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
and tries to send them to the right
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
committee and they do a really
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
exhaustive read to you know look at the
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
rsas that are being impacted they do the
 
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
best job they can but we might have to
 
01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:38.579 align:start position:0%
give them some feedback along the way if
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
we see something go awry so yeah
 
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
and there is one other there are two
 
01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:44.650 align:start position:0%
and there is one other there are two
other

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:44.660 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
objectives in our committee description
 
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
one of them is to look out for the
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
treasury of the state which is very
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
Broad and the other one is dedicated
 
01:01:58.799 --> 01:01:59.930 align:start position:0%
Broad and the other one is dedicated
funds

01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
which historically ended up here because
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
I was the one that started doing
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
26 years ago I think it is now and on
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
make as much sense to people sometimes
 
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
as if it's about uh nursing
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund they think it should go
 
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
over to Health and Human Services or
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
something like that sometimes bills that
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
make more sense in the financial terms
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
to come here end up over there because
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
they are awfully busy when they're
 
01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:39.740 align:start position:0%
trying to assign these bills as you know
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
and they they can't know everything
 
01:02:43.319 --> 01:02:44.329 align:start position:0%
and they they can't know everything
either

01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:44.339 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that reminder we'll
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
go over that in more detail don't worry
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
about that yet but sometimes we have all
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
this Revenue coming in we think ah we've
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
got plenty of money and then we realize
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
well it's been dedicated to something
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
else so you'll learn more about that
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%

Laurie

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
Laurie
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
oh Madam chair
 
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.829 align:start position:0%
oh Madam chair

um
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
you talked about uh receiving emails and
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
I just wanted for the benefit of the
 
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.309 align:start position:0%
I just wanted for the benefit of the
freshman

01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
freshman
 
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
if it's a bill about speeding on Lake
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee you can expect now
 
01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh and I don't think there's any
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
obligation to save those from out of
 
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:35.690 align:start position:0%
obligation to save those from out of
state

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
you can that's what the delete button is
 
01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.170 align:start position:0%
you can that's what the delete button is
for

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.549 align:start position:0%
for
just

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
to the back of your mind other emails
 
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
that come to your legislative email
 
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
account are open to public records
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
requests uh if they go to the let dot
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
ledge email they are saved here
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
but if you have a private one that goes
 
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
through the dot ledge one they may or
 
01:03:59.809 --> 01:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
may not be so just keep that in the back
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
of your mind uh as a legislator anything
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
that does with legislation is open to
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
public records uh our public records law
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
so if you have a separate account for
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
legislative activities maintain that
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
just so you don't get in trouble with
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
that on on the ethics side
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
um just uh something to remember uh you
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
were talking about dedicated funds uh
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
and you're going to explain that later
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
that there are two types of dedicated
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
funds and fund funds and how they
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
operate and and that so we'll have a
 
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
deeper discussion of that it has
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
generally if I'm not stepping out of the
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
line been the policy of this committee
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
to look a scance at dedicated funds
 
01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
um that for a variety of reasons some
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
are very necessary
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
there's no question about it our
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative almie and former
 
01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative major spent a lot of time
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
taking a look at various dedicated funds
 
01:05:01.619 --> 01:05:03.349 align:start position:0%
taking a look at various dedicated funds
to

01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
figure out which ones should which one
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we had several dedicated funds
 
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
a couple of which were non-lapsing they
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
just had this huge amount of money that
 
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.490 align:start position:0%
just had this huge amount of money that
was

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
doing nothing
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
if we're going to collect the tax the
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
taxes got to do something
 
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
which is something that if I'm not
 
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
mistaken not speaking out term it's
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
something we need to take a look at a
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
tax does it do anything
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
and if it does something well then the
 
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
policy decision comes up from that
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
um and you're also going uh I would
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
suggest that we uh have somebody run
 
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
over this for the freshmen so that we
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
can uh understand
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
what uh your monthly Revenue focus is
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
you should be on the email list now if
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken yes you'll be getting a
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
daily uh Revenue uh statement as to how
 
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
much money is coming in but how much
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
money is coming in does it really mean
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
anything because it's how much money is
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
going out when
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
um if I'm not mistaken and that that
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
becomes more clear when when you read
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
this yeah so you were you received this
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
email over the weekend actually Chris
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
Shea was very busy uh the state of New
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire monthly Revenue Focus this is
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually produced by the department of
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
administrative services but incorporates
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
obviously information from the dra and
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
other agencies It's a Wonderful read and
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's beautiful graphs usually in
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
color which really is nice so this is a
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
real go-to I've been receiving this for
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
12 years I love it
 
01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
um and it we will have someone hopefully
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
go over this in more detail very soon
 
01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:42.299 align:start position:0%
we'll do a deeper dive on this for you
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
so you can ask questions okay awesome
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes do I have permission to give a
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
counter view to this idea that that
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
attacks may not do something
 
01:06:57.049 --> 01:06:57.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
a tax goes into the general fund or the
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or some other major
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
fund on a fee
 
01:07:10.569 --> 01:07:10.579 align:start position:0%
actually those are the only two I think
 
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
and a fee
 
01:07:16.329 --> 01:07:16.339 align:start position:0%
can easily be set up
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
that on sometimes
 
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
goes elsewhere than where it was
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
supposed to go and I have been fighting
 
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
on the dedicated fund committee for
 
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
quite a while now since we got our new
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
comptroller who thinks that that's okay
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
as long as the legislature wrote it into
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
all right to be continued on another
 
01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:39.980 align:start position:0%
date please
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
 
01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.270 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
chair

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask if maybe you could
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
take it up with a speaker or somebody
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
that at some point not right away if
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
there were some training related to
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
emails in the legislative
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
um the legislative emails because some
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
what I've been able to do is I identify
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
I put I made rules so I identified
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
certain recipient people who were
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
sending me an email I those
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
automatically get forwarded to my home
 
01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
account and then there are some emails
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
that I make go to a special folder
 
01:08:23.769 --> 01:08:23.779 align:start position:0%
because they're from the committee chair
 
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
and and there are other things that you
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
could do but I I just think that it
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
would be useful for people not right not
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
this week you know but when they start
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
to get into it there are a lot of things
 
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
that you can do with with that
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
legislative email account okay

01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
the first hallway take a right take a
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
right into the first and you're right
 
01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:33.769 align:start position:0%
right into the first and you're right
there

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
to your point representative fellows if
 
01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
I hear that there's a general need for
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
more training or more services or more
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
anything I would certainly speak to the
 
01:09:42.289 --> 01:09:42.299 align:start position:0%
speaker about that for you
 
01:09:42.299 --> 01:09:44.090 align:start position:0%
speaker about that for you
representative

01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you this is probably an elementary
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
question but just something I if we need
 
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
to talk about this offline I'm fine with
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
that but
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
um how does the Ways and Means Committee
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
obviously we're looking at revenue and
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
the money that's coming into the
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
treasury and the the what we're
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
collecting uh that's vital to the budget
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
writers because they have to know how
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
much they're working with how do we work
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
with is there a relationship that we
 
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
have with Finance the finance committee
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh do we communicate that with them uh
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
what is our is there a working
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
relationship with our committee and
 
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
those folks yes and no we have very
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
separate jobs
 
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh we provide the revenue estimates and
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
what we'll do once we we're going to
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
drill down we're going to take little
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
minor votes all along the way first
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
we'll start with some straw votes see
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
where we're at then we'll get more
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
specific then we'll get more serious and
 
01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
then we'll come up with a final final
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
resolution and we will present a house
 
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
resolution hopefully it's bipartisan
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
unanimous on what we believe our Revenue
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
estimates are and then that that's what
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
they will use now saying that
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
um this is something that will be
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
evolving I believe especially given the
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we're under and the
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
fact that we will have to produce those
 
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
numbers before we have very important
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
data from dra on business tax receipts
 
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
in April so we'll have to give it to
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
them but we might need to revise those
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
numbers as we know more but that is our
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
job is to provide that information to
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
finance and then they decide how to
 
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
spend it
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
good yeah did anyone have something else
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
over here
 
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.790 align:start position:0%
over here
questions

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
um we have some bills in front of us
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
already to cut this tax or that tax
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's great I like cutting taxes but
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
without the revenue impact and how it
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
affects the overall
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue stream I I I find it hard to
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
make a decision without putting a bigger
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
picture around it how do we get that we
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
will request well first of all we'll
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal impact statement so we
 
01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
will hear from dra their best kiss in a
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
static situation of what that impact
 
01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
will be and then of course we will hear
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know I know there's some lobbyists
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
here from some of the industry folks
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
hopefully they will present to us when a
 
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
tax cut bill or tax increase Bill comes
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
in they will let us know what they think
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
the impact will be and then we're going
 
01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:15.620 align:start position:0%
to have to bring our life experiences in
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
and figure it out and make our best
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
decision but we're a long way off from
 
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
that we'll also invite our researcher
 
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
maybe outside organizations to weigh in
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
give us their thoughts on what it all
 
01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.850 align:start position:0%
give us their thoughts on what it all
means

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
we'll have to find out yeah thank you
 
01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.430 align:start position:0%
we'll have to find out yeah thank you
yes

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
take a look for instance at HB 100
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is on the back
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
this is very frustrating but this is
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
what we get these days the first thing
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
is a chart that says we have no idea
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
and then it provides an analysis how
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
they got to trying to get some idea of
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
what it might do and then this year for
 
01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:11.300 align:start position:0%
the first time
 
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
on they are giving us on the back of
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
that first page of the fiscal note on
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
impact through to FY 28. we never had
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
anything but the existing and it doesn't
 
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
even if I remember if I think it doesn't
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
even have
 
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
on the prior year to take a look at
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
which makes things a little difficult in
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
on but this is really important for us
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
because we've passed a lot of bills that
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
say in this year it's going to do this
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
and that year it's going to do that the
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
other the third year it's going to kill
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
attacks altogether
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
and the third year is outside of the
 
01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:57.649 align:start position:0%
and the third year is outside of the
purview

01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
purview
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the previous fiscal notes
 
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
but on
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
it does it is does take a fair amount of
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
reading and then there is representative
 
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
ulery's unfavorite most point on table
 
01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
two static analysis
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
I actually would like to tell reps and
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
Valerie that
 
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
I had a minor concussion in the fall and
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
I forgot to put in the bill that was
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
actually going to start us towards a
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
place where maybe we could do some
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
non-static analysis
 
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
and but uh next year it will be here
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
but static analysis is all that we can
 
01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
really expect out of the Department of
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration they want to
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
cleave as closely as possible to facts
 
01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
what that means though is that they
 
01:14:59.570 --> 01:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
frequently give us analysis based on two
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
years prior when the audits are finished
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
on and then they try to think to
 
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.590 align:start position:0%
on and then they try to think to
estimate

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
where we'd ought to be today based on
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
and then they have to try to just
 
01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
continue to estimate on that basis
 
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
so for the future when you've got
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
something that might be a recession
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
coming up or you might already be in a
 
01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
little sludge of a recession in some
 
01:15:32.689 --> 01:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
industries that can be important
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
and so this is
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
going to be our job to try to
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
figure out how to interpret those but I
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
think it would be really helpful
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the person who needs to do
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
it was here this morning he can very
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
does a very good job of taking us
 
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
through these as does the commissioner
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
of Revenue
 
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
administer yes thank you representative
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
all me and uh representative Oliver
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
you're next but I just want to mention
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
I've already met with the commissioner
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
of dra and asked her to come see us
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
soon and more often than ever before and
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
her team to help us really drill down on
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
all of this and she has agreed to do so
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
so representative ulery yeah the
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner has a the commissioner has
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
a great deal of experience having
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
basically done it from the ground up
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
from the staff level to rising to being
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
in charge of everything so she has a
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
pretty good grasp of thing I think the
 
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative from Lebanon regarding
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
the uh static analysis uh just uh to
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
clarify the terminology static means
 
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
you've got this figure you've got this
 
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
figure you subtractor at them together
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
to come up with something but you the
 
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
only figure you know you have is as
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative only said two years old
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
so you're not doing anything current and
 
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
the state has not seen fit to rent
 
01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
Watson for a couple of days which would
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
cost more than our budget
 
01:17:07.199 --> 01:17:08.810 align:start position:0%
cost more than our budget
uh

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
but it would be nice if we had access to
 
01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
Watson to plan that out but uh I'm
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
looking forward to seeing your bill
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
because that that's one of the things
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
that we have to do is guesstimate and
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
our guesstimation is going to be
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
difficult in this environment with a
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
large amount of money floating around
 
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
doing something and further if I could
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you regarding the fees taxes and
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
fees are two separate things fees do
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
something taxes or taxes are just
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue generators but thank you for
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
that definition and I don't necessarily
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
disagree with your point Thank you madam
 
01:17:45.659 --> 01:17:46.970 align:start position:0%
disagree with your point Thank you madam
chair

01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you and back to deadlines uh and
 
01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.290 align:start position:0%
thank you and back to deadlines uh and
scheduling

01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
I think we'll start a little bit on the
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
slower side but plan it to ramp up as
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
we're getting to the later part of
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
January into February but we're going to
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
be busy in the house in general
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
through April 6 would just cross over
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay so keep that in mind
 
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
try not to plan any vacations until
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
after that please we're going to need
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
you here
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
we tend to generate a lot more bills in
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
the house than the Senate does go figure
 
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
so the right after crossover we get a
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
little reprieve because we have less
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
Senate bills coming over right so that's
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's when you can kind of plan on a
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of a deep breath but it's
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to ramp it's going to get busier
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
and busier because this is a budget year
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
so expect it to be busy in March okay
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
questions on that
 
01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.890 align:start position:0%
questions on that
awesome

01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
awesome
 
01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:54.659 align:start position:0%
all right what else do I have oh we've
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
had uh there's a chance that we could
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
also do field trips
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
I'll have to spark up my laptop for that
 
01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
but we had one lobbyist for a company
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
a request or offer that we could go
 
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
visit a company and learn more about the
 
01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:12.350 align:start position:0%
visit a company and learn more about the
industry

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
give me a moment and see if I can find
 
01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.189 align:start position:0%
give me a moment and see if I can find
it

01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
um this had to do I think with tobacco
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
let me see if I can find it
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
there was some Warehouse in Kentucky
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
does that sound familiar
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
now those are you know you don't have to
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
go you but it will help instruct you
 
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
when we start to see bills about that I
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
personally haven't seen any bills on
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
that topic yet but there may be some
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
um apologize let me see if my I can
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
McLean does that sound familiar yes
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
McLean is a distributor of many items
 
01:20:00.169 --> 01:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
sold in convenience stores this includes
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco and they would like to invite us
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
to do a tour of their facility
 
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
I believe members would benefit from
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
seeing how tobacco taxes are collected
 
01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
for the state as well as a first-hand
 
01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
look at a major distributor involved in
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
the supply chain supply chain so
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
kantukook is a suburb basically of
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
Concord it's only 10 15 minute drive so
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be I don't think it'd be too
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
burdensome for you uh what do you think
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
what do you guys think interested yes
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
could be fun
 
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.390 align:start position:0%
could be fun
okay

01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.050 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:41.209 align:start position:0%
 
from

01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:20:41.219 --> 01:20:42.430 align:start position:0%
from
yeah

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh if you haven't been involved in that
 
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.219 align:start position:0%
whole world it is eye-opening and
 
01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
something I don't know a lot about
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
um so I'm open to scheduling it and then
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
you can certainly if you're something
 
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
you want to do great if not no big deal
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative plett I think fairly
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
early on because then we could hit the
 
01:20:59.170 --> 01:20:59.180 align:start position:0%
ground smoking
 
01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:06.410 align:start position:0%
ground smoking
[Laughter]

01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
um another thing to mention for
 
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
scheduling is sometimes we will have a
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and then we won't do anything
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
about its exact session because it's not
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
complicated easy
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
other times especially when it comes to
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue stuff
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
we will do subcommittees
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee as a whole so we'll do
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
the initial public hearing and then
 
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
we'll come back and do a subcommittee of
 
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
the whole to really work through the
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
numbers okay so we're a little different
 
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
from some other committees which would
 
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
break out into like Commerce for example
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
breaks out into different three
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
different divisions and they do
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
subcommittees on just about everything
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
here we'll do more subcommittees of the
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
whole unless it's a very minute topic
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
and we can get three or four people to
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
just drill down on that issue
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
we've done it both ways there we've
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
definitely done subcommittees in the
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
sense of a smaller group to focus on
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
this that or the other thing that
 
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
seem to be amenable to
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
maybe constructive work by a smaller
 
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
group and that's worked well then we've
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
done those Committees of the whole uh so
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know whatever seems to fit uh I just
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention two other categories
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
one is uh there's I don't think this has
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
been mentioned but maybe it has with
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
we've got the monthly Revenue Focus
 
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that there have been
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
there are two other sources of data of
 
01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:49.100 align:start position:0%
Revenue data
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
that I receive and I think most people
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
on ways of means but from before
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
receiving I just I just want to be sure
 
01:22:59.570 --> 01:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
maybe Jen knows that everybody's going
 
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
to get this stuff uh one is from the dra
 
01:23:06.169 --> 01:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
and it starts in the middle of the month
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
and it's a more detailed source of
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
information about the revenue from the
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
business tax for example that there are
 
01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
estimated taxes
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
that have come in
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
and they're at this level
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
and you can see the last year in the
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
last year and the last of the previous
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
month and so forth there are refunds
 
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
that have been paid you get a sense of
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening on the refunds
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
you could start start to drill into
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the business taxes
 
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's a very good source document and uh
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
so I just want to be sure maybe you've
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
set it up or maybe Jen has or maybe it's
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
automatic I don't know but in past years
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
so let's make sure that everybody gets
 
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
that and then Chris uh
 
01:24:04.689 --> 01:24:04.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
daily presentation of aggregate revenues
 
01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
that he starts sending out about the
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
middle of the month from lbao
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
and that's just another way of checking
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
on what's Happening very useful so I I
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that that stuff
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
gets out absolutely I agree I believe I
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned that to the dra commissioner
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
already but I will make sure maybe
 
01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
Jennifer can help follow up with that
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
that we want both of those
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
two regular emails to go to every member
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
of this committee
 
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
double check yeah it is very very
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
valuable I agree did you have something
 
01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
else uh sorry representative Ames why
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
don't you go ahead and finish well it's
 
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
a different different category but uh I
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think uh this was mentioned but
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
I could have been daydreaming
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
um and that was uh the gambling side of
 
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
things we we have a
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
a policy and revenue responsibility for
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
all the gambling uh activities that are
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
allowed in New Hampshire and uh and that
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
has taken up a lot of time our time in
 
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
the past week we're the only committee
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
that understands these issues so I just
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
want to mention that and we may be
 
01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
consumed by it uh here now on the you
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
know as issues erupt uh in that Arena
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
they come to us I just wanted to mention
 
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.970 align:start position:0%
they come to us I just wanted to mention
that

01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you have
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
something else Dad no
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
no okay I representative Almy did you
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
have something to add yeah I just wanted
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
to say that that uh those documents that
 
01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
come especially the one from the dra
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
that comes out every day from the middle
 
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:05.219 align:start position:0%
of the month on you can get obsessed by
 
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
on you may get really upset on Tuesday
 
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
that we're way behind and then on
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
Wednesday they've made up a gap and
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
we're ahead on but what really matters
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
is the final day of the month because
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's the one that he's talking about
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
where you get the refunds you get the
 
01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:28.970 align:start position:0%
where you get the refunds you get the
um

01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
the on
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
tax payments and the estimates the tax
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
payments are on after you've get sent a
 
01:26:40.810 --> 01:26:40.820 align:start position:0%
letter and told you didn't pay this tax
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
or part of this tax
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so on it's the last day of that when
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
you get these huge charts and they're a
 
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
little hard to print out which is a
 
01:26:55.570 --> 01:26:55.580 align:start position:0%
problem I did get them to
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
start designing them so that they would
 
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
go on a legal piece of paper but if you
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
make them any smaller then you can't
 
01:27:07.129 --> 01:27:07.139 align:start position:0%
really see what you've printed out
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
so on
 
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.750 align:start position:0%
and then
uh

01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
I don't remember things very well
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
without writing them down anymore so I
 
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
don't remember what the one on the other
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
one that's okay we got plenty of time
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
and just don't panic guys I think
 
01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
there's gonna be a lot of information
 
01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:29.219 align:start position:0%
coming at you you do not need to
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
memorize it or anything like that look
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
for Trends just look for understanding
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
where things are going how they come in
 
01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
but don't get too worried food is here
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
but representative janigan did you have
 
01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.410 align:start position:0%
but representative janigan did you have
something

01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to add
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
something very quickly I know when I
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
first started looking at those daily
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
revenues and it would say you know maybe
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's the 20th of the month and you'd
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
look at it and it would say you know
 
01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
revenues are 20 million below
 
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
just realize that when you look at the
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
next day and more comes in that number
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
is going to go down and typically what
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing lately is by the end
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the month we've actually been running
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
a surplus now that may not continue but
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
just realize that number is only as of
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
that particular day so
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
this is a great stopping point for lunch
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%

01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:24.540 align:start position:0%

03:30:44.090 --> 03:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
so my section today for the presentation
 
03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
is to provide an overview of the New
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business profits tax
 
03:30:52.490 --> 03:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
also referred to as BPT
 
03:30:54.610 --> 03:30:54.620 align:start position:0%
we'll talk very high level
 
03:30:57.469 --> 03:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
about what the tax is who's subject to
 
03:31:00.889 --> 03:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
it and other facets of the BPT
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
so what is BPT BBT is an apportioned net
 
03:31:06.650 --> 03:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
income tax on business activity
 
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
conducted in New Hampshire at a rate of
 
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
7.6 percent for
 
03:31:14.929 --> 03:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
tax periods ending in 2022
 
03:31:19.969 --> 03:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
and 7.5 percent for tax periods in 2023
 
03:31:22.429 --> 03:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
so that's reducing one tenth of a
 
03:31:22.439 --> 03:31:22.900 align:start position:0%
so that's reducing one tenth of a
percent

03:31:22.900 --> 03:31:22.910 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:31:22.910 --> 03:31:24.110 align:start position:0%
percent

03:31:45.769 --> 03:31:45.779 align:start position:0%

03:31:50.330 --> 03:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
the filing threshold is a very recent
 
03:31:52.130 --> 03:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
increase from fifty thousand dollars
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
which was the filing threshold for 30
 
03:31:54.000 --> 03:31:58.429 align:start position:0%
which was the filing threshold for 30
years

03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:01.610 --> 03:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
C and S corporations Partnerships single
 
03:32:05.150 --> 03:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
member LLCs sole proprietorships
 
03:32:07.429 --> 03:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
for federal tax purposes are all New
 
03:32:10.370 --> 03:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers and are subject to
 
03:32:12.290 --> 03:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
the BPT tax
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
I will also note that there is no
 
03:32:14.040 --> 03:32:15.650 align:start position:0%
I will also note that there is no
requirement

03:32:15.650 --> 03:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
that the activity be a trade or business
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
that as identified under federal income
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
tax purposes and therefore may include
 
03:32:26.210 --> 03:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
residential and Commercial rental real
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
estate activities
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
if gross rents
 
03:32:32.929 --> 03:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
or in other income derived from the
 
03:32:35.330 --> 03:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
property exceed 92 000 the filing
 
03:32:35.340 --> 03:32:36.410 align:start position:0%
property exceed 92 000 the filing
threshold

03:32:36.410 --> 03:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
03:32:39.530 --> 03:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
so it's usually gross rents or if a
 
03:32:41.690 --> 03:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayer sells a property in the
 
03:32:41.700 --> 03:32:43.130 align:start position:0%
taxpayer sells a property in the
property

03:32:43.130 --> 03:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:32:45.170 --> 03:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
um obviously usually would have a gross
 
03:32:47.570 --> 03:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
proceeds over 92 000 that would make
 
03:32:49.370 --> 03:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
them subject to New Hampshire business
 
03:32:49.380 --> 03:32:52.670 align:start position:0%
them subject to New Hampshire business
tax

03:32:52.670 --> 03:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
to calculate the net business income New
 
03:32:55.969 --> 03:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire starts with the federal
 
03:32:57.769 --> 03:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
taxable income of the entity and then
 
03:32:59.630 --> 03:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
makes adjustments to that income based
 
03:33:01.370 --> 03:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
on certain income
 
03:33:03.830 --> 03:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
in deductions that differ in treatment
 
03:33:08.510 --> 03:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
from the IRS so pursuant to RSA 77 a
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
colon 1. New Hampshire has adopted the
 
03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code AS of a particular
 
03:33:16.610 --> 03:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
date for each taxable year the current
 
03:33:18.410 --> 03:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code version that is in
 
03:33:20.450 --> 03:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
effect right now is the code as of
 
03:33:23.269 --> 03:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2018.
 
03:33:25.309 --> 03:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
the version has not changed since the
 
03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute changed it as of
 
03:33:29.450 --> 03:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
1-1 2020.
 
03:33:31.790 --> 03:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
it includes the significant tax cuts and
 
03:33:34.610 --> 03:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
jobs Act of 2017.
 
03:33:36.710 --> 03:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
admin adjustments are necessary to
 
03:33:38.929 --> 03:33:38.939 align:start position:0%
account for the version of the Internal
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue code adopted by New Hampshire
 
03:33:44.330 --> 03:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
the most common adjustments that are
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
seen are one the amount of Section 179
 
03:33:50.210 --> 03:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
expense taken on a federal tax return
 
03:33:53.510 --> 03:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
if it is in excess of the amount Allowed
 
03:33:55.490 --> 03:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire and which is as of
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
today is five hundred thousand dollars
 
03:34:02.030 --> 03:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
for that's again Section 179 expense
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
another common adjustment is bonus
 
03:34:04.319 --> 03:34:05.870 align:start position:0%
another common adjustment is bonus
depreciation

03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
depreciation
 
03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
for assets placed in service during the
 
03:34:11.210 --> 03:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
year bonus depreciation is allowed
 
03:34:14.929 --> 03:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
federally under internal revenue codes
 
03:34:18.530 --> 03:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
8K but is not allowed at all for New
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire BPT purposes
 
03:34:24.530 --> 03:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
and then the third comment add back is
 
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
estate income tax base
 
03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:28.750 align:start position:0%
estate income tax base
taxes

03:34:28.750 --> 03:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
03:34:31.849 --> 03:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
we'll also see other adjustments that
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
aren't as common but so I'll just go
 
03:34:34.910 --> 03:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
over those really quickly
 
03:34:37.070 --> 03:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
adjustments for foreign dividends
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
consisting of guilty that were not
 
03:34:42.530 --> 03:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
previously subject to BPT and or foreign
 
03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
dividends consisting of
 
03:34:47.870 --> 03:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
deemed one-time repatriate repatriation
 
03:34:50.450 --> 03:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
under the tcga which is the tax cuts and
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
jobs act Kevin will speak more about
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
guilty later in the presentation
 
03:34:57.729 --> 03:34:57.739 align:start position:0%
other TCA
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
tcgaa related adjustments are business
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
interests deducted in excess of the
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
federal limitation and charitable
 
03:35:06.410 --> 03:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
deductions in excess of the federal
 
03:35:06.420 --> 03:35:08.030 align:start position:0%
deductions in excess of the federal
limitation

03:35:08.030 --> 03:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
and then finally a quite rare adjustment
 
03:35:13.729 --> 03:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
is the amounts deducted under the
 
03:35:16.130 --> 03:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
internal revenue codes section 181 which
 
03:35:17.809 --> 03:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
is a treatment of certain qualified film
 
03:35:20.750 --> 03:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
and television and live theoretical
 
03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:23.330 align:start position:0%
and television and live theoretical
Productions

03:35:23.330 --> 03:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
Productions
 
03:35:25.010 --> 03:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
so changes in the federal income tax
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
like what we've seen during the pandemic
 
03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
often brought State Conformity through
 
03:35:33.710 --> 03:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
legislature for example the PPP loan
 
03:35:35.330 --> 03:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
forgiveness that was received by most
 
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
was not taxable by federal statute
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
resulting from the cares act because New
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have a rolling
 
03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
Conformity with the Internal Revenue
 
03:35:44.760 --> 03:35:45.830 align:start position:0%
Conformity with the Internal Revenue
code

03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
special legislation was required to make
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
PPP loan forgiveness non-taxable to New
 
03:35:54.170 --> 03:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
another significant adjustment that is
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
quite unique to New Hampshire is

03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%

exceeds a safe harbor reasonableness is
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
often demonstrated through using
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue codes section 162 and
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
from there using a number of

in the prior years
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
the amount of the deduction however
 
03:37:37.250 --> 03:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
cannot be reduced below zero
 
03:37:38.929 --> 03:37:38.939 align:start position:0%
you might ask why the reasonable
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
compensation deduction isn't applicable
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
to C or S corporations and this is
 
03:37:45.469 --> 03:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
because the owners of these entities are
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
or are likely to be paid through a W-2
 
03:37:47.520 --> 03:37:49.070 align:start position:0%

03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
for the services that they have provided
 
03:37:53.450 --> 03:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
and therefore is already deducted from
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
the gross business income Partners
 
03:37:58.250 --> 03:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
members and Proprietors do not receive
 
03:38:01.070 --> 03:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
traditional W-2 wages and therefore the
 
03:38:02.889 --> 03:38:02.899 align:start position:0%
business expenses do not reflect
 
03:38:05.560 --> 03:38:05.570 align:start position:0%

in brief net operating losses each year
 
03:38:19.849 --> 03:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
are collected and used against future
 
03:38:22.969 --> 03:38:22.979 align:start position:0%
business profits a business can carry
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
forward an nol for a period of 10 years
 
03:38:28.729 --> 03:38:28.739 align:start position:0%
and a maximum of 10 million dollars
 
03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
this increase from one million dollars
 
03:38:33.650 --> 03:38:33.660 align:start position:0%

December 31st 2022 which is the filing
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
season we are heading into the deduction
 
03:38:45.410 --> 03:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
for nol is limited to the less lesser of
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
nol available or 80 percent of the
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
current year taxable income for BPT
 
03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
so for an example if a business was it
 
03:38:56.090 --> 03:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
has an nol available for prior years
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
totaling a hundred thousand dollars
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
and the current taxable year current
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
year taxable income is a hundred
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars the nol available to
 
03:39:08.330 --> 03:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
apply is eighty thousand dollars so
 
03:39:09.790 --> 03:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
eighty percent of the current year
 
03:39:12.410 --> 03:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
income this leaves twenty thousand
 
03:39:15.050 --> 03:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
dollars remaining of taxable income and
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars remaining of an
 
03:39:20.269 --> 03:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
nol carry forward to be used against a
 
03:39:23.510 --> 03:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:25.190 --> 03:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
um to close out I'll just make a brief
 
03:39:27.889 --> 03:39:27.899 align:start position:0%
mention of credits New Hampshire has
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
several credits that can be used to
 
03:39:31.190 --> 03:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
offset BPT
 
03:39:33.950 --> 03:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
the most common among businesses is the
 
03:39:36.769 --> 03:39:36.779 align:start position:0%
BET credit or some say often call it bet
 
03:39:36.779 --> 03:39:37.849 align:start position:0%
BET credit or some say often call it bet
credit

03:39:37.849 --> 03:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
credit
 
03:39:39.889 --> 03:39:39.899 align:start position:0%
the BET credit is generated through
 
03:39:43.010 --> 03:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax paid in the
 
03:39:45.530 --> 03:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
current year in the prior 10 years as it
 
03:39:47.870 --> 03:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
has a 10-year carry forward
 
03:39:49.969 --> 03:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
this leaves a perfect segue into the
 
03:39:52.250 --> 03:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
next section of our presentation as we
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
have Corey Reynolds come up um he's
 
03:39:57.590 --> 03:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
already here so talk to you about the
 
03:39:59.929 --> 03:39:59.939 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax
 
03:40:03.229 --> 03:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse me just one moment
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
a ton of information
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
fortunately as a business owner I have
 
03:40:10.010 --> 03:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
to deal with all these personally can we
 
03:40:11.570 --> 03:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
pause to see if people have questions
 
03:40:11.580 --> 03:40:12.769 align:start position:0%
pause to see if people have questions
absolutely

03:40:12.769 --> 03:40:12.779 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:40:17.690 --> 03:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:19.610 --> 03:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I had a
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
question on could you just explain what
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
bonus depreciation is sure so bonus
 
03:40:27.650 --> 03:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
depreciation is a federal
 
03:40:31.849 --> 03:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
um so under 168k allows a business to
 
03:40:34.969 --> 03:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
basically deduct the entire cost of a
 
03:40:36.650 --> 03:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
asset that's placed in service during
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
the year so if a business owner bought a
 
03:40:41.389 --> 03:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
tractor tractor cost seventy five
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars under regular
 
03:40:44.809 --> 03:40:44.819 align:start position:0%
depreciation they would depreciate that
 
03:40:47.090 --> 03:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
tractor typically over a five or seven
 
03:40:48.410 --> 03:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
year period
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
bonus depreciation allows them to allow
 
03:40:53.389 --> 03:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
to take it all in one year the Year of
 
03:40:56.330 --> 03:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
service and so New Hampshire says Nope
 
03:40:59.210 --> 03:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
and they so you would have in that case
 
03:41:01.969 --> 03:41:01.979 align:start position:0%
practitioners would carry you can still
 
03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
take it for federal purposes but New
 
03:41:06.170 --> 03:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would then deduct it over the
 
03:41:07.910 --> 03:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
five or seven year period depending on
 
03:41:10.190 --> 03:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
the life of the asset thank you you're
 
03:41:10.200 --> 03:41:11.630 align:start position:0%
the life of the asset thank you you're
welcome

03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you on many years ago now we had
 
03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
to deal with the Safe Harbor and the
 
03:41:29.570 --> 03:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
compensation deduction and at that time
 
03:41:33.050 --> 03:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
there were some major abuses going on I
 
03:41:36.889 --> 03:41:36.899 align:start position:0%
would like to know if the small
 
03:41:40.610 --> 03:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
businesses now feel that the the law is
 
03:41:42.769 --> 03:41:42.779 align:start position:0%
fair and the way it is being applied is
 
03:41:42.779 --> 03:41:45.110 align:start position:0%
fair and the way it is being applied is
fair

03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:48.769 --> 03:41:48.779 align:start position:0%
um speaking from my own experience it um
 
03:41:51.650 --> 03:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
I do think that it had a positive impact
 
03:41:53.929 --> 03:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
on practitioners and business owners
 
03:41:56.450 --> 03:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
being able to substantiate a
 
03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
compensation reduction at 75 000 or
 
03:41:59.040 --> 03:42:00.590 align:start position:0%
compensation reduction at 75 000 or
below

03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
below
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if anybody any of my
 
03:42:04.070 --> 03:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
peers behind me would like to comment
 
03:42:06.969 --> 03:42:06.979 align:start position:0%
but I yes I think that it has a general
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
positive effect on that
 
03:42:11.630 --> 03:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time I think we want
 
03:42:13.490 --> 03:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
to we do want to ask some questions but
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
we don't get too far on the weeds today
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
we can hopefully always ask you to come
 
03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
back absolutely okay great is that okay
 
03:42:21.530 --> 03:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
if we do you have a quick question
 
03:42:23.389 --> 03:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
quick one okay go ahead like any
 
03:42:25.809 --> 03:42:25.819 align:start position:0%
profession you have your acronyms what's
 
03:42:30.650 --> 03:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
tcja yes tcja is stands for the tax cuts
 
03:42:33.170 --> 03:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
and jobs Act of 2017 that the Trump
 
03:42:36.229 --> 03:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
Administration passed
 
03:42:41.150 --> 03:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:43.370 --> 03:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Michelle
 
03:42:43.380 --> 03:42:44.750 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Michelle
so

03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:47.690 --> 03:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
my name is Corey Reynolds I'm here from
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
Baker Newman noise I'm a senior manager
 
03:42:53.210 --> 03:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
there our firm works from a really mid
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
to large size businesses goes from a
 
03:42:59.750 --> 03:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
mid-sized developers you know up to
 
03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:00.910 align:start position:0%
mid-sized developers you know up to
multinational

03:43:00.910 --> 03:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
multinational
 
03:43:03.170 --> 03:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
operations that do business all over the
 
03:43:05.870 --> 03:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
world my personal Focus tends to be in
 
03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
the world of real estate development and
 
03:43:08.399 --> 03:43:09.969 align:start position:0%
the world of real estate development and
investment

03:43:09.969 --> 03:43:09.979 align:start position:0%
investment
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
today I'm here to talk to you about the
 
03:43:14.210 --> 03:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax which Michelle
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
did mention it really is a tax that runs
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
parallel to the business profits tax in
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
many ways so the business Enterprise
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
acts commonly referred to as bet or bet
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
is a 0.55 percent tax on the total
 
03:43:32.030 --> 03:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
dividends compensation and interest
 
03:43:34.610 --> 03:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
expense that's paid by an entity and
 
03:43:36.290 --> 03:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
we'll go into each of those factors just
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
to provide you a little bit of
 
03:43:40.130 --> 03:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
information and one key takeaway there
 
03:43:42.050 --> 03:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
is it is a tax based on these amounts
 
03:43:44.690 --> 03:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
paid by The Entity it's not a tax on
 
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
that income from operations
 
03:43:50.929 --> 03:43:50.939 align:start position:0%
for 2022 a business is subject to the
 
03:43:53.330 --> 03:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax if they have
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
gross business receipts of at least 250
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or they have that an
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Value base of 250 000 that
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Value base being the
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
combination of dividends compensation
 
03:44:10.370 --> 03:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
and interests for 2023 that 250 000
 
03:44:13.370 --> 03:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
threshold is going up to 281 thousand
 
03:44:13.380 --> 03:44:14.450 align:start position:0%
threshold is going up to 281 thousand
dollars

03:44:14.450 --> 03:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh starting through the factors so first
 
03:44:20.389 --> 03:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
talking about dividends so Dividends are
 
03:44:21.889 --> 03:44:21.899 align:start position:0%
not just what you would consider you
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
know stock dividends from publicly
 
03:44:25.969 --> 03:44:25.979 align:start position:0%
traded corporations but it's cash
 
03:44:29.150 --> 03:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
distributions from any entity of current
 
03:44:32.690 --> 03:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
or accumulated New Hampshire profits
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
um I think it's easiest to describe that
 
03:44:37.190 --> 03:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
just by providing a brief example of
 
03:44:38.809 --> 03:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
what that would look like so it's you
 
03:44:41.150 --> 03:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
know say year one of operations for
 
03:44:43.190 --> 03:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
business they have a hundred thousand
 
03:44:46.130 --> 03:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
dollars of net business profits and no
 
03:44:47.690 --> 03:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
cash is removed from the business they
 
03:44:49.490 --> 03:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
don't pay anything out to the the
 
03:44:49.500 --> 03:44:50.990 align:start position:0%
don't pay anything out to the the
members

03:44:50.990 --> 03:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:44:53.090 --> 03:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
then coming into year two they have 50
 
03:44:55.250 --> 03:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
another fifty thousand dollars of New
 
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire profit so at this point the
 
03:44:59.450 --> 03:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
accumulated New Hampshire profits is a
 
03:45:01.130 --> 03:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
hundred fifty thousand hundred year one
 
03:45:03.530 --> 03:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
fifty year two and say at the end of
 
03:45:06.290 --> 03:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
year two they distribute 125 000 to the
 
03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
members well at this point you're
 
03:45:11.090 --> 03:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
accumulated earnings is 150. you took
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
out 125. so that whole 125 was
 
03:45:16.130 --> 03:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
accumulated or current earnings so that
 
03:45:18.769 --> 03:45:18.779 align:start position:0%
125 is considered dividends for the
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
purposes of the business Enterprise tax
 
03:45:24.170 --> 03:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
then at that point you have 25 000 left
 
03:45:27.170 --> 03:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
of accumulated earnings so going into
 
03:45:29.090 --> 03:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
year three what does it look like if we
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
then make a distribution in excess of
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
that amount so say year three it's break
 
03:45:35.210 --> 03:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
even and we make forty thousand dollars
 
03:45:38.570 --> 03:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
in distributions well 25 000 of that is
 
03:45:40.610 --> 03:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
dividends for business Enterprise sex to
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
the extent of our accumulated earnings
 
03:45:45.050 --> 03:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
that are left and the remaining 15 would
 
03:45:46.670 --> 03:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
not be subject to the business
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax perhaps it's a return of
 
03:45:52.130 --> 03:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
capital or debt Finance return uh
 
03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
distribution something along those lines
 
03:45:57.170 --> 03:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next Factor
 
03:45:59.570 --> 03:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
compensation so compensation's a little
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
more straightforward and it will be your
 
03:46:05.570 --> 03:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
W-2 type compensation that you pay to
 
03:46:08.690 --> 03:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
your employees directors officers who
 
03:46:10.610 --> 03:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
whoever it might be
 
03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a few additions to
 
03:46:15.229 --> 03:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
there over that you know regular W-2
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
income subject withholding so those
 
03:46:20.150 --> 03:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
common additions would first be the
 
03:46:22.490 --> 03:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
employer contributions to retirement
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
plans so that's also subject to the
 
03:46:26.450 --> 03:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax and the
 
03:46:29.809 --> 03:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
compensation factor and then also as
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
Michelle mentioned the compensation
 
03:46:34.010 --> 03:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
deduction if any compensation deduction
 
03:46:35.450 --> 03:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
is taken on the New Hampshire return
 
03:46:38.510 --> 03:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's also considered compensation for
 
03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
the sake of business Enterprise tax
 
03:46:44.210 --> 03:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
moving on to the third and final Factor
 
03:46:46.370 --> 03:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
here so interest expense so interest
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
expense is exactly what you would expect
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing too creative here it's
 
03:46:52.969 --> 03:46:52.979 align:start position:0%
going to be your interest expense on
 
03:46:55.929 --> 03:46:55.939 align:start position:0%
mortgages loans V equipment loans
 
03:46:58.130 --> 03:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
shareholder loans whatever might be just
 
03:47:00.290 --> 03:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
normal interest expense paid in accrued
 
03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
during the year is that's part of that
 
03:47:02.340 --> 03:47:03.410 align:start position:0%
during the year is that's part of that
factor

03:47:03.410 --> 03:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
factor
 
03:47:05.330 --> 03:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
so if someone's subject to the tax you
 
03:47:07.090 --> 03:47:07.100 align:start position:0%
go through all three of those factors
 
03:47:11.570 --> 03:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
add them up apply the 0.55 rate and then
 
03:47:13.250 --> 03:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
you get your business Enterprise tax
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
liability for the year and Kevin will
 
03:47:17.389 --> 03:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
touch a little bit on some of the
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
considerations on a multi-state entity
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
and how that would change the
 
03:47:23.450 --> 03:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
apportionment of how much of your
 
03:47:26.210 --> 03:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax base is subject
 
03:47:28.250 --> 03:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
to tax within the state
 
03:47:31.190 --> 03:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
and going hand in hand which and we'll
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
we'll get back to how the business
 
03:47:34.490 --> 03:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax ties in with business
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
profit Stacks I'm going to take a quick
 
03:47:38.870 --> 03:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
run down through a lot of the credits
 
03:47:40.250 --> 03:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
that are available both with the
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax and with the profits tax
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so first one on the list r d tax
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
credit research and development and go a
 
03:47:50.030 --> 03:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
little bit more into depth on this one
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
just because it it tends to get a few
 
03:47:53.809 --> 03:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
more questions in a lot of ways it
 
03:47:56.030 --> 03:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
mirrors the federal tax credit for
 
03:47:57.889 --> 03:47:57.899 align:start position:0%
research and development where you're
 
03:48:01.010 --> 03:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
looking at a credit related to the
 
03:48:03.050 --> 03:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
expenses paid for improving business
 
03:48:05.870 --> 03:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
processes developing products patent
 
03:48:09.889 --> 03:48:09.899 align:start position:0%
software types of items like that often
 
03:48:12.050 --> 03:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
companies will hire a third party to
 
03:48:13.250 --> 03:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
come in and take a look at their
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
operations to determine how much of our
 
03:48:17.809 --> 03:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
operations are actually related to R D
 
03:48:19.370 --> 03:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
type activities
 
03:48:22.190 --> 03:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire purposes they just
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
focus on the wages so that any wages
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
related to R D and there's an
 
03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
application process so after determining
 
03:48:33.889 --> 03:48:33.899 align:start position:0%
how much in wages related to R D during
 
03:48:35.450 --> 03:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
the year that they're going to claim for
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
their Federal application well then they
 
03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
make an application to New Hampshire
 
03:48:41.210 --> 03:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
that says well here's the amount of
 
03:48:43.729 --> 03:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
wages we had related to R D and the
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
amount of credit we're applying for the
 
03:48:47.929 --> 03:48:47.939 align:start position:0%
amount of credit of being 10 percent of
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
those wages so if you had fifty thousand
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
dollars of r d wages you're putting in
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
an application to New Hampshire for five
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of credit
 
03:48:58.370 --> 03:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire does after you this
 
03:49:00.349 --> 03:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
application is filed is they only have a
 
03:49:01.790 --> 03:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
set pool of money that they're giving
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
out for the r d credit so I believe the
 
03:49:07.790 --> 03:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
number someone else can correct me if
 
03:49:09.769 --> 03:49:09.779 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong is about seven million dollars
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
is about the total pool of credit that's
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
available so based on the amount of
 
03:49:17.090 --> 03:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
applications they get how much credit is
 
03:49:20.330 --> 03:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
applied for each per each entity who
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
applied for an r d credit will then get
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
a proportional piece of what's available
 
03:49:26.690 --> 03:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
if there's more than seven million
 
03:49:28.969 --> 03:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
dollars of credit that would that were
 
03:49:31.490 --> 03:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
applied for
 
03:49:33.950 --> 03:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
one you know once after that's been
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
determined they receive a letter from
 
03:49:37.969 --> 03:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire dra just letting know
 
03:49:39.769 --> 03:49:39.779 align:start position:0%
here's how much credit you have you can
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
you can claim this credit on your tax
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
return and attach this letter saying how
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
much credit that we issued to you
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
go looking at some of the other credits
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to move through a lot of
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
these ones pretty quick so the koas
 
03:49:55.250 --> 03:49:55.260 align:start position:0%

credit this is also a credit based on
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
contributions to certain programs within
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
the state specifically for a qualified
 
03:50:34.250 --> 03:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
scholarship organizations insurance
 
03:50:36.650 --> 03:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
premium tax credit I don't think too
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
many of us here deal with that very
 
03:50:41.450 --> 03:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
often it's just related to certain uh
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
taxes paid by the insurance industry
 
03:50:47.389 --> 03:50:47.399 align:start position:0%
and then just last one I'll mention real
 
03:50:49.969 --> 03:50:49.979 align:start position:0%
quickly the CTE centers tax credit
 
03:50:52.130 --> 03:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical Education Centers
 
03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
this is similar to cdfa or the education
 
03:50:59.150 --> 03:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
credit I credit to businesses for
 
03:51:00.769 --> 03:51:00.779 align:start position:0%
contributions to those Career and
 
03:51:02.269 --> 03:51:02.279 align:start position:0%
Technical centers that's used for
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
salaries of apprentices
 
03:51:07.309 --> 03:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
so and then moving on to our our last
 
03:51:09.410 --> 03:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
credit here so looking at the business
 
03:51:11.570 --> 03:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax credit
 
03:51:13.130 --> 03:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
that can be used against the business
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
profit stack so tying really these two
 
03:51:18.410 --> 03:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
parallel tax systems together
 
03:51:20.809 --> 03:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
so each year once after that business
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
Enterprise taxes determined any amount
 
03:51:25.370 --> 03:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
of business Enterprise tax that's
 
03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
incurred during a year can be used as a
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
credit against any business profits tax
 
03:51:32.510 --> 03:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
that was incurred during the year
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
if you don't use all of your business
 
03:51:36.830 --> 03:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax credit that's created in
 
03:51:39.769 --> 03:51:39.779 align:start position:0%
a year that unused amount can carry
 
03:51:41.929 --> 03:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
forward up to 10 years to continue to
 
03:51:43.790 --> 03:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
offset business profits tax in future
 
03:51:43.800 --> 03:51:45.050 align:start position:0%
offset business profits tax in future
years

03:51:45.050 --> 03:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:51:47.389 --> 03:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
again I think it's easiest illustrated
 
03:51:49.849 --> 03:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
by just talking putting a few quick
 
03:51:52.490 --> 03:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
numbers on it and putting making an
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
example so let's say in year one a
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayer incurs fifty thousand dollars
 
03:52:00.590 --> 03:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
of the Enterprise tax and forty thousand
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
dollars of the profit sex
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
well they have
 
03:52:06.950 --> 03:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
they they've created fifty thousand
 
03:52:08.450 --> 03:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
dollars of business Enterprise tax
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
credit because of that fifty thousand of
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax so since they only have
 
03:52:15.530 --> 03:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
40 000 of business profits tax
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
their Porsche their business profits tax
 
03:52:20.450 --> 03:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
is reduced to zero and then there's ten
 
03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of Enterprise tax left
 
03:52:24.590 --> 03:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
though Enterprise tax credit left over
 
03:52:27.290 --> 03:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
so they'll have ten thousand dollars of
 
03:52:29.650 --> 03:52:29.660 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward for up to ten years
 
03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of that year really their tax
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
liability what their the cash that
 
03:52:35.690 --> 03:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
they're actually going to pay to the
 
03:52:39.250 --> 03:52:39.260 align:start position:0%
state is the fifty thousand dollar bet
 
03:52:42.650 --> 03:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
liability just that just the business
 
03:52:44.330 --> 03:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax liability that they
 
03:52:44.340 --> 03:52:45.410 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax liability that they
incurred

03:52:45.410 --> 03:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
incurred
 
03:52:47.929 --> 03:52:47.939 align:start position:0%
and just an example of what it looks
 
03:52:49.670 --> 03:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
like for the carry forward so then year
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
two okay we occur 50 000 in business
 
03:52:54.410 --> 03:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax again but it's more
 
03:52:56.090 --> 03:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
profitable year so we had ninety
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in the profits tax
 
03:53:01.190 --> 03:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
so our net business profit sacks after
 
03:53:03.950 --> 03:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
we apply our Enterprise credits is gonna
 
03:53:06.170 --> 03:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
be thirty thousand dollars as we have
 
03:53:08.090 --> 03:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
the ninety thousand dollars of profits
 
03:53:10.490 --> 03:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
tax we have the fifty thousand dollars
 
03:53:14.090 --> 03:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
in current year bet credits from the BET
 
03:53:15.950 --> 03:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
pay this year and the ten thousand
 
03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
dollars of credit that we carried
 
03:53:19.190 --> 03:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
forward from the prior year
 
03:53:22.490 --> 03:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
then our bet and our Enterprise tax is
 
03:53:24.530 --> 03:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
still fifty thousand dollars
 
03:53:26.809 --> 03:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
so overall your tax liability what
 
03:53:28.370 --> 03:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
you're actually paying in cash to the
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
state is that fifty thousand dollars of
 
03:53:32.809 --> 03:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Tax Plus your thirty thousand
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
dollars of net business profit Stacks a
 
03:53:37.010 --> 03:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
total of eighty thousand
 
03:53:39.530 --> 03:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
and that's all all for me right now
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
unless we have any quick questions I'll
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'll pass it on to Kevin
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
03:53:49.250 --> 03:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh Mike the one
 
03:53:51.889 --> 03:53:51.899 align:start position:0%
thing you mentioned about r d is that
 
03:53:54.410 --> 03:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
the businesses only take salary
 
03:53:54.420 --> 03:53:56.030 align:start position:0%
the businesses only take salary
percentage

03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's r d related or is there more to
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
it as and if this building was an r d
 
03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
Center could they write this off or a
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of it so for New Hampshire
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
purposes all you can claim is the wages
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the federal level
 
03:54:15.410 --> 03:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there's many more expenses
 
03:54:17.809 --> 03:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
that can become that can be claimed but
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just focuses on New
 
03:54:22.610 --> 03:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wages related to the r d that
 
03:54:25.849 --> 03:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
was including the federal application
 
03:54:28.790 --> 03:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you madam chair we
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
will drill down on all of these a little
 
03:54:33.530 --> 03:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
bit more especially with the dra so any
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
other quick questions clarification yes
 
03:54:35.279 --> 03:54:36.950 align:start position:0%
other quick questions clarification yes
representative

03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:38.689 --> 03:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a quick
 
03:54:41.330 --> 03:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
question on the the carry forward the
 
03:54:42.769 --> 03:54:42.779 align:start position:0%
way you described it makes complete
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
sense my question is who's who's
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
tracking it are you depending on the for
 
03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
example a business has a 10-year carry
 
03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
forward in year one and year two that
 
03:54:54.050 --> 03:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
might be more carried forward year three
 
03:54:56.570 --> 03:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's reduced in year four at some point
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
how do you know where the 10 years ended
 
03:55:00.769 --> 03:55:00.779 align:start position:0%
for each is it up to the business to
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
track that or are you guys tracking that
 
03:55:06.410 --> 03:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of it's a with within
 
03:55:08.030 --> 03:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
the tax forms that are filed with the
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dra each year it does
 
03:55:13.070 --> 03:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
report how many CR how how much credit
 
03:55:15.530 --> 03:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
is left that was earned in each of the
 
03:55:18.290 --> 03:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
prior years so each year that carry
 
03:55:19.849 --> 03:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
forward schedule is provided to the
 
03:55:19.859 --> 03:55:20.689 align:start position:0%
forward schedule is provided to the
state

03:55:20.689 --> 03:55:20.699 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:39.170 --> 03:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:55:40.729 --> 03:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start my timer so I don't
 
03:55:42.110 --> 03:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
go long because I tend to be a little
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
long-winded and I get all jazzed up
 
03:55:45.650 --> 03:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
about this stuff so
 
03:55:48.290 --> 03:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
my name is Kevin Kennedy I'm a
 
03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
CPA I have been for about 30 years in
 
03:55:52.189 --> 03:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
this great state of New Hampshire I'm
 
03:55:53.809 --> 03:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
one of the managing Partners at my firm
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
Maloney and Kennedy I'm also a New
 
03:55:59.150 --> 03:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Society of CPA's board member
 
03:56:01.849 --> 03:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
and the other co-chair of its tax and
 
03:56:04.429 --> 03:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
legislative committee currently I'm also
 
03:56:06.889 --> 03:56:06.899 align:start position:0%
a member of the legislative committee on
 
03:56:09.050 --> 03:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
potential worldwide reporting for New
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a a bill which was introduced
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
by representative Schoenberg so so far
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
they've discussed New Hampshire taxation
 
03:56:19.370 --> 03:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
of businesses this part of the
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
presentation is to comment on topics
 
03:56:24.530 --> 03:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
including what needs to be considered
 
03:56:27.229 --> 03:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
when an entity is conducting business in
 
03:56:30.590 --> 03:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
more than one state and if it has a
 
03:56:33.410 --> 03:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
multiple State filing requirement how do
 
03:56:35.769 --> 03:56:35.779 align:start position:0%
you allocate the profit of that entity
 
03:56:38.510 --> 03:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
among the states that they have to file
 
03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
in beyond that we'll talk about what
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
considerations might be needed when you
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
have separate businesses that are
 
03:56:47.929 --> 03:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
commonly owned or have some sort of
 
03:56:50.330 --> 03:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
common control and whether or not they
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
need to file some sort of combined tax
 
03:56:55.130 --> 03:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
return together and lastly I will touch
 
03:56:56.809 --> 03:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
base on some items with regards to
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
foreign entities that have a connection
 
03:57:01.849 --> 03:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire taxpayers
 
03:57:04.790 --> 03:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
so in this realm of multi-state Taxation
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
the first term I'd like to bring forth
 
03:57:11.389 --> 03:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
is Nexus now Nexus roughly defined is
 
03:57:14.929 --> 03:57:14.939 align:start position:0%
the requisite contact between a taxpayer
 
03:57:17.809 --> 03:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
and a state before the state has
 
03:57:22.370 --> 03:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to tax the taxpayer meaning
 
03:57:24.889 --> 03:57:24.899 align:start position:0%
when does a taxpayer have sufficient
 
03:57:27.650 --> 03:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
presence within a state to make them
 
03:57:30.410 --> 03:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
subject to that states taxing rules and
 
03:57:33.950 --> 03:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
regulations now generally if a entity
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
has a physical presence in a state you
 
03:57:37.849 --> 03:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
have Nexus physical presence being you
 
03:57:39.410 --> 03:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
have employees there you have property
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
there maybe you go into the state or or
 
03:57:43.610 --> 03:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
you lease property there
 
03:57:46.849 --> 03:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
however many states expand the
 
03:57:49.370 --> 03:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
definition of nexus Beyond physical
 
03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
presence including New Hampshire to
 
03:57:53.929 --> 03:57:53.939 align:start position:0%
something that looks roughly like if
 
03:57:55.729 --> 03:57:55.739 align:start position:0%
you're doing enough business in our
 
03:57:58.309 --> 03:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
state then you've got a form of Nexus
 
03:58:00.170 --> 03:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
here this is often referred to as
 
03:58:03.530 --> 03:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
economic Nexus which is different than
 
03:58:05.469 --> 03:58:05.479 align:start position:0%
physical Nexus
 
03:58:09.170 --> 03:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
so the one hurdle that states have
 
03:58:12.889 --> 03:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
relative to economic Nexus is what's
 
03:58:17.809 --> 03:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
known as a public law 86 272 and this
 
03:58:20.990 --> 03:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
law says it prohibits a state from
 
03:58:23.990 --> 03:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
imposing a net income tax on a seller's
 
03:58:26.510 --> 03:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
business if the taxpayer activity is
 
03:58:28.969 --> 03:58:28.979 align:start position:0%
limited in that state to just the
 
03:58:31.070 --> 03:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
solicitation of orders so if a business
 
03:58:32.689 --> 03:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
is an out-of-state business and all
 
03:58:34.969 --> 03:58:34.979 align:start position:0%
they're doing is is soliciting orders in
 
03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
a state this law says you don't have
 
03:58:39.469 --> 03:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
Nexus in the state this state can impose
 
03:58:42.290 --> 03:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
its income taxation on that particular
 
03:58:42.300 --> 03:58:43.250 align:start position:0%
its income taxation on that particular
business

03:58:43.250 --> 03:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
now in recent history this public law
 
03:58:48.650 --> 03:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
has undergone various challenges to its
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation many of you might have
 
03:58:52.729 --> 03:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
heard this back in 2008 there was the
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
South Dakota versus Wayfair decision and
 
03:58:57.229 --> 03:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court essentially said
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
instead of physical Nexus for sales tax
 
03:59:03.290 --> 03:59:03.300 align:start position:0%
not income tax sales tax purposes we're
 
03:59:06.349 --> 03:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
actually going to use an economic Nexus
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
policy meaning that if an out-of-state
 
03:59:12.530 --> 03:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
entity vendor is shipping stuff to a
 
03:59:14.750 --> 03:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
state and they have enough presence
 
03:59:16.490 --> 03:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
economic presence not necessarily
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
physical presence within a state that
 
03:59:21.349 --> 03:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
state has the right to require this
 
03:59:23.330 --> 03:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
entity to collect and remit sales tax
 
03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
over the state and I know currently and
 
03:59:27.170 --> 03:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
in the past there has been some
 
03:59:29.630 --> 03:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
legislation here relative to this
 
03:59:31.010 --> 03:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
particular issue and the ability for
 
03:59:31.020 --> 03:59:32.710 align:start position:0%
particular issue and the ability for
out-of-state

03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
out-of-state
 
03:59:35.750 --> 03:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
agencies to tax in state and I'm not
 
03:59:37.490 --> 03:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
going to get into that right now but I'm
 
03:59:38.929 --> 03:59:38.939 align:start position:0%
just letting you know where where Public
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
Law comes into play here also this
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
public law 86 2 72 has been interpreted
 
03:59:48.290 --> 03:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
to apply only to the sale of tangible
 
03:59:51.290 --> 03:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
goods real stuff hard stuff not
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily the sales of services and
 
03:59:56.870 --> 03:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
intangible goods so given all this
 
03:59:59.570 --> 03:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
relative to Nexus that's the the first
 
04:00:01.969 --> 04:00:01.979 align:start position:0%
layer that a business has to consider do
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
they have a Nexus in a state and if the
 
04:00:06.889 --> 04:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
answer is yes we do then likely they
 
04:00:09.229 --> 04:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
have a filing requirement within that
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
state once they've determined that the
 
04:00:13.969 --> 04:00:13.979 align:start position:0%
next step is my next term in this Arena
 
04:00:15.769 --> 04:00:15.779 align:start position:0%
which is called apportionment which has
 
04:00:17.210 --> 04:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
been used already
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
and apportionment generally refers to
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
the formula used by a state to determine
 
04:00:24.830 --> 04:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the business's net
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
income is allocable to it and is taxable
 
04:00:30.889 --> 04:00:30.899 align:start position:0%
how do you apportion the pie among the
 
04:00:32.450 --> 04:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
states to determine what's what's
 
04:00:35.389 --> 04:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
taxable now previously New Hampshire and
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
Most states applied a three-factor
 
04:00:38.750 --> 04:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
apportionment thing that you looked at
 
04:00:41.450 --> 04:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
property they looked at sales they
 
04:00:42.889 --> 04:00:42.899 align:start position:0%
looked at compensation and the
 
04:00:44.570 --> 04:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
percentages of these numbers within a
 
04:00:46.849 --> 04:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
state to the total were used to in a
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
formula to determine the bottom line
 
04:00:50.570 --> 04:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
apportionment or percentage that was
 
04:00:52.969 --> 04:00:52.979 align:start position:0%
taxed in a particular state
 
04:00:54.769 --> 04:00:54.779 align:start position:0%
many States including New Hampshire
 
04:00:57.110 --> 04:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
recently have moved to looking at just
 
04:00:58.910 --> 04:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
sales for this apportionment
 
04:01:02.090 --> 04:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
consideration as a matter of fact this
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
single sales effect in New Hampshire
 
04:01:07.250 --> 04:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
started this year in 2022 and you're
 
04:01:09.170 --> 04:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
probably wondering and probably we don't
 
04:01:10.969 --> 04:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
know the answer yet what's the effect on
 
04:01:13.490 --> 04:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue by moving to single sales and
 
04:01:15.410 --> 04:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
the answer is well it just ended like
 
04:01:17.809 --> 04:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago we don't really know what
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
that is yet and I I would be very
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
curious to see if Department of Revenue
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually has enough information at this
 
04:01:26.570 --> 04:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
point to provide that and of course
 
04:01:28.370 --> 04:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
nothing simple in the world of Taxation
 
04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
and there's lots of complications
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
relative to apportionment for instance
 
04:01:35.630 --> 04:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
what's denotes a sale and where did it
 
04:01:35.640 --> 04:01:36.650 align:start position:0%
what's denotes a sale and where did it
occur

04:01:36.650 --> 04:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
occur
 
04:01:39.290 --> 04:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
so many states New Hampshire included
 
04:01:42.469 --> 04:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
have laws and regulations defining how
 
04:01:44.450 --> 04:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
to interpret this where where did the
 
04:01:46.370 --> 04:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
sale occur where should that sale be
 
04:01:48.650 --> 04:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
apportioned now for tangible property
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
often a sale would be considered in the
 
04:01:52.849 --> 04:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
state where the product was delivered or
 
04:01:55.490 --> 04:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
potentially it would be where the title
 
04:01:57.290 --> 04:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
of the property exchanged hands every
 
04:01:59.809 --> 04:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
state has their own rules New Hampshire
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
addresses this by saying regardless of
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
the conditions of the sale we don't care
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
what the the terms of the sales are fob
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
shipping point or whatever wherever the
 
04:02:10.189 --> 04:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
product is delivered if it's delivered
 
04:02:12.349 --> 04:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's apportioned to
 
04:02:15.650 --> 04:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
this state now the only hurdle that New
 
04:02:17.210 --> 04:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might have with this is again
 
04:02:19.490 --> 04:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
that public law and Nexus issue which is
 
04:02:21.650 --> 04:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
if it's determined that state doesn't
 
04:02:23.689 --> 04:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
that entity doesn't have Nexus in New
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire may not be able
 
04:02:27.950 --> 04:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
to tax the delivery the delivery of
 
04:02:29.570 --> 04:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
those goods in this state
 
04:02:31.550 --> 04:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
relative to the sale now that's tangible
 
04:02:33.229 --> 04:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
property relative to the sales of
 
04:02:33.239 --> 04:02:34.150 align:start position:0%
property relative to the sales of
services

04:02:34.150 --> 04:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:02:36.590 --> 04:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
historically Most states applied what
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
was known as cost of performance and
 
04:02:40.729 --> 04:02:40.739 align:start position:0%
cost of performance said wherever the
 
04:02:43.130 --> 04:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
work was done to to provide that service
 
04:02:44.990 --> 04:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's the sale that's where the sale
 
04:02:47.570 --> 04:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
was apportioned but recently two years
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
ago New Hampshire moved to what's known
 
04:02:52.130 --> 04:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
as market-based sourcing and
 
04:02:53.809 --> 04:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing which many many
 
04:02:56.090 --> 04:02:56.100 align:start position:0%
states have are now applying means
 
04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
whoever whatever state received the
 
04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
benefit wherever the customer was for
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
that service wherever that state is that
 
04:03:06.050 --> 04:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
they reside that's where you apportion
 
04:03:08.030 --> 04:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
the sale so I'll give you a quick
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
example graphic design person in New
 
04:03:11.570 --> 04:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gets hired by a Massachusetts
 
04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
company and they're going to pay him ten
 
04:03:15.229 --> 04:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to come up with a logo
 
04:03:16.729 --> 04:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
they do it and they ship it down to
 
04:03:16.739 --> 04:03:17.650 align:start position:0%
they do it and they ship it down to
Massachusetts

04:03:17.650 --> 04:03:17.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
that was a service creating that logo
 
04:03:23.330 --> 04:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
now under the New Hampshire market-based
 
04:03:25.370 --> 04:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
sourcing rules and Massachusetts has
 
04:03:27.050 --> 04:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
this rule as well they both say that's
 
04:03:30.050 --> 04:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
that's a Massachusetts sale because does
 
04:03:32.150 --> 04:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
the benefit for that service happened in
 
04:03:34.969 --> 04:03:34.979 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and these are new and very
 
04:03:36.769 --> 04:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
very complex I'm just hitting a very
 
04:03:38.210 --> 04:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
high level
 
04:03:40.729 --> 04:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
so now we've addressed the issues of
 
04:03:42.590 --> 04:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
Nexus we've addressed the issues of
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
apportionment the next issue is what if
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of companies that have
 
04:03:49.010 --> 04:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
some sort of common ownership or common
 
04:03:51.769 --> 04:03:51.779 align:start position:0%
control some states require you to
 
04:03:53.570 --> 04:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
combine these companies together when
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
you report because they don't want you
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
setting up different companies and
 
04:03:59.689 --> 04:03:59.699 align:start position:0%
shipping income off to other states they
 
04:04:02.090 --> 04:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
want a Level Playing Field so this is
 
04:04:05.389 --> 04:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
referred to as a unitary filing and
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
right now New Hampshire has unitary
 
04:04:09.769 --> 04:04:09.779 align:start position:0%
filing and they require companies that
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
meet the definitions of having companies
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
that have enough common ownership or
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
control to include all those entities on
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
the return and apply the apportionment
 
04:04:20.809 --> 04:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
across all the entities but the entities
 
04:04:24.650 --> 04:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
are only up to the United States borders
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
and it's referred to as Water's Edge
 
04:04:28.130 --> 04:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
once you hit the water
 
04:04:29.929 --> 04:04:29.939 align:start position:0%
you're no longer going to include any
 
04:04:32.530 --> 04:04:32.540 align:start position:0%
other companies in this unitary filing
 
04:04:35.210 --> 04:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
so it has to be a U.S company to be
 
04:04:37.130 --> 04:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
included in the unitary filing the
 
04:04:38.809 --> 04:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
committee that I'm currently on is
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the other side of things
 
04:04:42.650 --> 04:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
which would be worldwide reporting so
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
you've got foreign entities that maybe
 
04:04:47.150 --> 04:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
have a relationship or ownership of from
 
04:04:48.889 --> 04:04:48.899 align:start position:0%
within the U.S or New Hampshire company
 
04:04:52.130 --> 04:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
owns it or individuals do and they
 
04:04:54.650 --> 04:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
potentially you would include the income
 
04:04:57.769 --> 04:04:57.779 align:start position:0%
from those entities on the New Hampshire
 
04:04:59.809 --> 04:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
return When You're reporting if we move
 
04:05:01.610 --> 04:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
to worldwide reporting
 
04:05:03.530 --> 04:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
uh and that's what partly what this
 
04:05:05.150 --> 04:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee is is investigating and
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
researching is what what are the pros
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
and cons of moving to that
 
04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
um the uh the last item I will comment
 
04:05:13.859 --> 04:05:14.990 align:start position:0%
um the uh the last item I will comment
on

04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:05:17.389 --> 04:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
um relative to foreign entities is the
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
tax cut and jobs act which was mentioned
 
04:05:22.010 --> 04:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
before created a new level of foreign
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
taxation it used to be that foreign
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
taxes uh the only time foreign income
 
04:05:29.150 --> 04:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
became taxable in the US is when the
 
04:05:31.309 --> 04:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
money was repatriated it came back from
 
04:05:33.650 --> 04:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
the foreign country into the U.S the
 
04:05:35.929 --> 04:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
guilty tax which stands for Global
 
04:05:39.229 --> 04:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
intangible low tax income was attacked
 
04:05:41.809 --> 04:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
by the tax cutting jobs act that said
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know what if the conditions meet
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
certain criteria that foreign income has
 
04:05:49.370 --> 04:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
to be reported on the federal return and
 
04:05:50.750 --> 04:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
you get certain deductions and you get
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
certain credits but you still report it
 
04:05:55.130 --> 04:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
on the federal return the last budget
 
04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
time the New Hampshire budget was done
 
04:05:59.330 --> 04:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
it was put into place that New Hampshire
 
04:06:01.490 --> 04:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
would take half of that guilty income
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
and include it on the business profits
 
04:06:07.130 --> 04:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
tax return so New Hampshire is get is
 
04:06:09.889 --> 04:06:09.899 align:start position:0%
saying to some degree a level of foreign
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
income being included on the business
 
04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
profits tax return now we're still
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
investigating how that is going to
 
04:06:16.969 --> 04:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
affect if we move to a worldwide
 
04:06:19.450 --> 04:06:19.460 align:start position:0%
reporting module instead of Water's Edge
 
04:06:22.490 --> 04:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
but it's all part of the factors
 
04:06:24.769 --> 04:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
considered as we move through and my 10
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
minutes are up I know it was an awful
 
04:06:28.729 --> 04:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
lot to take on I spoke very very quickly
 
04:06:29.929 --> 04:06:29.939 align:start position:0%
because I didn't want to miss anything
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
because I get really jazzed about this
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
stuff did I say that already and thank
 
04:06:36.530 --> 04:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:38.450 --> 04:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
that was excellent thank you any quick
 
04:06:38.460 --> 04:06:40.010 align:start position:0%
that was excellent thank you any quick
questions

04:06:40.010 --> 04:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:06:42.290 --> 04:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
no let's keep going thank you
 
04:06:44.769 --> 04:06:44.779 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say he's guilty
 
04:06:48.530 --> 04:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.290 --> 04:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
did you have so go ahead
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
inside unders as as I remember on we
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
and we don't really know what it's done
 
04:07:08.110 --> 04:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.050 --> 04:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
oh you I'm not aware of the results yet
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
I think we might have put feelers out to
 
04:07:15.650 --> 04:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue but I'm not
 
04:07:16.610 --> 04:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
sure they have enough information
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
compiled yet either
 
04:07:18.479 --> 04:07:19.670 align:start position:0%
compiled yet either
foreign

04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:07:22.490 --> 04:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
all right Madam chair and esteemed
 
04:07:31.969 --> 04:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
Representatives my name is Karen LaSalle
 
04:07:34.370 --> 04:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
I am a partner with plodzik and
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
Sanderson here in Concord New Hampshire
 
04:07:38.410 --> 04:07:38.420 align:start position:0%
and we now have an office in Manchester
 
04:07:41.090 --> 04:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
and as Robin noted I'm the chair
 
04:07:43.010 --> 04:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
currently of the New Hampshire Society
 
04:07:45.769 --> 04:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
of CPAs and we are so happy to be here
 
04:07:48.349 --> 04:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
today with you and it's so great to see
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
such a robust Committee in in so many
 
04:07:53.330 --> 04:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
new members today so it's really great
 
04:07:55.490 --> 04:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
to be able to give this update on the
 
04:07:58.250 --> 04:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
new taxes they have put me at the end
 
04:08:00.050 --> 04:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
here just in case people were sleeping
 
04:08:02.809 --> 04:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
we wanted to wake you up with some a
 
04:08:04.729 --> 04:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
little bit easier taxes if that says
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
anything about my intelligence versus
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
Kevin but I'm going to be covering the
 
04:08:11.090 --> 04:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax so probably
 
04:08:13.790 --> 04:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
one that you've heard of a little bit
 
04:08:16.490 --> 04:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
easier of attacks I will say
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
um on on a number of levels the the last
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
one I'll cover at the very end so
 
04:08:24.530 --> 04:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax is for really
 
04:08:28.610 --> 04:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
any Resident of New Hampshire who or
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
it's been a resident for the year or
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
part of a taxable period it's for gross
 
04:08:36.290 --> 04:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends from all sources
 
04:08:38.809 --> 04:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
that exceed two thousand four hundred
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
dollars for individual filers single
 
04:08:44.150 --> 04:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
filers or four thousand eight hundred
 
04:08:47.210 --> 04:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
dollars for married individuals filing a
 
04:08:51.290 --> 04:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
joint tax return during a taxable period
 
04:08:54.290 --> 04:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
for Partnerships LLCs and associations
 
04:08:57.290 --> 04:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
The Entity has to have non-transferable
 
04:08:59.689 --> 04:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
shares to be subject to the interest in
 
04:09:03.110 --> 04:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
dividends tax again the gross interest
 
04:09:05.450 --> 04:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
in dividend income is two thousand four
 
04:09:07.010 --> 04:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars during the taxable
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
period and that has really been the
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
threshold for quite a long time the
 
04:09:13.790 --> 04:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
usual place of business is in New
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for these entities and any
 
04:09:19.610 --> 04:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
partner trustee member or owner is an
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
inhabitant or Regis resident of New
 
04:09:22.319 --> 04:09:23.630 align:start position:0%
inhabitant or Regis resident of New
Hampshire

04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
for Estates the estate of a deceased
 
04:09:28.490 --> 04:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
person who was a resident of New
 
04:09:30.170 --> 04:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for any part of the taxable
 
04:09:32.929 --> 04:09:32.939 align:start position:0%
period in the gross interest or dividend
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
again exceeds the twenty four hundred
 
04:09:35.399 --> 04:09:37.010 align:start position:0%
again exceeds the twenty four hundred
dollars

04:09:37.010 --> 04:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:09:40.429 --> 04:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
so when looking at what is taxable we
 
04:09:43.070 --> 04:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
actually the Department of Revenue has
 
04:09:45.050 --> 04:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
come up with these really great kind of
 
04:09:47.330 --> 04:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
cheat sheets what is taxable what is not
 
04:09:49.070 --> 04:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
taxable and if you're ever interested in
 
04:09:50.809 --> 04:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
looking you know you can look up
 
04:09:52.809 --> 04:09:52.819 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends
 
04:09:55.250 --> 04:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
checklist they have them for the
 
04:09:57.410 --> 04:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax as well which is
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
really great they I'm not sure if we
 
04:10:01.490 --> 04:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
have one for a business profits tax but
 
04:10:03.050 --> 04:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
it's a really great checklist of what is
 
04:10:05.929 --> 04:10:05.939 align:start position:0%
and what is not taxable so I won't bore
 
04:10:07.250 --> 04:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
you kind of with the details of
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
everything that's taxable and not
 
04:10:11.450 --> 04:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
taxable but your typical interest that's
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
taxable your bank interest credit unions
 
04:10:18.110 --> 04:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
your bonds municipal bonds except for
 
04:10:21.110 --> 04:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
those bonds that are from New Hampshire
 
04:10:23.210 --> 04:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
um interest that's not taxable New
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State and New Hampshire
 
04:10:26.750 --> 04:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
municipal bonds individual retirement
 
04:10:29.929 --> 04:10:29.939 align:start position:0%
plans Keo plans New Hampshire Housing
 
04:10:31.849 --> 04:10:31.859 align:start position:0%
Authority bonds those are all not
 
04:10:31.859 --> 04:10:33.170 align:start position:0%
Authority bonds those are all not
taxable

04:10:33.170 --> 04:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
dividends again your typical Bank
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
dividends corporate dividends items that
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
aren't taxable dividends that come from
 
04:10:44.170 --> 04:10:44.180 align:start position:0%
capital gains returns from Capital
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
liquidating dividends sailor exchanges
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
from transferable shares again I'm just
 
04:10:52.610 --> 04:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
hitting on some of the key
 
04:10:55.250 --> 04:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
um major ones that I tend to see you
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
know so I don't want to bore you with
 
04:10:59.150 --> 04:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
the whole list again it's a long list
 
04:11:01.729 --> 04:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
um so so know that there's there's quite
 
04:11:03.769 --> 04:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
a few areas that fall into taxable and
 
04:11:03.779 --> 04:11:06.290 align:start position:0%
a few areas that fall into taxable and
non-taxable

04:11:06.290 --> 04:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
non-taxable
 
04:11:08.809 --> 04:11:08.819 align:start position:0%
the exemption there's the exemption that
 
04:11:10.670 --> 04:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
I talked about which is also the filing
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
threshold of the two thousand four
 
04:11:14.450 --> 04:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars but there's also a
 
04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
couple other exemptions in New Hampshire
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
so a one thousand two hundred dollar
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
exemption available for residents aged
 
04:11:24.110 --> 04:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
65 years of age or older
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
a one thousand two hundred dollar
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
exemption for residents who are blind
 
04:11:31.490 --> 04:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
regardless of their age
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
and then there's a one thousand two
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar exemption for disabled
 
04:11:38.090 --> 04:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
individuals who have not yet reached
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
the due date of the return is this um
 
04:11:47.450 --> 04:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
same it follows the 1040 due date so
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
it's the fourth month the 15th day of
 
04:11:52.729 --> 04:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
the fourth month so typically what we
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
think of as April 15th uh depending on
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
when that day Falls
 
04:11:59.450 --> 04:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
so I think one of the major things
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
though that you need to know about the
 
04:12:03.650 --> 04:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax right now the
 
04:12:07.070 --> 04:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
tax is currently five percent but it is
 
04:12:10.929 --> 04:12:10.939 align:start position:0%
set to be repealed so for
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
2022 the tax is 5 for 2023 it is four
 
04:12:18.889 --> 04:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
percent and it's going to go down each
 
04:12:20.050 --> 04:12:20.060 align:start position:0%
year so
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
2024 it's 3 25 it's 2 26 it's one and
 
04:12:31.309 --> 04:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
then as of 2 1 1 2027 the tax has been
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
repealed so the IND tax is going away I
 
04:12:38.030 --> 04:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
do not know myself I don't know Kevin or
 
04:12:39.469 --> 04:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
if we've heard
 
04:12:41.330 --> 04:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
um in our talks with the dra with the
 
04:12:43.670 --> 04:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact of that is I don't
 
04:12:45.170 --> 04:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:12:47.210 --> 04:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
um personally but but I do know that
 
04:12:49.849 --> 04:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
that tax has been set to be repealed in
 
04:12:49.859 --> 04:12:52.429 align:start position:0%
that tax has been set to be repealed in
2027.

04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
2027.
 
04:12:57.110 --> 04:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
so this brings us to the the part of oh
 
04:13:01.849 --> 04:13:01.859 align:start position:0%
you do have a question representative
 
04:13:03.769 --> 04:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
fellows okay yeah I just wanted to know
 
04:13:05.689 --> 04:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
I see that most of you have been reading
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
something can are those available to us
 
04:13:10.849 --> 04:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
to read or
 
04:13:13.490 --> 04:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
we did not prepare formal handouts I
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
think I do you mind I don't we did not
 
04:13:18.290 --> 04:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
prepare formal handouts
 
04:13:20.330 --> 04:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
maybe we could ask them to come back
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with actual
 
04:13:24.830 --> 04:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
legislation or Revenue estimates to come
 
04:13:26.809 --> 04:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
back and maybe hand out some stuff then
 
04:13:28.490 --> 04:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
because right now we're doing the quick
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
again we're going to start high level
 
04:13:31.490 --> 04:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to have people come back
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to drill down
 
04:13:34.969 --> 04:13:34.979 align:start position:0%
you know so we'll start high level but
 
04:13:36.290 --> 04:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
maybe next time you could have something
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
you could share with us because we're
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
taking copious notes but there's a lot
 
04:13:44.210 --> 04:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
to cover here so representative Almy
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you one thing one thing we have to
 
04:13:50.210 --> 04:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
remember about them is the closer that
 
04:13:54.050 --> 04:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
we get to March and then April the list
 
04:13:58.750 --> 04:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
and I I I was wondering
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
on I never really thought of the
 
04:14:07.370 --> 04:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends taxes anything
 
04:14:09.410 --> 04:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
except interest in dividends until
 
04:14:12.410 --> 04:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
fairly recently when the dra started to
 
04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
throw in our faces that there is
 
04:14:17.570 --> 04:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
something called distributions yes which
 
04:14:22.729 --> 04:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
is quite large part of the tax and how
 
04:14:25.610 --> 04:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
how does distributions fit into your
 
04:14:27.050 --> 04:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
description of what you were telling us
 
04:14:27.060 --> 04:14:27.889 align:start position:0%
description of what you were telling us
about

04:14:27.889 --> 04:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:14:30.769 --> 04:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
so the the distributions it depends on
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
the type of entity and distributions on
 
04:14:37.370 --> 04:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
entities that have non-transferable
 
04:14:37.380 --> 04:14:38.769 align:start position:0%
entities that have non-transferable
shares

04:14:38.769 --> 04:14:38.779 align:start position:0%
shares
 
04:14:41.929 --> 04:14:41.939 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of entity are
 
04:14:45.170 --> 04:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
taxable as interest and dividends tax in
 
04:14:46.969 --> 04:14:46.979 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
04:14:46.979 --> 04:14:49.010 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
and

04:14:49.010 --> 04:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:51.530 --> 04:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
s corporations for instance they're
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
taxable no matter what and correct me if
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong Kevin because I'm saying this
 
04:14:56.090 --> 04:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head s corporations
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
they are taxable regardless
 
04:15:01.610 --> 04:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
entities that are like llc's limited
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
liability corporations limited liability
 
04:15:04.199 --> 04:15:05.330 align:start position:0%
liability corporations limited liability
companies

04:15:05.330 --> 04:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
companies
 
04:15:07.969 --> 04:15:07.979 align:start position:0%
who elect to be taxed as as corporations
 
04:15:12.050 --> 04:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
who have non-transferable shares are not
 
04:15:14.330 --> 04:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
taxed as interest in dividends so
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
there's some nuances so it depends on
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
the original entity structure and how
 
04:15:21.469 --> 04:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
it's set up and then ultimately on how
 
04:15:22.729 --> 04:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
it's taxed
 
04:15:25.130 --> 04:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
we do have a question
 
04:15:27.469 --> 04:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative good
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
so you're not talking about rmds you're
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
shared distributions
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
distributions yeah well the word
 
04:15:37.010 --> 04:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
distribution is in there just trying to
 
04:15:37.020 --> 04:15:39.110 align:start position:0%
distribution is in there just trying to
clarify

04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
so our rmds have to do with required
 
04:15:43.189 --> 04:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
minimum distributions which are
 
04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
distributions from retirement plans
 
04:15:46.729 --> 04:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
these are not the kind of distributions
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking to within companies
 
04:15:51.170 --> 04:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
distributions from a company often are
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
either dividend distributions or draws
 
04:15:56.809 --> 04:15:56.819 align:start position:0%
like a sole proprietorship who may take
 
04:15:58.670 --> 04:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
a distribution from his company or
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
partnership that may take a distribution
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
from their company and that wouldn't
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily be labeled a dividend
 
04:16:07.370 --> 04:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
because they are simply taking the
 
04:16:08.809 --> 04:16:08.819 align:start position:0%
income out of the company that
 
04:16:10.370 --> 04:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
potentially they've already been taxed
 
04:16:13.370 --> 04:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
on but under the rules and regs and the
 
04:16:15.710 --> 04:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
definitions certain entities
 
04:16:18.769 --> 04:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
particularly llc's when if the entity
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
has a non-transferable share a
 
04:16:22.070 --> 04:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
non-transferable means you can't easily
 
04:16:24.830 --> 04:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
sell the interest in the company those
 
04:16:26.689 --> 04:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
distributions under the current ranks
 
04:16:29.090 --> 04:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
and rules for a limited liability
 
04:16:32.150 --> 04:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
company are not considered dividends for
 
04:16:34.429 --> 04:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax but if
 
04:16:36.830 --> 04:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's not an LLC and it's a C Corp or an
 
04:16:39.050 --> 04:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
S corp and there is a distribute
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
solution it's likely to be labeled a
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
dividend distribution subject to the
 
04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
personal interest and dividends tax I
 
04:16:47.689 --> 04:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
hope that clarified it
 
04:16:49.490 --> 04:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very very helpful quick
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that the
 
04:16:53.630 --> 04:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
threshold for filing IND taxes hasn't
 
04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
changed in a while do you know when how
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
long it's been the 24-48 I think it was
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
1200 for the longest time I've been here
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
probably the longest I think I remember
 
04:17:06.889 --> 04:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
when it was 1200 and I think it's been a
 
04:17:09.290 --> 04:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
decade or more since since it's been
 
04:17:10.849 --> 04:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
changed I think it's been 2 400 it's
 
04:17:13.130 --> 04:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
2400 per person The Joint return is 4
 
04:17:15.710 --> 04:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
800 but I think it's been over a decade
 
04:17:18.650 --> 04:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
since I've seen it change and maybe two
 
04:17:20.349 --> 04:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:17:22.189 --> 04:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative Almy mentioned that
 
04:17:23.689 --> 04:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
you'll be getting busier and busier with
 
04:17:26.450 --> 04:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
your practices so I appreciate that uh
 
04:17:28.729 --> 04:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
so if you have the bandwidth to put your
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
notes into sort of an outline of things
 
04:17:32.330 --> 04:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't mind sharing with
 
04:17:34.610 --> 04:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
committee members that would be helpful
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to disturb you
 
04:17:37.370 --> 04:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to earn your living
 
04:17:40.370 --> 04:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
but uh that I think we all learned so
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
much today and we appreciate your being
 
04:17:44.210 --> 04:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
here and would love to have those notes
 
04:17:46.189 --> 04:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
handy when we go back to those topics I
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't Envision I'll have to do some
 
04:17:49.750 --> 04:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
spell checking but
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
other than that I'm happy to compile uh
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
my notes I imagine our my parents we
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it provide them too
