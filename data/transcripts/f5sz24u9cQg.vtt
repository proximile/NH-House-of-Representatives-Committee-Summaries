thank you again and good morning
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
i am representative deborah desimone i
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
represent rockingham county district 14
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to introduce my bill this
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill provides that the court shall not
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
issue an order in a divorce proceeding
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
that infringes on a party's
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
unless the court determines there is no
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
less restrictive means to achieve a
 
00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.870 align:start position:0%
less restrictive means to achieve a
compelling

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
compelling
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that this bill has
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
been brought forward
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
is uh because there uh
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
is a need
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the temporary relief and
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
permanent restraining orders issued in a
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
divorce proceeding
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we want to make it a more fair
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
field of play as it were and i'm not
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
taking it
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
lightly it is a very serious situation
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
so with that i will ask
 
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.550 align:start position:0%
so with that i will ask
representative

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
belanger to allow
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
mr j markell
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
who assisted me in writing this
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
is my mute
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
my button working here can you hear me
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
we can hear you mr markell
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh the basis
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
for this bill is is that it's to remedy
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
we view here
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
as a couple of stat key statutory
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
problems that exist in the divorce
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
statute and the companion bill which is
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
4.95 it might be
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
there because the remedy is the same and
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
the defect in the statute is the same
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
let me explain
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at rsa 458 16 section one
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
what we do is we have we have a grant of
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
authority which disregards the federal
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
and state constitution it allows
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
a family court judge to disregard the
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitutions the way
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
it's being interpreted let me explain
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
and give you a concise overview it says
 
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.069 align:start position:0%
and give you a concise overview it says
uh

00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
45816 says after the filing of a
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
petition for divorce annulment or
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
separation or decree of nullity the
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
superior court now obviously that's
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
family court today okay may issue orders
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
with such conditions and limitations as
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
the court deems just and may at the
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court be made on a
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
temporary or permanent basis uh then it
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
goes on
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh we have the same basically the same
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
tracking language in rsa 468 461 a10
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
the problem here is is that and this is
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
a solution for an existing problem is is
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
that it conveys
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
many courts are reading this as a uh
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
basically a license to do whatever they
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
want to do without regard to uh constant
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
without regard to the limits on the
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
constitution that are placed
 
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
constitution that are placed
um

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
by the way what this bill does is is
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
that it deals with a compelling
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
government interest let me explain
 
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
government interest let me explain
um

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to issue equitable orders
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
does actually come up against the
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitutions
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
people do not surrender all of their
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights merely because
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
they there is a petition for divorce or
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
a parenting petition filed now
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
let's be clear
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
this exempts
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
domestic violence petitions
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
because there's a compelling government
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
interest in protecting victims of
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violence there is uh and
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
protecting children and this also does
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
not apply to abuse or neglect petitions
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
this does not apply to anything else
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
like that it also does not apply
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily to parenting orders and the
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
reason why is because this bill says
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
that it applies to enumerated rights
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
under the federal and state
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
constitutions so it is a strict
 
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.269 align:start position:0%
constitutions so it is a strict
limitation

00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh you have a you have constitutional
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
rights to parent which are found which
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
arise within the constitution but they
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
are not enumerated rights and you
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
impliedly waive that when you file
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
basically a parenting petition or a
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
petition for divorce particularly where
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
there are children involved because then
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
the state can assert a compelling
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
interest in seeing that children are
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
protected the state can also uh assert a
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
compelling government interest in seeing
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
that parties are protected so what
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
importantly what this doesn't do
 
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.430 align:start position:0%
importantly what this doesn't do
it

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
lets courts issue orders that protect
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
people okay it does not it does not
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
disturb that at all
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
uh you know anti-harassment orders are
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
still in place domestic violence orders
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
are still in place courts have broad
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
general discretion to do anything they
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
to do anything within reason that will
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
be a sustainable exercise of discretion
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
by the way it's worthy of note when you
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
look at restraining orders particularly
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
under rsa 468
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
458-16 when we're talking about um
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
entering premises and things like that
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh staying away from people's work which
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
is the same thing under rsa 468 a10
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
what is not
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
what is not a restriction within the
 
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.549 align:start position:0%
what is not a restriction within the
statute

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
is entering some is entering a house of
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
worship so in other words the statutes
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
actually do impliedly recognize the
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
first amendment which is that you have a
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
right of freedom of worship
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
so what we're merely saying with this
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
is that the court is still free to craft
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
individual remedies that address the
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
needs of a case
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
what it just says is
 
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
is is that if you intend to infringe on
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
a constitutional right which is already
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
identified within the constitution all
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're saying is
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
your honor
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
please identify the right that is being
 
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.270 align:start position:0%
please identify the right that is being
infringed

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
infringed
 
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.310 align:start position:0%
infringed
uh

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
tell us why this is necessary to achieve
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
a compelling government interest
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
and tell us why
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
there is no less restrictive way of
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
achieving this compelling government
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
interest and just make written findings
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's all you really have to do
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
um it's no burden on the court it
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
clarifies things it also puts parties on
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
notice as to uh
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
what what people can do and what they
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
can't do there seems to be a widely held
 
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.870 align:start position:0%
can't do there seems to be a widely held
misconception

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
misconception
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
that somehow
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
there is a family law exception to the
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitutions
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
there is not
 
00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:05.909 align:start position:0%
there is not
okay

00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
while the constitution does not come
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
into play as often as it does in say
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.630 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
nevertheless

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
we do have these rights
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh once again
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
this is not a domestic violence statute
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
all it does this is not this does not
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
infringe on the rights of victims it
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
still protects victims it just says to
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
the court let's apply the law and that
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
there are constitutional limitations so
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
you can view this as curative
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
what it does is that it really just
 
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.710 align:start position:0%
what it does is that it really just
clarifies

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
what the court's discretion is and that
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
court's discretions have limitations um
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
now one of the things i did earlier this
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
morning was i
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
emailed the committee not only a copy of
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
the two statutes so it can read it but i
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
emailed a copy of the shack decision
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
which came out of
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts supreme judicial court
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
which deals with the first amendment
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
and it talks about prior restraint and
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
it gives a good overview of how
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
important rights are um and this is in
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
the family law context so for example
 
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.990 align:start position:0%
the family law context so for example
um

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
can you just so for example in our
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
parenting plans we say
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
you can't if you're a parent disparage
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
another parent in front of that child
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
and that's gonna stand and the reason
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
why it's good law is because the state
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
has a compelling government interest in
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
seeing children not being emotionally
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
damaged by a by a parent uh denigrating
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
another parent in the child's presence
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to stand up that's fine
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
these are just some examples now from
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
the real world let's look at whether or
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
not this is simply a solution looking
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
for a problem
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
well i can tell you that i'm just one
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
person and over the last 18 months
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
i have received orders outside of the
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
restraining order context because note
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
that this statute not only applies to
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
restraining orders but all orders the
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
reason it's in the harassment statute is
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the restraining order statute is
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
because that's where you may find a lot
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
of violations to occur but please note
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
that it applies to all orders so for
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
example when you have two bickering
 
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.070 align:start position:0%
example when you have two bickering
parents

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
and they don't seem to be able to arrive
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
at anything should a court order prior
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
restraint by saying something like the
 
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.270 align:start position:0%
restraint by saying something like the
parties

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
may not discuss
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
prior issues
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
may not be must be non-sarcastic
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
civil and forward-looking in their
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
discussions now
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
that became an order of the court
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
outside of a restraining order now
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
that is what's called prior restraint
 
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
that is what's called prior restraint
which

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
gets very strict scrutiny under the
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitutions and
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
under irrelevant u.s supreme court law
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
and that's why i've got the shaq
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
decision down there for you so you can
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
read it and get kind of a better handle
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
on how courts view this uh the new
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court also deals in
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
prior restraint which is basically a
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
form of censorship
 
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.630 align:start position:0%
form of censorship
okay

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
we come down in this society as against
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
censorship in most all circumstances
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough while many of the
 
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough while many of the
violations

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
violations
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
would probably be of the first amendment
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
type freedom of speech things like that
 
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.430 align:start position:0%
type freedom of speech things like that
nevertheless

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
i had one which actually violated the
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
eighth amendment to the federal
 
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
constitution and um
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
article 18
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire constitution
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
in a situation where
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
a man was taxed
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
alimony and child support in excess of
 
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
alimony and child support in excess of
100

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
100 of his income
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
now um
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the background on this
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
the man agreed committed domestic
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
violence and he went to jail
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay no question he did wrong but the
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
court in an independent order
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay for alimony after first finding out
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
he had no ability to pay alimony
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
nevertheless decided to change its
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
course and direction
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
and actually taxed him alimony to a
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of his income and i
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
think you would find in the orders it
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
was a strong consideration that he had
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
committed some domestic violence when we
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out to the court that this was a
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
violation of the eighth amendment which
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
was at that time in 2019
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
made applicable to the states for
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
excessive fines
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
and by the way which already existed in
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire under the excessive fine
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
statute under the excessive fines
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
constitution under the new hampshire
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendment they actually re they actually
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
backed the court actually backed away
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
from the order
 
00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:19.590 align:start position:0%
from the order
now

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
i have another case
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
where in the restraining order context
 
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.269 align:start position:0%
where in the restraining order context
uh

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
a court issues an order that says the
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
parties may only communicate
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
through parenting applications through a
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
parenting application such as talking
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
parents now that is fine because that's
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
a legitimate time place and manner
 
00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:43.350 align:start position:0%
a legitimate time place and manner
restriction

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay and courts can do that with no
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
problem and they don't get strict
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
scrutiny but
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
the court said they may only discuss
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
parenting issues
 
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.029 align:start position:0%
parenting issues
now

00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
the client in this particular case had a
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
very good lawsuit against the other
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
party because of destruction of property
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
and a few other things
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
under that under that court order he
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
can't even settle a case without being
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
settled for contempt
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
and by the way contempts in the state of
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you know do a couple of
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
things number one is is that they stain
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
a person's court reputation
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh they may trigger attorney's fees
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
number three in extreme cases you can be
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
sent to jail now
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
carry this one step further
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
supposing somebody and by the way please
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
be aware
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
the power to contempt
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
and order to jail is within the
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
so can you imagine engaging in otherwise
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
first amendment and new hampshire
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
protected speech
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
one minute please
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay non-threatening non-harassing
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
and can you imagine being sent to jail
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
on something like that so what this does
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
is this cures the existing defect that
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
exists in the two statutes um and all it
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
says is judge
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
if you're going to infringe on a
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional right which you might be
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
able to do
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
tell us why you have to do it tell us
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
why there is no other less restrictive
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
way of doing it and please identify the
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
right that you're going to infringe on
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr markell any questions from
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
representative long you can unmute
 
00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.549 align:start position:0%
representative long you can unmute
yourself

00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
i don't deal with this every day so
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
um i get lost a lot of times when you
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
testify and keep adding cases i
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
but i pick up what i can uh so looking
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
at this bill so the court is responsible
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
for identifying
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
a right infringed correct correct so if
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
the court deems that the right
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
isn't infringing any state or federal
 
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.990 align:start position:0%
isn't infringing any state or federal
constitution

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
but a
 
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.390 align:start position:0%
but a
party

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
to the proceedings do how would that
 
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.669 align:start position:0%
to the proceedings do how would that
work

00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh well
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
when you say how would that work can you
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
try to i'm trying to answer your
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
question well i disagree with the judge
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't give me the opportunity
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
that my rights being in french that's up
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the judge to identify
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
my rights being the french well no you
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
have a right to make you you know you
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
with all due respect representative long
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
you absolutely
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
have the right to make that argument
 
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.510 align:start position:0%
have the right to make that argument
okay

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
where does it say that in here or where
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
does that say that in 458 or
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
um any
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
any other statute well it doesn't
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
because what you're doing is you're
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
making an argument to the court in other
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
words if a judge so in other words
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
here's the way this would typically play
 
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.070 align:start position:0%
here's the way this would typically play
out

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
one party submits a proposed order or
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
recites a set of circumstances that they
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
want the court to take a certain action
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
but it is always the government's burden
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
and this burden never shifts to an
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
individual okay under well-settled law
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
to justify actions that violate the
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
constitution this is always a government
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
burden it is never ever on a party
 
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.230 align:start position:0%
burden it is never ever on a party
okay

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's the that's the history of
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional law when the when the
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
government or court infringes on a right
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question directly
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh the court says i'm going to do what i
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
am going to for one of a better term i
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
am going to place content-based
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions okay on what you say to him
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
or to her or whatever i'm going to do
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
that you cannot talk about this you
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
cannot talk about that you cannot talk
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
about this and then
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
if it's in there and the and the party
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
is aware of it and hopefully that would
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
be in the statute because one of the key
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
portions of the statute is to give
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable notice uh to a little to a
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
party as to what the law is
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's well settled law so they come in
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
and they say but your honor i have
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and by the way
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
your honor i see that under this statute
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
if you're infringing on my
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh can you please tell me why you're
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
and why there is no less restrictive way
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
and then it would be up to the court to
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
justify the restriction to your question
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
yes represent follow-up
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh now with the newly added uh
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional right of privacy to the
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire's constitution
 
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.149 align:start position:0%
hampshire's constitution
um

00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:03.430 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
i would suspect that that could be tied
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
into anything you're
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're asking me to do
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
um whether or not you
 
00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:12.470 align:start position:0%
um whether or not you
um

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
you're compelling me to
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh release whatever income although
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
that's in another statute
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
but my mother pays for my oil heat and
 
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
but my mother pays for my oil heat and
that's

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
you're asking me for that
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
um do you see a potential um
 
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:31.570 align:start position:0%
do you see a potential um
 
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.470 align:start position:0%
do you see a potential um
[Music]

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know added burden
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
with respect to the right of privacy in
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
in these
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know in these infringements um
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
no because remember this first of all
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's no undue burden on a court this
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
is actually handled in a few sentences
 
00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:52.549 align:start position:0%
is actually handled in a few sentences
uh

00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
and that's not hard to do the other
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
thing is is that i don't see a right of
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
privacy here let me explain
 
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.070 align:start position:0%
privacy here let me explain
uh

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
that's governed differently okay uh and
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's governed by different statutes
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
for example uh
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
financial affidavits when filed with the
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
court become confidential as a matter of
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
law uh that is not an enumerated right
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
under the federal or state constitutions
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
uh this is actually fairly narrow okay
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
and it uh i hope i'm answering your
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
question representative long yeah
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
if i may uh look for the follow-up yeah
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
just just i mean maybe that was a bad
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
example i'm thinking of um
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
uh my
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
my right to have a gun in my room and to
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
me that's my private belonging and
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's my privacy that i want to keep
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
you have that yeah i'm sorry go ahead
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
and and i'm being compelled to uh
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
divulge that
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh that doesn't infringe on your
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
second amendment right i mean that's a
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
good question and i'm going to try to
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
answer it as best i can first of all let
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
me restate
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
this does not apply to domestic violence
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
petitions okay this does not apply to
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
domestic violence orders which by the
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
way cut across a wide swath of
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and they are
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
necessary to achieve a compelling
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
government interest so this doesn't
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply there okay
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to have a gun in your house
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's the second amendment that's your
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
right to keep and bear arms assuming you
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
are under no legal disability to do so
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh could a court for example
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
issue orders with respect to firearms
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
actually they probably could
 
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.430 align:start position:0%
actually they probably could
if

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
uh it was somehow necessary to protect
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
the best interests of a child for
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
example and this is by the way you're
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know you're asking a great question
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
here okay so let's look at the two
 
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.070 align:start position:0%
here okay so let's look at the two
rights

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.190 align:start position:0%
rights
um

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
first in terms of parenting in the best
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
interest of the child remember that we
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
always have that
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay because protecting a child from
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
danger is a compelling government
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
interest at the same time we have a
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
conflict we say that um representative
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
long says i own a gun the judge you
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
can't take away my gun rights no you're
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
not you can keep and bear but a time
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
place and manner restriction
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
would be considered valid and not
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
subject to an enumerated right for
 
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.190 align:start position:0%
subject to an enumerated right for
example

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
a court issues an order because guns are
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
an issue in this case for some reason
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a hypothetical
 
00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:35.990 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a hypothetical
judge

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
opposing party here leaves guns laying
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
around the house loaded
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
okay i'm seeking an order
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
to prevent
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh the other side here from leaving guns
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
laying around loaded because they have
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
parenting time and this is a
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
five-year-old child who may get into a
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
gun and hurt himself okay so if i'm the
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
judge okay i am going to
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
if it's a second and then representative
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
long says but your honor i have a second
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment right to keep and bear arms
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
and uh if i'm the judge
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna say you do have a second
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
amendment right to keep and bear arms
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
however i have a competing interest here
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
which is the best interest of the child
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay and so if i have to infringe
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
upon a my and by the way it would be a
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
mild infringement okay uh
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
on your right to keep and bear your
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
right to keep and bear does not extend
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
to leaving a loaded gun laying around
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
the house where a five-year-old can get
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
it okay so i am going to say that this
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
would be necessary to achieve a
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
compelling government interest if i'm
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
the judge i'm going to rule as follows
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say
 
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.950 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say
the

00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
party in question here asserts a second
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
amendment right to keep and bear arms
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
but i hear credible evidence that the
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
party who asserts the second amendment
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
right leaves a loaded gun around the
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
house where a child might be able to
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
access it
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay to preserve the best interests of
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
the child i make the following ruling
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say that i recognize that a
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
second amendment right exists
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
however this does not
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
me meaningfully infringe on the right to
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
keep and bear but it's necessary to
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
protect the best interest of the child
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
for him to keep
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
the loaded gun
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
out of reach or safely stored while
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
exercising parenting time or while the
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
child is in the house okay and there's
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
no less restrictive way for me to do it
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's my order as a court okay and

sense being uh brought to the brought to
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire legislature

i thank you very much
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't know i'm not sure how that
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily applies to this bill you
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
used an example
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony of someone being
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
barred from being able to practice their
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
religion because of a restraining order
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that that's did you
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
have examples of that ever happening in
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that seems rather extreme
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
well no what i uh i respectfully will
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%

and i'm going to say 458 16 1
 
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.190 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to say 458 16 1
b

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
b
 
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.069 align:start position:0%
b
c

00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
c
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
and d and when you look at b
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
in joining okay you have in joining any
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
party from entering the premises wherein
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
the other party resides upon a showing
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
of physical or emotional harm would
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
result in joining and then c
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
in joining any party from contacting the
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
other party or entering the other
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
party's place of employment or school
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
and then below that in joining any party
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
from harassing intimidating or
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
threatening the other party or other
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
parties relatives regardless of their
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
place of residences or other parties
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
household members in any way now
 
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.750 align:start position:0%
household members in any way now
why

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
if we respect the constitution if
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
there's no respect for the constitution
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
add this language and say in joining any
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
party from
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh entering the place of employment or
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
where the other party worships
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
because if you're dead
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
because what happens if somebody else
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
worships there as well
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
so in other words that's an implicit
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
recognition that that's freedom of
 
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.470 align:start position:0%
recognition that that's freedom of
religion

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
religion
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay now it creates a different dynamic
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
under other circumstances but if there
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
were no respect for that why would we
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
have it now we have practically an
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
identical track on rsa 461 810 which
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
also says 461 a 10 1
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
okay b and c which basically track the
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
same language uh entering the premises
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
enter contacting or entering the other
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
party's place of employment or school
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
once again no restriction on attending
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
church or synagogue or any other place
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay may i follow up madam chair
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
sure um actually want to go in a
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
different direction i i thank you for
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
on that interpretation um but i'd like
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
language of the bill okay and on on
 
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.230 align:start position:0%
language of the bill okay and on on
lines

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.870 align:start position:0%
lines
six

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
basically from the word identify on line
 
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.390 align:start position:0%
basically from the word identify on line
five

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
all the way to the word objective on
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
line seven
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay it appears that this
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
is uh this bill is
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
intent on creating a
 
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.550 align:start position:0%
intent on creating a
formula

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
and perhaps even a form
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
judges to fill out
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
that would have to
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know would create a you know a very
 
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.630 align:start position:0%
you know would create a you know a very
um

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
specific way of giving orders rather
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
than their thoughtful narratives
 
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.470 align:start position:0%
than their thoughtful narratives
um

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
and that seems like that would be that's
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
the sacrifice that is
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
being asked is that you're taking away
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion and judicial
 
00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:30.630 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion and judicial
um

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
creativity in the way that they're
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
applying the law
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
um and making them fill out a form
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh no actually not what this is is that
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
this simply goes right into the
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
narrative any judge sitting in this
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
state should have taken constitutional
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
law or should be familiar with it as a
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
matter of going to law school okay
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
number one number two is is that this
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
language actually tracks well settled
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional law which is called
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny strict scrutiny comes
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
and this is basically what this law is
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay this is this is where it comes from
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
i did not invent this uh in fact if you
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
look at the case i submitted called the
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
shock case okay you're gonna find strict
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
scrutiny in there okay because this is
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
well settled law i didn't create this
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh and so it's simply a test and it
 
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.710 align:start position:0%
okay uh and so it's simply a test and it
says

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
what's the necessary if i'm gonna
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
infringe on a constitutional right
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
the narrative is going to be something
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
like this and it goes right the the
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
order would be something like this and
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
goes right into the court's narrative
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.309 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
petitioner

00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
petitioner
 
00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:47.510 align:start position:0%
petitioner
seeks

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
seeks
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
a b c d e f g that they not be allowed
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
to fill in the blank not be allowed to

to fill in the blank not be allowed to
discuss

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.589 align:start position:0%
discuss
uh

00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh the child with third parties uh
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to whatever i
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
grant this
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
noting that the first amendment
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
does blank and has what's called prior
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
restraint okay however based on the
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
facts of this case which infringes which
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
may mildly infringe on a right however i
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
find as follows one the parties have a
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
history of blank
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
two the party
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
in question for whom this restriction
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
applies has a history which is
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
unchallenged of blank
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
the compelling interest here
 
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.670 align:start position:0%
the compelling interest here
is

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
that to protect or whatever okay to
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
protect the interests of a child or
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
protect whatever it is which is a
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
compelling government interest
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
and number four
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
having considered all the options
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
there is no less restrictive way of
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
achieving this compelling government
 
00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:00.950 align:start position:0%
achieving this compelling government
interest

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay and that is the supreme court test
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see it in the shock case
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
okay that i i emailed to the committee
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
because that's a very good recital of
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
first amendment now most of the
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
violations i think that
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of orders and constitutional
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
infringement that occurs
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
occurs in the first amendment context
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
either within a restraining order
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
context or outside of it okay and what
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
you have here
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
in your present statute is is that we
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
are telling the courts
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay on what i referenced before
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
we are telling the courts that guess
 
00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:39.109 align:start position:0%
we are telling the courts that guess
what

00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
the constitution really doesn't apply to
 
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.150 align:start position:0%
the constitution really doesn't apply to
you

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay that there is a family law
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
exception to the federal and state
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
constitutions when in fact there is no
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
such exception
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's my point in dealing with this so
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is curative
 
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.510 align:start position:0%
this is curative
um

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative out shoulder have i
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%

um i have the information i need thank
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%

good morning madam chair and members of

the committee my name is aaron justina
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%

00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
for more than 20 years the domestic
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
violence project has been representing
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
victims and survivors of domestic
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
violence sexual assault and stalking in
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
their protective order cases as well as
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
their high lethality divorce and
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
parenting cases i'm here today to
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to house bill 494
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
with respect i'm still very unclear as
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
to the issue this bill seeks to correct
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
um which constitutional rights exactly
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
have been infringed upon by utilizing
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
this type of restraining order
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
and right now we're talking about the
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
restraining under restraining orders
 
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.710 align:start position:0%
restraining under restraining orders
under

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.870 align:start position:0%
under
rsa

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
458-16 so under the divorce statute
 
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.710 align:start position:0%
458-16 so under the divorce statute
um

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
attorney markel provided some very
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
nuanced examples where half of the
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
action by the court is permissible in
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
his opinion but the other half is not if
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
this bill were to become law i'm not
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
sure how judges would even apply it this
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
is exactly a solution looking for a
 
00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:35.670 align:start position:0%
is exactly a solution looking for a
problem

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill is far too
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
technical for the average person
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
accessing the family court to understand
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
as practitioners even we reviewed this
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill and had difficulty pinpointing the
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
objective and the process for which that
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
objective would be achieved
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
so these restraining orders the ones
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about today we're
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
talking about restraining orders under
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
the marital statute and under the
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
statute so these types of restraining
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
orders are less restrictive
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
than other civil protective orders and i
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
think that may be causing some of the
 
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.790 align:start position:0%
think that may be causing some of the
confusion

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
so orders
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
these orders can be used in cases where
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps the party doesn't qualify for a
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
protective order under rsa 173b which is
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence statue or simply
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't want the protections offered
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
under that statute but it is clear
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
something needs to be in place to act as
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
a buffer between the parties in a
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
particularly high conflict case or even
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
in a case involving domestic violence
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
this type of restraining order is often
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
used to settle cases
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
again one party may be willing to forego
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence protective order in
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
exchange for a marital or parenting
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
restraining order if it means settling
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
so again i
 
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
so again i
understand

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
that the intent was to
 
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.069 align:start position:0%
that the intent was to
um

00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
create clarification around these types
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
of restraining orders um but based on
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony today based on our reading
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the proposed language of the proposed
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill i think it's going to create
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
further confusion and again this bill is
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
seeking a solution to a problem that
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
does not currently exist so therefore we
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully requested this committee
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%

abused because within that 10-day period
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
guns are taken away uh depending on the
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
issue and the court order from the judge
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
and um you know you're removed and
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i've said on many cases here i'm one
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
of the original representatives uh on
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
the redress caucus
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
and we've heard cases of uh over
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
religious cases where one parent wanted
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
the kid to go
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
back to the religious school and the
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
other parent that had the custody didn't
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
want it uh there are many cases out
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
there that rights are being abused now
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
how do i know this here because i'm a
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
victim of one myself
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay on a restraining order didn't know
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
anything until the police showed up and
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
said i have to leave a house
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
i was fortunate to fight it i got it
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
dismissed and got custody of my
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
um daughter um in a divorce case
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
children are used as political pawns and
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
all it takes is for a parent to go
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
and say that they fear for their life
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
and a restraining order is issued
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
this is a no-brainer
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
this legislation the system needs to be
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
fixed and i want to thank
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
the chairman for bringing this bill
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
forward because
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
it's going to fix something that is
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
broken in the family court we all know
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
that and there is a bunch of us
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
legislators that sat in family courts
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
and watched and heard and seen what goes
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
on on these restraining orders
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
um so i thank you uh for bringing this
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
forward and i was honored to co-sponsor
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative baldassaro
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative altschiller has a
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
question for you will you take it
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
i sure would
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you you cannot mute yourself
 
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.109 align:start position:0%
thank you you cannot mute yourself
representative

00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative baldassaro for
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
entertaining a question
 
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.549 align:start position:0%
entertaining a question
um

00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:18.069 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
i'm curious because i think that
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
have you
 
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.230 align:start position:0%
have you
possibly

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
mixed up the two different kinds of
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
restraining orders because um
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
what what is what we've been talking
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
about is is not
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
a restraining order that would remove
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
someone from a house
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
um nor take away their firearms we're
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about parenting plans
 
00:50:43.359 --> 00:50:44.549 align:start position:0%
we're talking about parenting plans
um

00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:44.559 --> 00:50:45.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
is it possible that maybe this is this
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
this is not that bill
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
not at all because when you take away a
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
parenting plan you're actually taking
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
away other rights because you've moved
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
out of the house
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh and i know it firsthand because i was
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
involved with the parenting plan
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh but it took me 10 days of being out
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
of a house and everything else and
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
losing a lot of my rights
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
until i got back into court and got it
 
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:18.790 align:start position:0%
until i got back into court and got it
dismissed

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
mayor thank you
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
this bill would only
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to compel judges
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
why they are doing what they are doing
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
in a detailed in a detailed way
 
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.190 align:start position:0%
in a detailed in a detailed way
and

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so i don't understand
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
how i don't understand how you're
 
00:51:49.839 --> 00:51:51.349 align:start position:0%
how i don't understand how you're
conflating

00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
conflating
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
taking away um
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
firearms from someone who is a danger to
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
themselves or their family and
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
deemed to have to have that
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
that process taken
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
with this bill that
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
is asking the government to explain that
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
in great detail so
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
there's no police involvement unless
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
someone is actually committing a crime
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
is there a question in there
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
the question is do you understand that
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is no invol police involvement
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
unless there is a crime
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's any any type of restraining
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
order the police are involved because
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
they go to your house and deliver it
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
there was no crime in my case it's just
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
somebody with fear for life that goes to
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
the court and says that i have a problem
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
then a parental plan is taken put in
 
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.670 align:start position:0%
then a parental plan is taken put in
place

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
and you're moved out of the house um
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand where you're going
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
with that there because it's a it's
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
happening all the time
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know with the parental plans to a um
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative baldassaro
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
have a good day
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you you as well
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
the next person we have to testify is mr
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
richard head
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is richard head
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
i'm the government affairs coordinator
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
um i think there is a a fundamental
 
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.870 align:start position:0%
um i think there is a a fundamental
misunderstanding

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
what the statute allows
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
because the statute does not create an
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
exception to the constitution
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative body cannot
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
create a statutory exception to
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing in the current
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
statute that
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
expands a judge's rights relative to the
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of the people in
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
front of that judge
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
so you know i think there's a
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental premise that is that is not
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
is still bound by the constitution and
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
if a statute is unconstitutional this uh
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
the court would have to find that the
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
statute is unconstitutional then simply
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
cannot apply it
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
um or would have to extract out the
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional provisions of the of
 
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.829 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional provisions of the of
the

00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
statute the other aspect of the bill
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
that i think is um
 
00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:29.910 align:start position:0%
that i think is um
is

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
is inaccurate is that it applies
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
it talks as to strict scrutiny which is
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh as attorney markell stated
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
ways in which you review constitutional
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
provisions and for some constitutional
 
00:54:46.559 --> 00:54:47.750 align:start position:0%
provisions and for some constitutional
provisions

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny is the appropriate
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
level of review but there are in fact
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
three levels of scrutiny relative to
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional provisions and it depends
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
entirely upon the circumstances in the
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the constitutional provision involved
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh and the bill as written does not
 
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.470 align:start position:0%
uh and the bill as written does not
limit

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
the review to or the issue to the first
 
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:09.589 align:start position:0%
the review to or the issue to the first
amendment

00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
but talks about
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
all constitutional provisions state and
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
federal and there are in fact three
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
tiers of review strict scrutiny
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
intermediate scrutiny and rational basis
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
scrutiny depending on the constitutional
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
provision involved
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
so this would
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
this would actually create a standard
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
for all constitutional provisions that
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
would apply the strict scrutiny uh
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
standard which is which is not
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional law
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
and then my final point is that this
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
does not change anything
 
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
the courts are still bound by the
 
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.309 align:start position:0%
the courts are still bound by the
constitution

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the court's decisions are subject to
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
review as would occur under this under
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh and if the supreme court makes a
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
determination that a ruling was
 
00:55:57.799 --> 00:55:59.430 align:start position:0%
determination that a ruling was
unconstitutional

00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
in in in in similar to the the decision
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
that attorney markell provided you the
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
shack massachusetts decision it applies
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
the same way in new hampshire the
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
evaluates the decision
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
determines whether or not a
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision has been
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
violated and if so whether or not under
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
the one of the three appropriate tiers
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
of scrutiny whether there was a basis
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
for which
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
that could occur so there's nothing in
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
current law in the legislature is not
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
authorized through current law
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
judges to violate the constitution
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
and in fact this bill as written
 
00:56:41.119 --> 00:56:42.309 align:start position:0%
and in fact this bill as written
would

00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
incorrectly apply level of scrutiny
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
relative to various constitutional
 
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.829 align:start position:0%
relative to various constitutional
provisions

00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh given the breadth of of the
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill um
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
so ai test try for information but i i
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
think there are some
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
at the foundation of the of the proposal
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
some misunderstandings uh and i would be
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr head
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much mr
 
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.910 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much mr

00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
um and we will close this hearing
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
we had uh one in support
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%

we will go on to
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%

right
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%

that haven't signed in so yes we did
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%

next hearing
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 495
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
i am the sponsor so i will read the bill
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
and we will move on from there thank
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
you this bill provides that the court
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
shall not
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
issue an order in a parenting case that
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
infringes upon a party's constitutional
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
rights unless the court determines there
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
is no less restrictive means to achieve
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
a compelling government interest
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
and with that i will be happy to turn
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
the testimony over to
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
mr markel
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes we can now thank you mr martin go
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
ahead to the previous testimony i'm well
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
aware of the three levels of
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional review there is what's
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
called rational basis there is what's
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
called intermediate scrutiny and there's
 
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
what's called strict scrutiny what we're
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
talking about here is this strict
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and the reason why is because
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
if it infringes on a right now bear in
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
mind okay a couple of things number one
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
is is that rational basis says that all
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
it has to do
 
00:59:47.359 --> 00:59:48.309 align:start position:0%
it has to do
is

00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
is basically for economic and social
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
legislation okay so in other words
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
is it constitutional to regulate certain
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
kinds of businesses we heard from the
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
judiciary so let's discuss what these
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
levels of review are and try to keep it
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
real and try to keep it meaningful okay
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
number one rational basis review under
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
the constitution is things like economic
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
and social legislation okay economic and
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
social legislation is can they issue for
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
example a business require you to have a
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
business license to give
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
to open a business the answer is yes can
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
they require barbers to have licenses
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
and pass levels of competency to get
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
that the answer is yes can government
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
regulate certain businesses uh at to
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
certain extents and that gets rational
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
basis review in other words is it
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
connected to a rational government
 
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.470 align:start position:0%
connected to a rational government
objective

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
objective
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
intermediate level of scrutiny okay are
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
things like uh time place and manner
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions okay so in other words when
 
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.910 align:start position:0%
restrictions okay so in other words when
you

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.789 align:start position:0%
you
say

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
you have visitation in a parenting class
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
in a parenting program okay you have
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
this level of visitation it's on
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
weekends it's this and that okay for
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
example or better yet um in terms of
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
speech and parades you have to get a
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
permit okay uh to manifest your right of
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
free speech you can your parade permit
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
is good for
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
x days or x hours between this and this
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
and this okay those are time place and
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
manner restrictions and they get a
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
lesser uh more deferential standard of
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
review what we're talking about here are
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
things like content based restrictions
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
that's prior okay that constitutes prior
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
restraint when a court says so in other
 
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.390 align:start position:0%
restraint when a court says so in other
words

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
when and judges should be familiar with
 
01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.150 align:start position:0%
when and judges should be familiar with
this

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
so when you hear so when somebody says
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
you can't tell me that i can't talk on
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
this time place or manner restriction
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
the court simply says okay this is a
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
time place and manner restriction and
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's not subject to this kind of review
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh what we're talking about is
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
things like content-based regulation and
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
so i understand what i heard before but
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
those are basically the three levels of
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
review that we're talking about uh
 
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
number one this does not constitute a
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
burden on on the court system at all uh
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
judges should understand it um
 
01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.470 align:start position:0%
judges should understand it um
if

01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying here is is that you have
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
and what i'll restate in 461 a10 is is
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
that you have such conditions and
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
limitations as a court may deem just
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
okay now
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
the practical aspects are
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
that um courts will say yes i can and by
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
the way in terms of it being a problem a
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a problem uh
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps i should redax heavily some
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
orders so that you should see them
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know eliminating courts eliminating
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
judge names and eliminating parties
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
because i have the orders so this is a
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
problem and it's not just a solution
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem
 
01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.030 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem
uh

01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
you know i would want to check further
 
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
to see if that's permissible but these
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
are the kinds of things that are out
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
there um
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is is that the
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
notion that you can be able to go to the
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
supreme court and get things adjusted
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay as a practical matter this provides
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
a standard of review
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay so in other words um judge this is
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
what happened in the case were my
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights violated so in
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
other words was there an error of law
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
involved which is a different standard
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
of review from the unsustainable
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
exercise of discretion to the prejudice
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
of of a um
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
of a uh
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
of a litigant uh
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's basically where we're at um this
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
is i think a mild i think this is a mild
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
remedy it doesn't tell courts that they
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
can't do things all they simply have to
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
do is justify it if a court disagrees
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
and said this does not apply this simply
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
calls upon the court to exercise the
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
knowledge that it should that it ought
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
um as far as it once again we heard from
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legal assistance we
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
respect their positions but this is not
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence issue it simply
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
isn't domestic violence travels under
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
its own authority with its own levels of
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
protections um this is simply an uh
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
a protection of constitutional this is
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
simply a vehicle by which courts and
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
parties get notice of constitutional
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
rights and are able to aggravate and be
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%

and madam chair with your permission um

house bill 494 and 495 are
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
nearly ident they are identical they're
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
just placed in two different statutes so
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
my testimony would be the same for 494
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
as well as 4.95 so in the interest of
 
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.750 align:start position:0%
as well as 4.95 so in the interest of
time

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
i will not reiterate that testimony if
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's all right with you madam chair
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
but i i do just have two follow-up
 
01:05:39.839 --> 01:05:41.190 align:start position:0%
but i i do just have two follow-up
points

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
points
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%

hopefully everyone will remember 494. so
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
i will just reiterate that testimony um
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
but i do want to clarify um and respond
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
to attorney markell's
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
position that this is not a domestic
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
violence issue it is a domestic violence
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
issue um we heard from a representative
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
who um said that these types of
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
restraining orders
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
um remove people from the home and guns
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
are removed and that is simply not the
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
case um respectfully that is not the
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
case um i believe what he is referring
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
to is um
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
protections that are reported a victim
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
under rsa
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
173b or under the stalking statute which
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
is rsa 633
 
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.470 align:start position:0%
is rsa 633
3a

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
3a
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
so in those situations where a domestic
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
violence victim goes to court and files
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
a petition
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the court issues a temporary order
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
in that situation
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
then yes
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
um if guns were involved if there are
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
guns in the home or other weapons in the
 
01:06:54.319 --> 01:06:55.270 align:start position:0%
guns in the home or other weapons in the
home

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
in that situation yes a police officer
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
is going to show up at the house is
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
going to remove the person from the home
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
and is going to remove those weapons
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely what happens under
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
those two statutes that is not what is
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
happening in this situation
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
guns are not removed
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
you're not removed from your home
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
unless as representative alt shiller
 
01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:23.349 align:start position:0%
unless as representative alt shiller
commented

01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
commented
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
you are not getting arrested for
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
violating this restraining order unless
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
you are committing a crime which you
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
would be arrested for anyway
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
um so if somebody assaults someone
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not there's
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
this type of restraining order in place
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
or another type you're getting arrested
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
because you committed a crime um this is
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
a civil restraining order um
 
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.670 align:start position:0%
a civil restraining order um
again

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
police involvement
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
is not happening unless you are in fact
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
committing a crime
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
if you violate
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
a um
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
restraining under restraining order
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
under 458 16 or under 461 a
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a contempt motion in
 
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.270 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a contempt motion in
court

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to address that point but
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
also to attorney mark hill's point that
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a domestic violence issue
 
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.390 align:start position:0%
it's not a domestic violence issue
um

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
these restraining orders as i mentioned
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
in my earlier testimony are often used
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
in settling domestic violence cases or i
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
should say domestic violence involve
 
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
divorce or parenting cases
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned um you may have a
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
victim who does not wish to seek um an
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
order under 173b
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons why a victim may
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
choose not to do that
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps she doesn't want to
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
have another court involved case
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps does not want to share the very
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
very intimate details of a sexual
 
01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:55.349 align:start position:0%
very intimate details of a sexual
assault

01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
assault
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps does not want to access that
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
protection because it may escalate the
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
abuse by her abuser
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
it could increase her lethality risk
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
so an alternative for a domestic
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
violence victim is to get one of these
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
restraining orders in a divorce and
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
parenting case one of these restraining
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
orders which yes
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps less well is less restrictive
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
will be the deterrent
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
for that abuser to leave the victim
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
alone and to cease the abuse
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
um so i respectfully disagree that these
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
are not domestic violence related um
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
restraining orders they they are we use
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
them in cases
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
to resolve cases to settle cases for our
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
clients that don't want to go through
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
the 173b process but wants something in
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
place to make the abuse stop
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
um and and these do that to some extent
 
01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.390 align:start position:0%
um and and these do that to some extent
um

01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons and for the
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that i offered under house
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
bill 494
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
i respectfully request that this
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
committee return a vote of inexpedient
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i'm happy to
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you miss jacina
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none oh i'm sorry representative
 
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.110 align:start position:0%
seeing none oh i'm sorry representative
lewicki

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
lewicki
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you uh
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
mr zena um
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
i am trying to understand why
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
how your testimony applies to this bill
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's a domestic violence order
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
or any other order what reason could
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
there possibly be for not putting in a
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure how these um
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
how the language of this bill is
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
infringing on somebody's constitutional
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
rights and i think it's the language of
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
this bill that is confusing as i stated
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
in my earlier testimony just the plain
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
language of this bill is not accessible
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the general public i think it's going
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
difficult to apply
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
you heard mr head testify um for the
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
reasons that and i will um agree with
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
his testimony in response to that
 
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.830 align:start position:0%
his testimony in response to that
question

01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up um thank you madam chair
 
01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
follow-up um thank you madam chair
um

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
a college dropout and i have no
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
difficulty reading this language
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
why would you assert that somebody
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
isn't able to understand it it looks
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
like plain english to me
 
01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:39.189 align:start position:0%
like plain english to me
um

01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully i will answer your question
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
um that most people have a
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
very um
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
low grade reading level um i think like
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
the average is somewhere around middle
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
school or high school and so you're
 
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.149 align:start position:0%
school or high school and so you're
having

01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
general public accessing and people who
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't speak any english at all
 
01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.830 align:start position:0%
don't speak any english at all
low-income

01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
low-income
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
people seeking
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
services or
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
justice through our family court system
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
and trying to review our laws these are
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
not easy to read they're not accessible
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the language of this bill is not
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
accessible so um
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that the reading to you is
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
very plain
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cena anyone else have any
 
01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:41.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cena anyone else have any
questions

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions we'll move
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
on to the next person who wishes to
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
testify mr richard had
 
01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.189 align:start position:0%
testify mr richard had
um

01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh madam chair uh thank you
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
richard head i'm the government affairs
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch um
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you for giving me the
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify again as was
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
stated this is very similar to the last
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
bill but i'll repeat myself a little bit
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i apologize
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
the bill would provide that
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
the court has to identify
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
any rights
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
being infringed under any enumerated
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
federal or state constitutional
 
01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.750 align:start position:0%
federal or state constitutional
provision

01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
and as i said
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
before there are three levels of
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
scrutiny depending on
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
which constitutional enumerated
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision is is being is
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
at issue
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
it could be strict scrutiny which is
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
specifically identified in the bill
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
there's intermediate scrutiny and
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's rational basis
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
this would provide
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
that all
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
orders issued under 173 b
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
if there is a potential infringement on
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
a constitutional right would have to
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh be subject to stroke scrutiny which
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
is which is simply not the standard for
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
all provisions
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
secondly there is it does not accomplish
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
anything that is not already
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
current in existing law as i said with
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
regard to the other bill um the statute
 
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.470 align:start position:0%
regard to the other bill um the statute
that's

01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
targeted here rsa 173 b
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
does not create any exceptions to the
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
constitution the legislature is simply
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
not authorized to create exceptions to
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
the constitution and is not authorized
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
to give judges authority to violate
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional provisions the judges are
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
always subject to the constitution
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
and so any time
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
a court whether
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that a particular area
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
of law is not
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh well described
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
so so the court needs the supreme court
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
needs to issue
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
a ruling for the first time relative to
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
the constitutional authority to issue a
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
type of order
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
or that the court has already the
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court has already described
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
when certain limitations
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
are constitutionally authorized
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
that already exists in in current law
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
and and as the last sentence of the bill
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
says any party aggrieved by an order not
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
meeting the standard may petition the
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
court to have the order modified or
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
vacated anytime
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
if for whatever reason a constitutional
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
right is infringed upon by a court's
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
order the party always has the right to
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
seek reconsideration of that order or to
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
appeal to the supreme court in the
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
supreme court on a constitutional issue
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh does not
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
look at it as an unsustainable exercise
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
of discretion standard
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
but looks at all constitutional issues
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
new and and bases it on its own review
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
not upon the trial court's review
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
so there is no difference in the sense
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
of how the supreme court looks at
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues with or without
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
regard to this bill
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
um so as with regard to the other
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh the last bill that we heard you know
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
the the foundation for the the reason
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
behind this bill
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
simply does not exist
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be happy to take any
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki do you have a
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair and
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr head
 
01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.270 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr head
so

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
i believe what i hear you telling me and
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
please tell me if it's not is that uh
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
while someone appeals their rights to
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
the supreme court those rights will be
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
held in abeyance
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
not always um so if an order can be
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
stayed pending review
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
either by the trial court's order or by
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
the supreme court's order so not
 
01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:43.590 align:start position:0%
the supreme court's order so not
necessarily

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%

01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
i will thank mr head for his testimony
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%

foster care
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
this bill was filed in response to the
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
united states inspector general's
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
september 2018 report treatment planning
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
and medication monitoring were lacking
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
for children in foster care receiving
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medication
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
which i've also emailed to the committee
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
for the permanent record
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
note especially page 23 which summarizes
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
specifics relevant to new hampshire and
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
which i also emailed to you separately
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
for convenience
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
what the office of the inspector general
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
did is to review medicaid claims data
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
and clinical records in the five states
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
which reported the highest percentage of
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
children in foster care receiving
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had the third highest
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
it did this because the administration
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
for children and families is responsible
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
for awarding federal funding to state's
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
child welfare programs and for
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
overseeing those programs
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
and they reminded us on page three of
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
their report that if acf finds that a
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
state is not in substantial conformity
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
with its state plan
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
it has the authority to withhold a
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
certain amount of federal funding
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
what the inspector general found is that
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
23.4 percent of new hampshire children
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
in foster care receiving psychotropic
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
medications had no treatment plan
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
37.9 percent had a treatment plan but no
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
diagnosis on their treatment plan
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
as a doctor i am most troubled that the
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
total of these numbers is 61.3 percent
 
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.390 align:start position:0%
total of these numbers is 61.3 percent
meaning

01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
that the majority of the kids in new
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire foster care receiving
 
01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications had no
 
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.189 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications had no
diagnosis

01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
and 21.8 percent of these children did
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
not receive medication monitoring by a
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
prescribing professional
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 120 is actually a pretty
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
simple bill
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
last year with house bill 1278 which was
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
similar which you guys sent to interim
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
study there was an objection to the
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
department using rulemaking to limit the
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
use of psychotropic drugs
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
in house bill 120 we defined medication
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
restraint as the use of psychotropic
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
drugs without a clinical diagnosis and
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
apply the existing law in rsa 126u
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
to such use
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
medication restraint is specifically
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
referenced in rsa 126u
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
colon 1 roman 4.
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
so long as medical practitioners are
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
treating disease
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
or in other words list the diagnosis
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
this will never apply to legitimate
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
medical treatment
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
this is similar to how we limited the
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
use of psychotropic medications as a
 
01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.070 align:start position:0%
use of psychotropic medications as a
restraint

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
restraint
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
in hospitals and nursing homes a
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
generation ago
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
california passed a similar bill
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
tightening oversight over the use of
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications in foster care
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
in 2015 and it has resulted in a 45
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
percent reduction in antipsychotic
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
prescriptions to foster care kids
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
and a 73 percent reduction in
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for multiple psychotropic
 
01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.669 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for multiple psychotropic
drugs

01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
the inspector general on page 31 of his
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
report said that new hampshire spent one
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
million seven hundred and forty one
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred and eighty one
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
dollars for psychotropic medications for
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
foster kids in 2016.
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
while this bill lacks a fiscal note i
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
would contend that a similar 45 percent
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
reduction in new hampshire would result
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
in a 783 thousand
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh 711 dollar savings to the new
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire budget
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
i also sent you amendment 0517h
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
which addresses specific concerns
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
brought forward by the new hampshire
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
psychiatric society i'm sure they will
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
speak to their uh
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
word language changes and in my opinion
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
it improves the bill without undermining
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
my intent
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you and i will be glad to
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%

thank you representative marsh do i see

the state child advocate i appreciate
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak in support of
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 120 relative to the
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
administration of psychotropic
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
medications to children in foster care
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
we're very grateful to representative
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
marsh for raising this bill it's a very
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
we support it and we did work with new
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire psychiatric society
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
to craft a few suggested amendments to
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
but as he said it doesn't change it it
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
just um and strengthens it and
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
protecting children
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
he has already referenced the inspector
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
general's report which i think is very
 
01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.590 align:start position:0%
general's report which i think is very
important

01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
to note and to guide this conversation
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
children in dcyf custody are
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
predominantly children who are victims
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
of abuse neglect or other family
 
01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.070 align:start position:0%
of abuse neglect or other family
dysfunction

01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
dysfunction
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
that causes a high level of adverse
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
and aces are associated with mental
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
illness communication disorders um that
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
often manifest as problem behaviors and
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
generally removal from their homes is a
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
response to the need for safety
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
but treatment that's prompted by the
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
persistent symptoms of this mental
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
illness or problem behaviors um tends to
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
be um often more medication focused than
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
and then otherwise and so it's really
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
important to be thinking about how we
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
protect kids when they're receiving
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
these medications anecdotally
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate has
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
reviewed a number of children's cases in
 
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.350 align:start position:0%
reviewed a number of children's cases in
which

01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
problematic changes in the child's
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
behavior appear primarily addressed by
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
medication changes and in some of those
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
cases we've seen it later discovered
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
that there were manifested behaviors
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
that were caused by other underlying
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
physical conditions so we're really very
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about not just monitoring
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
the use of psychotropic medication but
 
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
also monitoring children's health in
 
01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.229 align:start position:0%
also monitoring children's health in
general

01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
so some of the
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the recommended changes that that
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
we've brought forward
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
would first of all amend the definition
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
of medication restraint
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
um to make put the proposal in hb 120
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
consistent with the definition of
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
medication restraint already in rsa
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
chapter 126u
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
and for that we would say change the
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
language to medication restraint is
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
defined as the involuntary
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
administration of any medication
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
including psychotropic medication
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
without a clinical diagnosis for the
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
purpose of controlling behavior unless
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
it is to ensure the immediate physical
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
safety of persons when there's
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
substantial or imminent risk of serious
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
bodily harm to children
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
we also suggest amending the title of
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 169b section 23 on page 1
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%

01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
those are language changes but they what
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
they do is they change
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
to encompass both physical and mental
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
health treatment as i referenced you
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
before sometimes behavior change isn't a
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
psychological problem it's an underlying
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
physical issue
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that we're
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensively assessing children um
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
and also addressing the stigma that's
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
associated with mental health treatment
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
caused by separating physical and mental
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
health out it's all health for children
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
we further recommend that prior to
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
prescribing psychotropic medications the
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
prescribing provider should first ensure
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
two assessments are or have been
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
recently conducted one is a
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
comprehensive medical
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
assessment to rule out any physical
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
organic condition underlying the
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
symptoms that the medication is intended
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
to treat and that will ensure the
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
holistic approach um effective
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
diagnostics and treatment and also
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
minimize the exposure to unnecessary
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
and the next thing we recommend in terms
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
of assessment is a comprehensive
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
psychosocial assessment and a plan and
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
implemented evidence-based treatments
 
01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.470 align:start position:0%
implemented evidence-based treatments
accordingly

01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
especially in the cases of young
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
children the professional consensus is
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
to address psychosocial issues prior to
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
or at least in concert with prescribing
 
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.750 align:start position:0%
or at least in concert with prescribing
medications

01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
medications
 
01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.270 align:start position:0%
medications
additionally

01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
because of the unfortunate trends in
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
inconsistency of placement of children
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
children's health care is not always
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
consistently followed by any one
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
provider or parent like proxy
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in this state
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
we feel that when a child sees a
 
01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:51.669 align:start position:0%
we feel that when a child sees a
provider

01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
who prescribes psychotropic medications
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
the consultation should include the
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
child's guardian and a dcyf nurse to
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're aware and informed
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
of the reason for the medication the
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
therapeutic intention of the medication
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
and any potential side effects that
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
should be monitored we also suggest that
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
the bill include the expectation that
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
any child in foster care whose
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
prescribed psychotropic medications will
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
be referred to a dcyf district office
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
nurse for their monitoring of care and
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
provision of informational support and
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
guidance to the field staff and to the
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
caregivers of the child this provides
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
for some consistent oversight if
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
children are moving around and seeing
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
different providers
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
um to incorporate those suggestions we
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
recommend adding the following language
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
and i have i have submitted written
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
testimony to you um that has the pages
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
and lines in them so i'll leave that out
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
but that's just um in the interest of
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
time it's there where we would change
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
that language we also
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
recommend um an amendment in terms of
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
the duties of the impart of the
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
department to ensure that dcy of
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
district office nurses provide
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
medication monitoring for children in
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
foster care that's more language there
 
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's no distinction in this bill
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
about who prescribes psychotropic
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
medication to children in foster care
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
and that's actually okay because the
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility is necessary as you probably
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
all know
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
there's a chronic shortage of child
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists in new hampshire
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
but if we're codifying the use of
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications it would be
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
neglectful not to be sure that anyone
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
prescribing medications has access to
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
expertise and guidance to make the best
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
decisions for children
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's an excellent model several
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
excellent models of support for primary
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
care pediatricians
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
who are willing to prescribe
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications with adequate
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
support and guidance
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
i direct your attention to the
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts child psychiatry access
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
project which is one of those model that
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
provides a remote consultation and
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
educational supports on best practices
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
to primary care pediatricians
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
dcyf currently contracts with dartmouth
 
01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
dcyf currently contracts with dartmouth
hitchcock

01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
hitchcock
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
for services of a psychiatrist at the
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
sununu youth services center
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
and because the uh the census has been
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
so low there he's actually had time to
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
do some consultations on medication
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
reviews of some of children across the
 
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.189 align:start position:0%
reviews of some of children across the
state

01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
so his contract's not adequate to
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
provide the level of support that we're
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
thinking of to pediatric providers but
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
it certainly is a start maybe something
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
that could evolve into a program like
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts program that i i
 
01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.310 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts program that i i
recommend

01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
so we suggest that being added in
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
and finally centralized oversight of
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
children's care is essential
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
to identify trends across child
 
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.990 align:start position:0%
to identify trends across child
experience

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
the bill calls for reporting to the
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
joint legislative oversight committee on
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
and we have found that reports that go
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
to legislative committees are sometimes
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
not always consistently monitored just
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
because of you know the unfortunateness
 
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
of a two-year term in the legislation in
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
so we recommend that in addition to that
 
01:33:05.199 --> 01:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
so we recommend that in addition to that
report

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
pathway that it also
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
um be sent to the office of the child
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
advocate um so that we can do some
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
consistent monitoring um of the reports
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
and report back to the committees as
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
well um we've started doing that
 
01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
well um we've started doing that
with

01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
looking at restraints and seclusion
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's reported to committees we're
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
finding that it's very helpful to have
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
someone who's actually monitoring and
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
analyzing data that's coming in
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
i have also provided for your
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
information at the bottom of my written
 
01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.790 align:start position:0%
information at the bottom of my written
testimony

01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
some details about the side effects of
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications just so that
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
you have some awareness of that
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
these drugs can really change lives they
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
can be very helpful but they are also
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know dangerous in in children's
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
brains when they're not used um
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately so it's important to
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
really understand the impact of them um
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll stop there and thank you for
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony i welcome your
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair and thank you ms
o'neill

01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
o'neill
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
do you know whether dcyf has the
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
resources to implement this which would
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
be nurses and so forth
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question and i'm
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
happy to answer that in the last
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
biennium budget there there was funding
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
for nursing positions
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
they're not all filled yet but they are
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the process of hiring them and we're
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
really pleased for that dcyf had nurses
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the past um and they were lost in the
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
last 10 years but they're back and
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's a really good role for them when
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
children have special medical needs that
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
um that they're there to not just
 
01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
monitor the individual child but also to
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
give guidance to caseworkers who often
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
are involved in decision making and
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
guidance to the caregivers whether
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're foster parents or um or for
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
biological parents who are in the
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
process of reunifying who need to really
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
understand medications that their
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
children are receiving
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you next uh question is uh
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
representative blanchard
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um and thank
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
you maura
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
for uh attending our committee hearing
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
today um you alluded to a low number of
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
students at the sysc center um and just
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
for curiosity's sake how many students
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative belanger i believe today
 
01:35:37.110 --> 01:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
the census is around 12.
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's been in the last few months eight
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
to ten
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
i think the average for the year dcyf is
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
reporting is about 24 but we've seen
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
consistently you know under around
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
hovering around 10 and i would say the
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
last eight months or so
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you no fault
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you next we have representative
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
long you have a question
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you miss
 
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
o'neill for your testimony a couple
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions on the uh
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
01:36:08.159 --> 01:36:09.110 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
uh

01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
it asks for um it asks for consultation
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
with the child's caregiver is does that
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
does that include the foster care family
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
representative long yes that's what um
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
what our intent was when we suggested
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry i don't have a copy of the
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
amendment so i don't know the exact
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
language but um but the person who's
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
taking care of the child and that may be
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
a foster parent or it may be you know
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
upon return to a biological parent
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
just so that we're that whoever is with
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
the child knows what medications the
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
child is on knows what the side effects
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
are to watch for it knows what the um
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
what the intended therapeutic effect are
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that we know you know whether it's
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
safe and also effective
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
like essentially how a parent would
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
monitor you know their own child's care
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh can i follow up madam chair
 
01:37:04.159 --> 01:37:05.830 align:start position:0%
uh can i follow up madam chair
follow

01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
so the the language says uh shall
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
include consultation with child
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
caregiver or lady legal guardian
 
01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.750 align:start position:0%
caregiver or lady legal guardian
um

01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
and the dcyf district nurse so i
 
01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.149 align:start position:0%
and the dcyf district nurse so i
so

01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that the child caregiver
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
is the foster parent i i
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm looking to include the foster parent
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so i don't want the foster parent
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
to be excluded if there's a legal
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
guardian or the nurse
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
suffices but what you're saying is that
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
that language would include the foster
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
parent correct
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative long i i think that's the
 
01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
representative long i i think that's the
intention

01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
intention
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
um i think what i
 
01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:49.830 align:start position:0%
um i think what i
i

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
i we we certainly wanted to include the
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
foster so the caregivers anyone who's
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
taking care of the of the child which
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
could be phosphate maybe that's a need
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
for a definition there um but also
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
listening to you read it out i i do get
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
worried about logistics and wonder if we
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't um have the language say and
 
01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.270 align:start position:0%
shouldn't um have the language say and
or

01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
um or when it possible because that
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
because we're talking now about three
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
people the district nurse the caregiver
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and the potentially the guardian and
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
if and we don't want to delay care
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
because we can't get all three people
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
into a room but they but a consultation
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
with them could also just be a phone
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
call and a conversation and follow up
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay and another uh one more follow-up
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
if i may another question
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh you you mentioned dcyf oversight
 
01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.590 align:start position:0%
okay uh you you mentioned dcyf oversight
when

01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing the bill
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
i don't see specific dcyf oversight i
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
see department of health and human
 
01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:45.270 align:start position:0%
see department of health and human
service

01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
monitoring but it's not specific to
 
01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.310 align:start position:0%
monitoring but it's not specific to
dcyf

01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
we assume that
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
health and human services would
 
01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.870 align:start position:0%
health and human services would
be

01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
the division of dcyf
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question i um i'm i'm
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
i guess i would assume that and and i'm
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't see that language
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
but if the if the dcyf nurse is there
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
and monitoring then that is dcyf
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
oversight i would assume
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i i guess i would add in some cases
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
um there may be uh
 
01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.629 align:start position:0%
um there may be uh
um

01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%

and i'm the president of the new
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire psychiatric society my
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
testimony represents that of the new
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire psychiatric society as well as
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire medical society of
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
which i am an executive council member
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
i wanted to keep my testimony short
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
today to exceed most of my time to
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh tamora o'neil but i also wanted to
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank dr marsh for his leadership on
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
this issue and his enthusiasm in working
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
with us at the new hampshire psychiatric
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
society as well as the office of the
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
child advocate
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
we believe as does dr marsh that it is
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
important to ensure that children in
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
foster care are able to access
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatment for general
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
health and mental health disorders as it
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
pertains to psychotropic medications it
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
is important to note that in many cases
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
as as mora had said these medications
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
are appropriate for mental health
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
disorders in children however we as a
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
state have a shortage of psychiatrists
 
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
and an even more pronounced shortage of
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists with specific child and
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
adolescent training so our work with dr
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
marsh ensures that this bill will
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
protect the welfare of our state's
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
children in foster care while not
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
impeding the ability of physicians to
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
treat children in foster care with
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
evidence-based measures
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
so with that i will leave that there and
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
once again look forward to supporting
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%

01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
um so my testimony is based on as
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
introduced we're happy to work with the
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
folks that have drafted potential
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
amendments um and would welcome them
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
reaching out and working with them on
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
those amendments so that we can help
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
build a better system for kids in foster
 
01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.950 align:start position:0%
build a better system for kids in foster
care

01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
to clarify a couple of the prior points
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
and questions that have already been
 
01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.390 align:start position:0%
and questions that have already been
raised

01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
um with regard to representative long's
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
question about dcyf oversight the way
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
that this would
 
01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:40.390 align:start position:0%
that this would
um

01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
be focused on dc white f having control
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
of the oversight is the statutes that
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
are invoked 169 b c and d as well as 170
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
g those are
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
child protection children in native
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
services and delinquency as well as dcyf
 
01:43:57.119 --> 01:43:58.310 align:start position:0%
services and delinquency as well as dcyf
services

01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.350 align:start position:0%
services
so

01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
by way of including those in
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
this bill it directly connects to dcyf
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
having the responsibilities over these
 
01:44:07.679 --> 01:44:09.990 align:start position:0%
having the responsibilities over these
functions

01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
functions
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
additionally i wanted to
 
01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:14.550 align:start position:0%
additionally i wanted to
provide

01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
a little more information about the
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
doctor at sysc who is available to all
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
of dcyf for consultation it is included
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
in his contract that he will be
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
available for that work and to work with
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
both the dcyf nurses as well as
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
providers to children in the community
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
that was intentionally added into his
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
contract when it was drafted it was it
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
is not just available because of the low
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
census at sysc that was an intentional
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
ask and requirement as we sought to have
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
that doctor engaged for this express
 
01:44:48.639 --> 01:44:49.830 align:start position:0%
that doctor engaged for this express
purpose

01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
taking a step back
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
i want to the committee to understand
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
that the department absolutely
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
recognizes that our responsibility for
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
the monitoring of psychotropic meds for
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
children in foster care is an absolute
 
01:45:02.159 --> 01:45:03.750 align:start position:0%
children in foster care is an absolute
priority

01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
priority
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
however decisions should be based made
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
based on current and accurate
 
01:45:08.239 --> 01:45:09.669 align:start position:0%
based on current and accurate
information

01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
and the oig report uses data that was
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
nearly five years ago so although we're
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the numbers that were in
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
that as the driving force for that bill
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
it's not reflective of where we are
 
01:45:23.199 --> 01:45:24.390 align:start position:0%
it's not reflective of where we are
today

01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
um one of the reasons new hampshire's
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
numbers are
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
high are because we include the chin's
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
population and the delinquency
 
01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.430 align:start position:0%
population and the delinquency
population

01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
in our foster care data most other
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
states do not
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
while even removing that population we
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
recognize we want to do better for the
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
children and youth in our care and are
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue but one of the
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
driving forces under those numbers is
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
the way our data is collected and our
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the entire population
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
in the foster care system
 
01:45:56.719 --> 01:45:57.669 align:start position:0%
in the foster care system
uh

01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
so we have taken a number of steps that
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
have already been discussed by moira and
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
other folks who have testified including
 
01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.669 align:start position:0%
other folks who have testified including
um

01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to add nurses back in
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
through the budget we have nurses added
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
to almost all of the district offices
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
there are a couple more to fill as you
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sure can appreciate during covent
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
has been a difficult time to hire nurses
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
but we
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
um are almost there and those nurses one
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
of their responsibilities under their
 
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
new job descriptions is in fact to
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
monitor psychotropic meds for children
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
in foster care and consult with the
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
doctor at sysc regarding
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
those youth so we believe that is in
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
place it is building it is growing and
 
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:40.790 align:start position:0%
place it is building it is growing and
as

01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
those nurse positions are all filled we
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
will do even better with that um the
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
mcos are also working on this we've
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
built things into their contracts to
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
monitor the use of psychotropic
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
medication for all foster youth um as
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
one of the elements that we monitor
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
through the mcos and we score them and
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
we have compliance measures that have
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
been built into the new contract so we
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
believe that will help improve
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
um this issue as well we have some
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
additional work to do with the
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the mcos and the
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
division and that is underway um i
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out as moira did as well
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
that the definition was not consistent
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
with 126u we believe 126u does
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
prevent that misuse of psychotropic
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
medications as a restraint it already
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
does in the law therefore adding this
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
into 169bc is duplicative um but if it's
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
going to be in both places we would
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
certainly like the definitions to be
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
consistent for implementation purposes
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're just creating
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and confusion
 
01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.030 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and confusion
um

01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
so we believe we've taken a number of
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
steps to do this
 
01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
um that this legislation
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
although well intended it is not
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
required because those places are those
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
pieces are already being built and put
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the administrative
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
reporting while it is set up to go to
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
hhs we do
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
question would like you to consider
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
whether that would be more appropriately
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
directed to the children's oversight
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee um that deals with a lot of
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
issues for this population
 
01:48:22.159 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
issues for this population
and

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:22.490 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:26.870 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
there are a number of items in the
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
reporting that are not currently
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
reported through the medicaid system
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
or reported in the way that they are
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
described in the medicaid system or our
 
01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.310 align:start position:0%
described in the medicaid system or our
um

01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
child welfare information system and
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
we believe it would be a substantial
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
work to get them connected in the way
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
that they are drafted so we would like
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work with folks to
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
decrease the further burden of
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
additional reporting by working with
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
data in a way that we have it and can
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
combine it in a way that gets you the
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
information that you need but does not
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
require manual data tracking that is
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
very time intensive and um
 
01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:11.590 align:start position:0%
very time intensive and um
just

01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary if we have other ways to
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the committee and i'm
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
mr ross
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative long you have a question
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you thank
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
you miss ross so i just want to be well
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
first of all i uh commend the state of
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for including everybody
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's fantastic
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
so what i'm hearing is you're looking
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
for consistency in restraints
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh language and also
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh with reporting correct
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
yes that's right just looking at the
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements to make sure
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
they're feasible um within our current
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
systems that they don't have an
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
unintended cost and burden and that
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
as moira had suggested having the
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
definition match the one that already
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
exists in law
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay and just to follow up if i may uh
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
certainly follow-up
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
yeah the the with respect to with
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
respect to both of those uh
 
01:50:19.119 --> 01:50:20.310 align:start position:0%
respect to both of those uh
language

01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
um can the committee um
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
depend on you and the other parties
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
involved to
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
submit consistent language
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative long we have
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
another question from
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.709 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony you said that this
 
01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:52.390 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony you said that this
is

01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:54.550 align:start position:0%
is
duplicitive

01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
duplicitive
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
or duplic
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
duplicative there we go um um
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
because we have a statute forbidding um
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
the use of psychotropic medications on
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
as a restraint is
 
01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:10.950 align:start position:0%
as a restraint is
so

01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be more broad use of
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications so
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
are you saying that psychotropic
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
medications are only used for restraint
 
01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:25.990 align:start position:0%
medications are only used for restraint
no

01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
this is not necessary as the as the oca
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
explained there are certainly
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate times when they are
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
medically necessary this bill is looking
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
at preventing the use of them for
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
improper restraint and when they're not
 
01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:40.149 align:start position:0%
improper restraint and when they're not
medically

01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
medically
 
01:51:40.159 --> 01:51:41.830 align:start position:0%
medically
necessary

01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.709 align:start position:0%
necessary
and

01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:42.719 --> 01:51:43.510 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
that's already contemplated in
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
rsa126u that prevents the use of
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
improper use of medication restraints
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
and this bill incorporates 126u in each
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
of the sections saying they shall not be
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
used in violation of 126u which is where
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
representative belanger do we have any
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
more hands up
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
we do representative lewicki you have a
 
01:52:17.679 --> 01:52:18.709 align:start position:0%
we do representative lewicki you have a
question

01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
you ms ross um i'm
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh unfamiliar with this and i
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is a general question approximately
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
how many children do we have in dcyf
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
care and what the breakdown is to in
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
foster care in
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
our other places
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
and how many of them are being treated
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
so i think i can get you that
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
information to follow up i don't have it
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
in front of me and don't want to um go
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
from my memory because that would be
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
dangerous right now so
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
i will get you that information we do
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
publish the annual report that has the
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
information about number of children in
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
care as well as our monthly dashboard i
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
will provide the committee with both of
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
those links and highlight that exact
 
01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:04.390 align:start position:0%
those links and highlight that exact
information

01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
and try to collect from medicaid
 
01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:08.229 align:start position:0%
and try to collect from medicaid
that

01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
specific information on psychotropic
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
meds and get it to the committee thank
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay no
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you rebecca you're

center
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to touch on a couple of
 
01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:55.910 align:start position:0%
i just want to touch on a couple of
things

01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:56.790 align:start position:0%
things
um

01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
i won't
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
go over the ground that's already been
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
i want to thank representative martian
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors of the bill i think this
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
is very important
 
01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
legislation to address
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
what i think everyone would agree is a
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
significant issue particularly in light
 
01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:17.850 align:start position:0%
of the report from a few years back
 
01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:19.830 align:start position:0%
of the report from a few years back
[Music]

01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
we support this bill i have not seen the
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
amendment nor the the
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
particulars of
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
recommended changes to the bill that
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
were discussed by
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
director o'neal
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
i did want to comment though on just a
 
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
couple of things just generally
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
um you may know this but i think some
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
people don't that there's an extremely
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
high rate of disability in the child
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
protection system
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
um and there's a lot of um
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know scholarship on
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
about why that is i think it's generally
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
understood that
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
the dynamic
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
um basically runs in both directions the
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
the existence of a disability may create
 
01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.149 align:start position:0%
the existence of a disability may create
vulnerability

01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerability
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
to abuse or trigger abuse or neglect
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
the imposition of maltreatment on a
 
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.430 align:start position:0%
the imposition of maltreatment on a
child

01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
um can cause disability itself
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
so you know it probably make would make
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
sense to you that a child with
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
disability can create stress in the
 
01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:21.990 align:start position:0%
disability can create stress in the
family

01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
a child with disability may be less able
 
01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:24.629 align:start position:0%
a child with disability may be less able
to

01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
apprehend that
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
they are being abused or neglected or
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise defend
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
themselves and i think it should be
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
clear to everyone that being subjected
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
to abuse or neglect or other trauma can
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
cause disability particularly
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
behavioral health disorders so i think
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
especially important
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
that we ensure that children in the
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
system receive appropriate behavioral
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
health care and that includes proper
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and monitoring of treatment i
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
think that should be obvious i think
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the diagnosis issue though is worth
 
01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.109 align:start position:0%
that the diagnosis issue though is worth
pausing

01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
pausing
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
for a moment about
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think that it's in the nature of
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health conditions
 
01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:05.589 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health conditions
that

01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
proper diagnosis depends on
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
collection of information from the
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
child's caregiver
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so many of these children will have
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
come from homes where there was not a
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
reliable caregiver who can describe the
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
child's struggles with a treatment
 
01:56:23.199 --> 01:56:24.870 align:start position:0%
child's struggles with a treatment
provider

01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:25.589 align:start position:0%
provider
so

01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
diagnosis is particularly challenging
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
and the need for careful monitoring of
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
treatment may therefore be especially
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
great because that diagnosis may not uh
 
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
rest on as solid ground as
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh as in other situations involving
 
01:56:40.639 --> 01:56:42.149 align:start position:0%
uh as in other situations involving
children

01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
it may also be particularly important
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
for the health care provider to work
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
closely with the foster family or other
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
caregiver so that their actions align
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
with and support the treatment plan
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
which we can expect to be more
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
challenging in the foster family setting
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
than in the context of an ongoing
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted parental relationship
 
01:57:01.679 --> 01:57:02.629 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted parental relationship
um

01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:02.639 --> 01:57:04.390 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
those were a couple of things i
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.510 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
emphasize

01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
emphasize
 
01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:10.470 align:start position:0%
emphasize
um

01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
i i have not seen the amendments but i
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
my ears perked up when i heard the
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
discussion of possibly
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
um changing the definition of medication
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
restraint and if i misheard i apologize
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
but i'm concerned that
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
the that the committee be cautious about
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
amending the definition of medication
 
01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:30.550 align:start position:0%
amending the definition of medication
restraint

01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
restraint
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
in chapter 126 you itself
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
and i have a bit of post-traumatic
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
stress disorder about the history of
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
that statute because its original
 
01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.109 align:start position:0%
that statute because its original
version

01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
basically had some definitions that
 
01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.950 align:start position:0%
basically had some definitions that
incorporated

01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
incorporated
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
language that made it very easy for the
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
regulated entities to avoid regulation
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
and so if you were considering
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
changing the definition of medication
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
restraint to
 
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
include what the purpose of the
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
medication was
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
i think you need to be very very careful
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
about that and so if that's being
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
contemplated i hope that there will be
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
an open discussion about
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
making sure that we protect the
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
the important uh
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
elements of chapter 126u
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
um with that i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:21.510 align:start position:0%
um with that i'd be happy to answer any
questions

01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair thank you mr
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
skibby um so
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
with respect to the um uh
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
with respect to the um
 
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
assessments there's there's a
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's a recent comprehensive it needs
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
a recent comprehensive medical
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
assessment to rule out an underlying
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
physical cause
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
and a comprehensive
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
psychosocial assessment to address
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
psychosocial issues
 
01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:57.189 align:start position:0%
psychosocial issues
um

01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:57.199 --> 01:58:58.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that's the um
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
you know that that's what
 
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
is needed prior to the
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh prescription
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
a recent comprehensive medical
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
assessment could can you tell me what
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
what what's that time is that six eight
 
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
months two months three months
 
01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:20.870 align:start position:0%
months two months three months
recent

01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
recent
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh well i i that's sort of the standard
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
of care in the health care setting that
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
i really
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
would not be able to speak to with any
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
expertise i would comment though that
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
ruling out
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
physical causes for behavior
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
behavioral symptoms
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
is an extremely important
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
thing to do particularly when you're
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
dealing with children i have a very
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
close relative who was treated for years
 
01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:48.550 align:start position:0%
close relative who was treated for years
for

01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral health issues that turned out
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
to have been related to an untreated
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
infectious disease and i've spoken to
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers in the behavioral
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
health field who
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
about this case and
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
have heard that reinforced many times
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
that it is very
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
common or at least you know it's a
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
frequent occurrence i should say to find
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
that there's a very close relationship
 
02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:16.229 align:start position:0%
that there's a very close relationship
between

02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
medical conditions and behavioral issues
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
that might otherwise not be understood
 
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
to be related to them
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%

house bill 120

along with representative marsha's
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment of today
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
this important legislation can go a long
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
way in the effort to reduce the use of
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications and improve
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
outcomes for children in new hampshire's
 
02:01:48.239 --> 02:01:49.350 align:start position:0%
outcomes for children in new hampshire's
care

02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
certainly similar legislation in other
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
states has shown a dramatic decrease in
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
the use of psychotropic medications
 
02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
i also want to thank representative
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
marsh for bringing this forward
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
prior to my policy work at new futures i
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
spent years working with children in new
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire both as a guardian ad litem
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
and within the residential placement
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
system and the issue of over-medication
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
has always been a matter of serious
 
02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:14.390 align:start position:0%
has always been a matter of serious
concern

02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
the ig's report that was cited by
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative marsh has shown a light
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
on this issue and i'm hopeful that we'll
 
02:02:21.669 --> 02:02:21.679 align:start position:0%
use it to improve the care and treatment
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
of our state's most vulnerable children
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
by tightening oversight and ensuring
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
that every child who is prescribed
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
medication has a proper diagnosis and a
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
corresponding treatment plan we can be
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
more confident that every child
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
in the state's care is retreat receiving
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
the proper care and reach and treatment
 
02:02:40.709 --> 02:02:40.719 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%

03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
stability permanency is important
 
03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
these families also need stability and
 
03:39:28.080 --> 03:39:30.150 align:start position:0%
these families also need stability and
permanency

03:39:30.150 --> 03:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
permanency
 
03:39:32.229 --> 03:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
it does no one any good when they feel
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
like they are floating out in space not
 
03:39:35.590 --> 03:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
knowing what the next steps are going to
 
03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:36.710 align:start position:0%
knowing what the next steps are going to
be

03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
the importance of stability and
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
permanency is always for the best
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
interest of the child let me give you a
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
few examples
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
my nephew
 
03:39:49.030 --> 03:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
who i and my wife have guardianship of
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
and are in the process of the adoption
 
03:39:50.800 --> 03:39:51.990 align:start position:0%
and are in the process of the adoption
list

03:39:51.990 --> 03:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
list
 
03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
are trying uh he has picked his own name
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
so he now prefers to be called teddy
 
03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
i say prefer because we haven't been
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
able to legally change his name yet
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
but my soon-to-be child comes out of his
 
03:40:07.990 --> 03:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
room during the middle of the night
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
or when we're cooking dinner crying
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
beyond belief
 
03:40:16.469 --> 03:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you the pain that it causes
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
me seeing how scared he is
 
03:40:28.150 --> 03:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
and when he tells me hurry up i want you
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
guys to adopt me or why am i not adopted
 
03:40:34.790 --> 03:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
yet i unfortunately have no answers
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
we are moving as fast as we can
 
03:40:39.510 --> 03:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
and for the record my wife and i are in
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
the assessment process and are awaiting
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
the social worker to be assigned to our
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
home study
 
03:40:48.790 --> 03:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
so this bill will not apply to us but
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
i'm putting this bill forward for the
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
many families that are struggling just
 
03:40:54.630 --> 03:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
like we were
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity to streamline the
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
process for these families
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
there may be a statement made today that
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
some would like to see an assessment
 
03:41:04.389 --> 03:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
done either on the front end or the back
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
end but need need i let the committee
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
know that there isn't that isn't there
 
03:41:09.840 --> 03:41:10.870 align:start position:0%
know that there isn't that isn't there
anyways

03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
that part should be addressed in a
 
03:41:14.790 --> 03:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
separate bill regarding when guardians
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
first apply for guardianship in the
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
first place
 
03:41:22.150 --> 03:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
before you see an amendment
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
first line on line five
 
03:41:26.950 --> 03:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
that is struck out is for good cause
 
03:41:26.960 --> 03:41:28.389 align:start position:0%
that is struck out is for good cause
shown

03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
shown
 
03:41:30.870 --> 03:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
the reason why i strike that out
 
03:41:32.790 --> 03:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
or the reason why is struck out in this
 
03:41:32.800 --> 03:41:33.830 align:start position:0%
or the reason why is struck out in this
bill

03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
is because if you are if
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
in lines a and b which are renumbered to
 
03:41:41.750 --> 03:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
one and two and i'll get to that in a
 
03:41:41.760 --> 03:41:43.190 align:start position:0%
one and two and i'll get to that in a
minute

03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
minute
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
these are already the causes shown that
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
an assessment may be waived
 
03:41:50.950 --> 03:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
so there is no further good cause shown
 
03:41:50.960 --> 03:41:52.710 align:start position:0%
so there is no further good cause shown
required

03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
the next
 
03:41:54.080 --> 03:41:55.670 align:start position:0%
the next
uh

03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:41:58.710 --> 03:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
change is on line six you strike out
 
03:41:58.720 --> 03:41:59.750 align:start position:0%
change is on line six you strike out
both

03:41:59.750 --> 03:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
to either instead
 
03:42:02.399 --> 03:42:03.269 align:start position:0%
to either instead
so

03:42:03.269 --> 03:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
the reason why i did that
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
is because
 
03:42:09.750 --> 03:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
lines one and excuse me paragraphs one
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
and two will blend into one and will
 
03:42:15.670 --> 03:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
read the parents of the minor child have
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
surrendered their rights the parents of
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
the minor child are deceased or the
 
03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
parents parental rights have been
 
03:42:21.760 --> 03:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
parents parental rights have been
terminated

03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
terminated
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
and the minor child has resided with the
 
03:42:25.359 --> 03:42:26.710 align:start position:0%
and the minor child has resided with the
petitioners

03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
petitioners
 
03:42:28.469 --> 03:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
which strikes out to whom the child is
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
related that was on the original bill
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
for at least strikeout three two
 
03:42:35.110 --> 03:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
consecutive years
 
03:42:36.830 --> 03:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
prior to filing the petition for
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
adoption that now would become one
 
03:42:39.680 --> 03:42:41.190 align:start position:0%
adoption that now would become one
paragraph

03:42:41.190 --> 03:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
and part b
 
03:42:45.190 --> 03:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
which says or an assessment has
 
03:42:49.190 --> 03:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
completed in the previous three years
 
03:42:51.910 --> 03:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
the reason why i chose two consecutive
 
03:42:51.920 --> 03:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
the reason why i chose two consecutive
years

03:42:53.190 --> 03:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
was excuse me let me back up the reason
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
why i chose to add the parents of the
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
minor are deceased or their parents
 
03:43:01.990 --> 03:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
parental rights have been terminated
 
03:43:04.790 --> 03:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
because not all situations
 
03:43:06.630 --> 03:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
the parent will surrender their parental
 
03:43:09.030 --> 03:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
rights sometimes you have to file for
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
determination in order for their rights
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
to obviously be terminated
 
03:43:17.990 --> 03:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes the parents child are deceased
 
03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:19.110 align:start position:0%
sometimes the parents child are deceased
so

03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:22.150 --> 03:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
in order to make it more broad to apply
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
to different situations because not
 
03:43:26.070 --> 03:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
every situation is the same i chose to
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
when you move down to line 11 for at
 
03:43:36.389 --> 03:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
least three to two consecutive years
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
it was brought to my attention that what
 
03:43:40.950 --> 03:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
about the kids who are in a home for one
 
03:43:40.960 --> 03:43:41.750 align:start position:0%
about the kids who are in a home for one
year

03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh three months uh 12 days
 
03:43:48.790 --> 03:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
and they get replaced with mom and dad
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
go back to potentially the
 
03:43:55.750 --> 03:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
petitioning adopted parents
 
03:43:58.469 --> 03:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
that may or may not always be the case
 
03:44:00.150 --> 03:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i would ask
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
i would refer that question to
 
03:44:04.150 --> 03:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
miss ross who is on
 
03:44:04.160 --> 03:44:05.189 align:start position:0%
miss ross who is on
um

03:44:05.189 --> 03:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
how often
 
03:44:08.950 --> 03:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
that would happen but this would mainly
 
03:44:10.229 --> 03:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
03:44:10.239 --> 03:44:12.070 align:start position:0%
apply to
um

03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:14.469 --> 03:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
adopt private adoptions and she will
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
address that as well
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
and then the reason why i added line 12
 
03:44:22.630 --> 03:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
that an assessment has been completed in
 
03:44:24.389 --> 03:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
the previous three years
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
is again
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
some of these parents
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
or soon to be adoptive parents whether
 
03:44:31.830 --> 03:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
they're a relative or not
 
03:44:33.030 --> 03:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
may feel
 
03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
that they have no idea
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
the undertaking they are bringing into
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
their home
 
03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
and the care and quality of life that
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
these children need so they may take for
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
example a foster parent class to better
 
03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:47.189 align:start position:0%
example a foster parent class to better
understand

03:44:47.189 --> 03:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
at risk youth
 
03:44:48.960 --> 03:44:49.750 align:start position:0%
at risk youth
so

03:44:49.750 --> 03:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
during that foster
 
03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
if they choose to become foster parent
 
03:44:54.479 --> 03:44:56.150 align:start position:0%
if they choose to become foster parent
licensed

03:44:56.150 --> 03:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
03:44:58.710 --> 03:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
there is an assessment there
 
03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
it is a very different assessment but it
 
03:45:04.870 --> 03:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
what an assessment consists of

so an assessment i
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
i heard you say that an assessment that
 
03:47:09.110 --> 03:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
there was two you referenced
 
03:47:11.429 --> 03:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
um so it would be any assessment like an
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
iep or
 
03:47:16.630 --> 03:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
whatever i mean it says an assessment so
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
i i i don't know if there are other
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
qualifications of assessments that the
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
court could deem
 
03:47:25.189 --> 03:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
is qualifying
 
03:47:27.189 --> 03:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh to if if i can answer your question
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative long thank you um and
 
03:47:30.630 --> 03:47:30.640 align:start position:0%

03:47:36.309 --> 03:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh if you read further to bill
 
03:47:38.870 --> 03:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
the bill excuse me excuse me if you
 
03:47:40.950 --> 03:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
further the rsa
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
there are certain outlines that is
 
03:47:42.960 --> 03:47:44.870 align:start position:0%
there are certain outlines that is
required

03:47:44.870 --> 03:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:47:47.429 --> 03:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
and considered an assessment so if i
 
03:47:49.750 --> 03:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
give my child an iep assessment that's
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
not considered a statutory assessment
 
03:47:56.550 --> 03:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
for a quote home study unquote
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
it has to be this is part
 
03:48:02.309 --> 03:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
you could put the term home study in the
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
assessment and it i believe it is uh
 
03:48:07.110 --> 03:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
quoted in the rsa but when you talk
 
03:48:09.030 --> 03:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
about an assessment in this bill which
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
is statutory statutorily explained
 
03:48:14.790 --> 03:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the rsa which is 170
 
03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:16.870 align:start position:0%
throughout the rsa which is 170
um

03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:18.790 --> 03:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
it is very specific as to the
 
03:48:22.150 --> 03:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
requirements um needed in an assessment
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
quote home study unquote
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%

chair

03:48:28.870 --> 03:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
follow up sure uh and then in that
 
03:48:34.150 --> 03:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
in that an assessment would also include
 
03:48:34.160 --> 03:48:36.229 align:start position:0%
in that an assessment would also include
uh

03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:48:39.030 --> 03:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
your licensing qualifications
 
03:48:43.990 --> 03:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
is that what i heard
 
03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's not me calling um
 
03:48:47.840 --> 03:48:50.150 align:start position:0%
it's not me calling um
so

03:48:50.150 --> 03:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah let me try to explain so
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
if you were a licensed foster parent
 
03:48:59.429 --> 03:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
given a license
 
03:49:01.910 --> 03:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
provided to you by dcyf
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
you are there is an assessment that goes
 
03:49:10.710 --> 03:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
or actually uh
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
another thought come to mind
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
if say i've had the child in my home for
 
03:49:19.750 --> 03:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
two years we are petitioning for
 
03:49:22.630 --> 03:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
adoption we are we've had the home study
 
03:49:25.910 --> 03:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
done but for whatever reason a child may
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
be replaced with the parents
 
03:49:31.110 --> 03:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
and then that doesn't work out um
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
the assessment would apply for that as
 
03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:33.750 align:start position:0%
the assessment would apply for that as
well

03:49:33.750 --> 03:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:49:33.760 --> 03:49:35.670 align:start position:0%
well
but

03:49:35.670 --> 03:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
private guardians do not by
 
03:49:40.710 --> 03:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
by petition to the court for
 
03:49:40.720 --> 03:49:42.150 align:start position:0%
by petition to the court for
guardianship

03:49:42.150 --> 03:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
guardianship
 
03:49:43.349 --> 03:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
do not
 
03:49:43.359 --> 03:49:44.389 align:start position:0%
do not
have

03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:49:47.429 --> 03:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
foster parent licenses and an assessment
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't give that license to private
 
03:49:49.199 --> 03:49:50.630 align:start position:0%
doesn't give that license to private
guardians

03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
guardians
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
i think i answered your question
 
03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah no you did yep um
 
03:49:58.469 --> 03:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
and just follow up i may uh madam chair
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
yeah just um
 
03:50:02.070 --> 03:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
03:50:04.950 --> 03:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
the striking of uh to whom the child is
 
03:50:07.189 --> 03:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
related i
 
03:50:09.349 --> 03:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think i understand that has to why
 
03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
should it just be related children
 
03:50:14.150 --> 03:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:16.150 --> 03:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
is that the reason for striking that out
 
03:50:16.160 --> 03:50:16.870 align:start position:0%
is that the reason for striking that out
so

03:50:16.870 --> 03:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
in my case the child is related to me
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
but again this bill even if it passed
 
03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
tomorrow would not apply as i'm
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
currently in the process
 
03:50:26.070 --> 03:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
nor would i accept
 
03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:26.870 align:start position:0%
nor would i accept
this

03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
um as i consider it a conflict of
 
03:50:30.630 --> 03:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
interest to
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
but anyway to whom the child is related
 
03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
on line 10
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
striking that out
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
let me give you an example
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
prior to my nephew coming to live with
 
03:50:40.319 --> 03:50:41.110 align:start position:0%
prior to my nephew coming to live with
us

03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:50:42.790 --> 03:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
he lived with my
 
03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
what we consider his pseudo grandparents
 
03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
he lived with them for about two and a
 
03:50:49.349 --> 03:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
half years this was in vermont and
 
03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately vermont's laws are not new
 
03:50:53.110 --> 03:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire well maybe not unfortunately
 
03:50:54.550 --> 03:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
but vermont's laws are very different
 
03:50:56.229 --> 03:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire law
 
03:50:56.239 --> 03:50:58.070 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire law
and

03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
she couldn't do anything to obtain
 
03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
custody of my nephew but had they lived
 
03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and this bill would
 
03:51:05.600 --> 03:51:06.389 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and this bill would
have

03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
been enacted
 
03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to be the petitioning
 
03:51:11.990 --> 03:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
adoptees this bill would be able to
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
apply to them
 
03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
not every situation the child is living
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
with a relative but that may be the best
 
03:51:20.150 --> 03:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
place for the child to be
 
03:51:22.950 --> 03:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh and i do want to drop one more
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
comment uh mr long and i and i
 
03:51:27.750 --> 03:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the questions um but uh one
 
03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
thing to add is in all guardianship
 
03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
cases when or excuse me in all adoption
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
cases a gal is appointed by the court
 
03:51:36.790 --> 03:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
and as i eluded yesterday i was able to
 
03:51:39.429 --> 03:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
petition for my own so that gil still
 
03:51:39.439 --> 03:51:40.710 align:start position:0%
petition for my own so that gil still
requires

03:51:40.710 --> 03:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
requires
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me is still required to draft a
 
03:51:46.150 --> 03:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
court summary as to what is in the best
 
03:51:48.229 --> 03:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
interest of the child so that is still
 
03:51:51.429 --> 03:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.870 --> 03:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wrong
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
next gabby grossman has a question go
 
03:52:01.830 --> 03:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
ahead gabby
 
03:52:03.830 --> 03:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative belanger for bringing
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
03:52:09.030 --> 03:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
we've been involved
 
03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
with adoption cases with families and
 
03:52:13.590 --> 03:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
our house has been used as a visitation
 
03:52:13.600 --> 03:52:14.870 align:start position:0%
our house has been used as a visitation
site

03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
site
 
03:52:18.070 --> 03:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
so this is near and dear to me
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
my only concern so
 
03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
private guardians
 
03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
ensuring that there is a home study at
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
some point so children
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:37.349 --> 03:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
making sure that someone is looking at
 
03:52:39.189 --> 03:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
the home
 
03:52:41.189 --> 03:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
when you listed the licensed foster
 
03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
parent is that is there's a home study
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
in that but private guardians is there a
 
03:52:49.670 --> 03:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:49.680 --> 03:52:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:52:50.550 --> 03:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:52:55.030 --> 03:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
and again as i stated in my statement
 
03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
i do intend to
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
draft a separate bill next session that
 
03:53:00.550 --> 03:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
would address that
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
but that won't apply here
 
03:53:02.640 --> 03:53:03.830 align:start position:0%
but that won't apply here
when

03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'll use myself as an example
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
when i filed for guardianship of my
 
03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:09.269 align:start position:0%
when i filed for guardianship of my
nephew

03:53:09.269 --> 03:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
nephew
 
03:53:11.269 --> 03:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
i thought that i would get some sort of
 
03:53:13.349 --> 03:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
background check
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
03:53:15.600 --> 03:53:18.630 align:start position:0%
i didn't
um

03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.269 --> 03:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
i do plan to address that but
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
the intent behind this bill is just to
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
reduce a number from three to two
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
um i do think that there should be at
 
03:53:29.040 --> 03:53:30.150 align:start position:0%
um i do think that there should be at
minimum

03:53:30.150 --> 03:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
03:53:32.710 --> 03:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
when applying for guardianship
 
03:53:34.950 --> 03:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
as this person would be taking on a
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
child that a background check and other
 
03:53:40.630 --> 03:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
checks should be made such as no abuse
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
and neglect charges have been brought or
 
03:53:45.670 --> 03:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
potentially put on that person as well
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
as potentially a sex offender check
 
03:53:48.950 --> 03:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
but again that that needs to be
 
03:53:52.870 --> 03:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
addressed on the guardianship side which
 
03:53:54.309 --> 03:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
is a separate
 
03:53:54.319 --> 03:53:55.189 align:start position:0%
is a separate
issue

03:53:55.189 --> 03:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:54:00.150 --> 03:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:02.630 --> 03:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair can i ask a follow-up
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.710 --> 03:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.720 --> 03:54:14.309 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:54:14.309 --> 03:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's three years or two years is
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
there a home study
 
03:54:23.189 --> 03:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
does anyone go visit the home
 
03:54:27.750 --> 03:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:31.030 --> 03:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
in the process has anyone come
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
is it part of the process that somebody
 
03:54:36.150 --> 03:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
goes into the physical home so not just
 
03:54:36.160 --> 03:54:38.070 align:start position:0%
goes into the physical home so not just
um

03:54:38.070 --> 03:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:38.080 --> 03:54:42.389 align:start position:0%
um
record

03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm losing my thought i just i
 
03:54:46.229 --> 03:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
think i got what you were trying to say
 
03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
physically going
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
to to ensure
 
03:54:53.830 --> 03:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
that the home is a safe place because
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
the child
 
03:54:58.229 --> 03:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
may think it's a safe but it may not be
 
03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
and the child at that time may not have
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
the judgment but who is insuring from
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
that we're placing these children
 
03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
being that a home study
 
03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
home assassin shall not be required
 
03:55:18.080 --> 03:55:19.510 align:start position:0%
home assassin shall not be required
so

03:55:19.510 --> 03:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
guardianship case when dcyf is not
 
03:55:23.359 --> 03:55:25.590 align:start position:0%
guardianship case when dcyf is not
involved

03:55:25.590 --> 03:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
involved
 
03:55:26.950 --> 03:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
short answer
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
no one
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
long answer
 
03:55:30.640 --> 03:55:31.990 align:start position:0%
long answer
is

03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
if in
 
03:55:36.790 --> 03:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
if that person who is fight now remember
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
this only applies to the petitioning
 
03:55:41.670 --> 03:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
adoptive parents
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
if my nephew didn't live with me and i'm
 
03:55:43.920 --> 03:55:44.950 align:start position:0%
if my nephew didn't live with me and i'm
not

03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
applying for a petition this would not
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
apply and i could not have it assessed
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
or waived excuse me
 
03:55:52.640 --> 03:55:54.830 align:start position:0%
or waived excuse me
so

03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:57.510 --> 03:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
um geez i just lost my train of thought
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um i
 
03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
i believe you said it if in
 
03:56:05.429 --> 03:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
if in so anything under currently where
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
the way that the law is right now three
 
03:56:07.680 --> 03:56:08.790 align:start position:0%
the way that the law is right now three
years

03:56:08.790 --> 03:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
um there has been nobody that has come
 
03:56:13.030 --> 03:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
to my home so my wife and i will have
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
custody of my nephew three years this
 
03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:16.150 align:start position:0%
custody of my nephew three years this
august

03:56:16.150 --> 03:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
august
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
in since obtaining custody in august of
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
2018 we have never seen an individual
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
visit our home to check to see if it's
 
03:56:25.439 --> 03:56:28.469 align:start position:0%
visit our home to check to see if it's
safe

03:56:28.469 --> 03:56:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.750 --> 03:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
now while i do own a very safe home
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
and again should be addressed in another
 
03:56:37.030 --> 03:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
separate rsa
 
03:56:38.710 --> 03:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i will get there

this correctly representative belanger
 
03:59:10.630 --> 03:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
in section six directly after five
 
03:59:10.640 --> 03:59:11.750 align:start position:0%
in section six directly after five
section

03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:59:13.110 --> 03:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
6 says
 
03:59:13.120 --> 03:59:14.630 align:start position:0%
6 says
notwithstanding

03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
any of the above requirements the court
 
03:59:19.750 --> 03:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
shall require a background check in all
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
private adoption proceedings if there
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
has not been an assessment so
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
with your
 
03:59:26.479 --> 03:59:28.150 align:start position:0%
with your
amendment

03:59:28.150 --> 03:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
there's an either or
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
as discretion to order that background
 
03:59:32.640 --> 03:59:33.750 align:start position:0%
as discretion to order that background
check

03:59:33.750 --> 03:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
check
 
03:59:35.110 --> 03:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so a background check is not the
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
same thing as an assessment um the
 
03:59:38.790 --> 03:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
background check is just getting your
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
fingerprints done at the uh
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
the the your local police department so
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
i did not want to touch that because i
 
03:59:49.110 --> 03:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:50.950 --> 03:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry one of the just just to
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
clarify madam cheer um i'm sorry i
 
03:59:56.229 --> 03:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
should have clarified representative
 
03:59:56.239 --> 03:59:58.389 align:start position:0%
should have clarified representative
belanger

03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
belanger
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
within the statute itself for those who
 
04:00:03.269 --> 04:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
are not looking at it i think it says
 
04:00:05.429 --> 04:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
the background check shall include a
 
04:00:08.229 --> 04:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
criminal records check and a search of
 
04:00:10.309 --> 04:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
the abuse and neglect registry
 
04:00:12.790 --> 04:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
maintained by the department
 
04:00:13.750 --> 04:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
all of that actually none of that is
 
04:00:16.239 --> 04:00:17.429 align:start position:0%
all of that actually none of that is
changed

04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
changed
 
04:00:20.469 --> 04:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
with your amendment to section
 
04:00:20.479 --> 04:00:21.510 align:start position:0%
with your amendment to section
five

04:00:21.510 --> 04:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:00:24.389 --> 04:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
correct it does not supersede section
 
04:00:24.399 --> 04:00:25.670 align:start position:0%
correct it does not supersede section
six

04:00:25.670 --> 04:00:25.680 align:start position:0%

is
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
it not the case that if um there is a
 
04:00:55.830 --> 04:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
private adoption then the
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is assuming that the um
 
04:01:02.830 --> 04:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
the parental rights have not been
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
terminated and therefore
 
04:01:05.760 --> 04:01:06.710 align:start position:0%
terminated and therefore
um

04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:06.720 --> 04:01:07.990 align:start position:0%

04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of making sure that
 
04:01:11.590 --> 04:01:11.600 align:start position:0%

representative thank you um if what
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're if i believe what you're saying
 
04:02:26.389 --> 04:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
is that is the responsibility of the
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
adoptive parent to provide a safe and
 
04:02:32.710 --> 04:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
no no
 
04:02:36.630 --> 04:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
yes i mean obviously that that is the
 
04:02:38.710 --> 04:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
case but i'm talking about
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
who is responsible for making sure that
 
04:02:45.189 --> 04:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
the um the new adoptive parents are
 
04:02:47.910 --> 04:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
um providing that safe location is that
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
the current guardian and because the um
 
04:02:53.910 --> 04:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
because the state has not taken control
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
of that uh guardianship right
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
that would be the guardian at lightham
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
so in any private
 
04:03:01.199 --> 04:03:02.070 align:start position:0%
so in any private
so

04:03:02.070 --> 04:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:05.189 --> 04:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
i i think i may have misspoke in the
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
going on three years that we have had
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
custody of my nephew there has been no
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
one as guardians come to our home in
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
check however a guardian at lightham
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
could technically visit the home
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
and provide
 
04:03:21.510 --> 04:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
not an assessment that's probably not
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
the right term to use there but provide
 
04:03:24.000 --> 04:03:25.269 align:start position:0%
the right term to use there but provide
and

04:03:25.269 --> 04:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:27.030 --> 04:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
look out if you will
 
04:03:28.950 --> 04:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
of the conditions in which the home they
 
04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and in that she would
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
provide that copy to the report to the
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%

04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%

representing waypoint
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank the bill's sponsor
 
04:04:38.710 --> 04:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
for the work he's done in this
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and the way he's reached out
 
04:04:43.590 --> 04:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
to folks who've had questions and tried
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
to remedy the concerns he's done a
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
significant amount of work on this and i
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
don't want my comments to reflect
 
04:04:53.189 --> 04:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
anything other than respect for his work
 
04:04:53.199 --> 04:04:54.070 align:start position:0%
anything other than respect for his work
um

04:04:54.070 --> 04:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
one when we reached out internally in
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
waypoint to the
 
04:04:58.800 --> 04:04:59.750 align:start position:0%
waypoint to the
um

04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
to the clinicians who run our foster
 
04:05:03.910 --> 04:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
adoption program when this bill came
 
04:05:05.349 --> 04:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
forward and talked to the bill about
 
04:05:05.359 --> 04:05:06.309 align:start position:0%
forward and talked to the bill about
them

04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
talked about the bill with them
 
04:05:11.670 --> 04:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
there was one issue that they raised
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
that i we are concerned
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
is not remedied by the proposed
 
04:05:15.840 --> 04:05:17.349 align:start position:0%
is not remedied by the proposed
amendment

04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that is a situation
 
04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
where a family member
 
04:05:22.000 --> 04:05:22.870 align:start position:0%
where a family member
will

04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
self-place drop off if you will
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
whatever verb you'd like to use a child
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
in those situations
 
04:05:39.030 --> 04:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
if adoption is accomplished the way the
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
bill discusses
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
it is possible that that home would not
 
04:05:46.870 --> 04:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
have any home study
 
04:05:50.229 --> 04:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
either at the beginning or at the end
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's something that we that we think
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
is a concern
 
04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
we think it's easily remedied
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
but wanted to raise it as a concern
 
04:06:03.189 --> 04:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
and the suggestion would be in the
 
04:06:06.070 --> 04:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
amended language
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
rather than the or
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
between b and c
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
if we replace the ore with an and
 
04:06:16.229 --> 04:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
we believe that would remedy the um the
 
04:06:16.239 --> 04:06:18.870 align:start position:0%
we believe that would remedy the um the
concern

04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
and with that i i will conclude my
 
04:06:20.960 --> 04:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
and with that i i will conclude my
testimony

04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:26.469 --> 04:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr dejoy um will you take
 
04:06:26.479 --> 04:06:27.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr dejoy um will you take
questions

04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
of course
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative all children
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
you are welcome to ask your question
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you mr
 
04:06:38.229 --> 04:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
joy for
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
entertaining my question so
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the event
 
04:06:42.560 --> 04:06:43.429 align:start position:0%
in the event
um

04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the the your hypothetical with uh
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
somebody self-placing you know choosing
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
a family member to
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
place their child with um
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
would it
 
04:06:57.429 --> 04:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
would not
 
04:07:01.030 --> 04:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
section uh 5a still apply that there
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
would have to be a termination
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
or a surrender of the parental rights
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
through the courts and would not not
 
04:07:10.630 --> 04:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
trigger having a home assessment of
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
where that child was when someone
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%

04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
when i spoke to our
 
04:09:08.469 --> 04:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
adoption department i didn't get into
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
that level of detail it was more you
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
know how how should we approach this
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
bill so it's much a much higher level
 
04:09:16.870 --> 04:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to talk to our adoption
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
department and get a response for you
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr dejoy i see no further
 
04:09:27.359 --> 04:09:28.710 align:start position:0%
thank you mr dejoy i see no further
questions

04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:09:30.389 --> 04:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
i see oh
 
04:09:37.990 --> 04:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:09:41.189 --> 04:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
for recognizing me and thank you for
 
04:09:42.630 --> 04:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:09:42.640 --> 04:09:43.590 align:start position:0%
taking the question
um

04:09:43.590 --> 04:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
kind of on the same topic that i just um
 
04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned especially since you are uh
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh speaking to that isn't it uh so
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying that in
 
04:09:58.229 --> 04:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
private adoption situations
 
04:09:58.239 --> 04:09:59.429 align:start position:0%
private adoption situations
um

04:09:59.429 --> 04:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
that the current current guardian
 
04:10:01.439 --> 04:10:02.870 align:start position:0%
that the current current guardian
essentially

04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
04:10:06.710 --> 04:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
places the child in what they believe to
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
be a suitable home and you're
 
04:10:09.840 --> 04:10:11.110 align:start position:0%
be a suitable home and you're
statement

04:10:11.110 --> 04:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
statement
 
04:10:14.150 --> 04:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
seems to be that the government needs to
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
go and double check that even though
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
their rights have not been terminated
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
yet is that is that your position
 
04:10:22.309 --> 04:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh not exactly representative thank you
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
for the question um what i what i was
 
04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
referring to is not private adoptions
 
04:10:27.630 --> 04:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
what i was
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
referring to is unofficial placements
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
where a particular family member for
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
whatever personal reason
 
04:10:37.030 --> 04:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
will decide they cannot properly care
 
04:10:38.710 --> 04:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
for their child and will place that
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
child with another family member
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
we believe it it is
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
it is typically
 
04:10:45.760 --> 04:10:46.870 align:start position:0%
it is typically
preferable

04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
preferable
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
for a family member to care for another
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
for a child of the family
 
04:10:53.110 --> 04:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
our concern though comes in with these
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
unofficial placements
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
if it moves to
 
04:11:00.389 --> 04:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
a permanent to an adoption
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the adoptive family
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
might not have any scrutiny
 
04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that private
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
adoptions have it have a formal process
 
04:11:23.349 --> 04:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:11:28.150 --> 04:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give it 30 seconds to see
 
04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
if anybody's quick and puts their hand
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
up i don't want to miss anybody's
 
04:11:36.150 --> 04:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.309 --> 04:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
gabby grossman
 
04:11:42.150 --> 04:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
there you go go ahead
 
04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you mr
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
joy it's so good to hear you not see you
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
but good to hear you
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative it's nice to be
 
04:11:52.229 --> 04:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
here with the committee as well
 
04:11:52.239 --> 04:11:53.349 align:start position:0%
here with the committee as well
um

04:11:53.349 --> 04:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
so in those unofficial placements
 
04:11:59.110 --> 04:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
where maybe um parental rights haven't
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
been surrendered
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
the unofficial placements is there dcyf
 
04:12:02.960 --> 04:12:06.950 align:start position:0%
the unofficial placements is there dcyf
involvement

04:12:06.950 --> 04:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
when there is when there is some formal
 
04:12:12.870 --> 04:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
involvement we're less concerned
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's when there's no dcyf involvement
 
04:12:19.110 --> 04:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
that we're that we're concerned
 
04:12:21.670 --> 04:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
so the illustration that was given to me
 
04:12:25.110 --> 04:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
is a family member has a particular
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
personal crisis
 
04:12:26.800 --> 04:12:27.910 align:start position:0%
personal crisis
can't

04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
cannot care for their child and decide
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
that aunt uncle grandmother brother
 
04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
sister whomever
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
here i needed i need you to
 
04:12:39.189 --> 04:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for my kid i can't
 
04:12:40.710 --> 04:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
do it
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
and that parent at some point
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
just doesn't come back
 
04:12:48.550 --> 04:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:50.950 --> 04:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
and the custodial
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:55.520 --> 04:12:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:12:57.189 --> 04:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to purport that this is a
 
04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
that this is a frequent occurrence what
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to suggest it that is that
 
04:13:06.070 --> 04:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
this is a potential occurrence that
 
04:13:09.910 --> 04:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:11.110 --> 04:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you another question from
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
question um so
 
04:13:21.199 --> 04:13:23.269 align:start position:0%
question um so
currently

04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:13:23.279 --> 04:13:24.070 align:start position:0%
currently
if

04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh the private placement happens and um
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
the three years
 
04:13:30.800 --> 04:13:32.149 align:start position:0%
the three years
um

04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the child is with them for three years
 
04:13:37.990 --> 04:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
no assessment is required but you
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
you're trying to also chan change that
 
04:13:40.560 --> 04:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
you're trying to also chan change that
policy

04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:13:43.110 --> 04:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:13:45.110 --> 04:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
with this change right
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
because it's currently not required if
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
they're with them for three years
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
um but you're suggesting that it should
 
04:13:55.030 --> 04:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
be changed to require that now
 
04:13:55.040 --> 04:13:57.670 align:start position:0%
be changed to require that now
right

04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.680 --> 04:13:58.469 align:start position:0%
 
we

04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that many families who foster
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
have an assessment of their home done
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
before they begin fostering
 
04:14:08.469 --> 04:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
other families when they adopt
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
have a home assessment
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
what we're suggesting is that it ought
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
not to be both
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
but it should be at least one or the
 
04:14:16.479 --> 04:14:22.870 align:start position:0%
but it should be at least one or the
other

04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions from mr dejoy
 
04:14:32.710 --> 04:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr de joy for your testimony
 
04:14:35.670 --> 04:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
and the answers to questions
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:14:41.110 --> 04:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you next we'll hear from rebecca
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair and members
 
04:14:50.950 --> 04:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for the
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony for the
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
record my name is rebecca ross i'm
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
general counsel and legislative liaison
 
04:14:59.110 --> 04:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
for the division for children youth and
 
04:14:59.120 --> 04:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
for the division for children youth and
families

04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:15:03.110 --> 04:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
the division takes no position on this
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill partly because we do not
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
believe that it would impact
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
dcyf related cases
 
04:15:11.359 --> 04:15:12.309 align:start position:0%
dcyf related cases
um

04:15:12.309 --> 04:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:14.469 --> 04:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of
 
04:15:14.479 --> 04:15:15.429 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of
different

04:15:15.429 --> 04:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
um discussion about various parts of the
 
04:15:20.229 --> 04:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
system i'd like to provide some
 
04:15:20.239 --> 04:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
system i'd like to provide some
clarification

04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
as to the roles responsibilities and the
 
04:15:27.750 --> 04:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
process and how this fits into that
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
um so you can understand why we do not
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
believe it applies to dcyf related cases
 
04:15:37.110 --> 04:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
um in the first instance to clarify
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
guardianship when there is a private
 
04:15:42.149 --> 04:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
guardianship um
 
04:15:46.149 --> 04:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
dcyf is involved in that we receive a
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
request for a check of our central
 
04:15:50.550 --> 04:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
registry directly from the court when
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
anyone files a petition for guardianship
 
04:15:55.149 --> 04:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
of a minor under rsa
 
04:15:55.159 --> 04:15:56.870 align:start position:0%
of a minor under rsa
463

04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
463
 
04:15:59.990 --> 04:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
um they're required to give consent to
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
be checked on the adult registry that
 
04:16:04.389 --> 04:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
goes through elderly and adult services
 
04:16:06.149 --> 04:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
a criminal records check through state
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
police and a central registry check for
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
us we process um
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
i just checked the number and i
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
apologize i forget but hundreds and
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds of those a year for the courts
 
04:16:21.269 --> 04:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
um and send them directly back to the
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
court so everyone who's appointed a
 
04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
private guardian through the judicial
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
branch is checked on our central
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
registry if they are seeking to be the
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
guardian over a minor um and that is the
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
level of our involvement if it's a
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
private guardianship case
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
um in cases where dcyf is involved we
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
look at homes at a number of different
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
times and places throughout a case one
 
04:16:47.590 --> 04:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
if someone is seeking foster care
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
licensure we do a look at the home for
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the license
 
04:16:55.590 --> 04:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
if they become licensed at the time
 
04:16:58.469 --> 04:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
they replace a child there are eyes on
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
that home as well
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
further if the case does move to
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights and
 
04:17:07.030 --> 04:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
reunification is not successful then we
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
do an adoption home study which is
 
04:17:11.110 --> 04:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
looking at is this
 
04:17:11.120 --> 04:17:12.149 align:start position:0%
looking at is this
home

04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
the in the best interest of the child
 
04:17:16.870 --> 04:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
for permanency and
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
to make it their permanent family so we
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
are looking at that home at a number of
 
04:17:23.189 --> 04:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
different times with different lenses
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the life of a case
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
if we are not involved and it is
 
04:17:28.800 --> 04:17:29.910 align:start position:0%
if we are not involved and it is
um

04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:32.950 --> 04:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
a private guardianship and a
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
private adoption
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
then our involvement
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
is by way of licensing child placing
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
agencies who are regulated under 170e
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
and under our administrative rules hec
 
04:17:46.960 --> 04:17:48.710 align:start position:0%
and under our administrative rules hec
6448

04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
6448
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
which require the elements of that home
 
04:17:54.710 --> 04:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
study and that that study is looking at
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
for adoption purposes the the best
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
option for permanent theme adoption they
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
also do home studies for foster
 
04:18:04.239 --> 04:18:05.510 align:start position:0%
also do home studies for foster
placements

04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
placements
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
um under that child placing agency
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
license so it's very complicated but the
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
times and places that the division or
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
licensed child placing agency is
 
04:18:15.520 --> 04:18:16.710 align:start position:0%
licensed child placing agency is
involved

04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
involved
 
04:18:16.720 --> 04:18:17.670 align:start position:0%
involved
but

04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:18:19.910 --> 04:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
we believe this does not touch on most
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
of those areas
 
04:18:21.359 --> 04:18:22.149 align:start position:0%
of those areas
and

04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:25.990 --> 04:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is tailored to the cases where
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
um it is in fact a private adoption dcyf
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
has not been involved it is not a
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
licensed foster home
 
04:18:33.680 --> 04:18:34.469 align:start position:0%
licensed foster home
um

04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
the court
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
through the judicial branch has
 
04:18:42.149 --> 04:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
vetted that home has agreed to placement
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
has required annual reports and reviews
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
to go back before the court
 
04:18:49.269 --> 04:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
and then considers the adoption petition
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
under this statute um i'm happy to
 
04:18:53.510 --> 04:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but i hope that
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
provides some clarity
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have any questions gabby
 
04:19:03.269 --> 04:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
grossman you have a question
 
04:19:05.830 --> 04:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and um
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify in
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the last sentence you just said in a
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
private adoption
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
04:19:18.550 --> 04:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
overseas that home study before before
 
04:19:22.870 --> 04:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
yes the judicial branch is the one that
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
requires it and sees it um when a
 
04:19:30.389 --> 04:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
petition is filed it is the law that
 
04:19:33.189 --> 04:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
requires it to happen or
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
be waived under certain circumstances so
 
04:19:38.469 --> 04:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
dcyf is not involved
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
other than being the entity that
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
regulates child placing agencies who may
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
be doing that assessment
 
04:19:47.910 --> 04:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
04:19:49.830 --> 04:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative all schiller
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
04:20:00.309 --> 04:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
miss ross for taking my question
 
04:20:02.550 --> 04:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
my question is with reference you just
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
made a reference in your testimony to
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
the judicial
 
04:20:06.000 --> 04:20:06.870 align:start position:0%
the judicial
uh

04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:08.950 --> 04:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
to rules and the
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
statute that you follow and i'm looking
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
at 170
 
04:20:17.110 --> 04:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
and it looks like in 170 c9 there is a
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
social study prior to disposition
 
04:20:22.389 --> 04:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
is that what you're referring to that a
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
social study is made by the department
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
of health and human services or another
 
04:20:26.960 --> 04:20:28.710 align:start position:0%
of health and human services or another
agency

04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
so that is the social study that is done
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
under 170 c when we are petitioning for
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights
 
04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
additionally under 170 b if we were um
 
04:20:40.640 --> 04:20:41.750 align:start position:0%
additionally under 170 b if we were um
doing

04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
the petition for adoption
 
04:20:46.149 --> 04:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
following a termination of parental
 
04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
rights we would an adoption home study
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
specific to that home
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
and the statutory requirements under
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
170b so we certainly do that that study
 
04:20:57.189 --> 04:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
under 170c when we're trying to meet our
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
burden under termination and provide an
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
adoption study report at the time of the
 
04:21:03.750 --> 04:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
adoption matter
 
04:21:05.830 --> 04:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
and follow-up chair
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you so just to
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on on uh on that
 
04:21:12.000 --> 04:21:14.469 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on on uh on that
thread

04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
as this bill is written and i'm just
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
dealing i'm i'm looking at the amendment
 
04:21:21.269 --> 04:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
but also
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the original
 
04:21:23.760 --> 04:21:26.710 align:start position:0%
in the original
um

04:21:26.710 --> 04:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
if either of the following circumstances
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
are met the parents of the minor child
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
have surrendered their parental rights
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
minor child are deceased
 
04:21:43.189 --> 04:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
or the parents parental rights have been
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
terminated so under surrender
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
and terminate
 
04:21:51.110 --> 04:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
back up under deceased
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
would dcyf not be working with probate
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
and under the probate courts and under
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
surrender of rights and termination of
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
rights would not dcif be involved with
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
that child
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
not in all of the cases no for example
 
04:22:10.229 --> 04:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
if the parents die and a grandparent

good afternoon madam chair and members
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
04:25:13.439 --> 04:25:14.790 align:start position:0%
of the committee
um

04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
i introduced house bill 562 and what i
 
04:25:21.030 --> 04:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
would like to respectfully request
 
04:25:23.910 --> 04:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
is that the committee retained the bill
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
um the reason why i'm asking for a
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
retention is simply because
 
04:25:30.870 --> 04:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
last week
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
hhs got in touch with me we had a
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
conversation at the end of the week
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
with their concerns
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
we were going to amend the bill
 
04:25:45.199 --> 04:25:46.710 align:start position:0%
we were going to amend the bill
but

04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
i was contacted by other people with
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
other concerns and so we mutually agreed
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
that if we could have time to work on
 
04:25:57.990 --> 04:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
the bill collectively
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
that it would improve it and make it
 
04:26:03.189 --> 04:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
better and therefore we're asking for a
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:26:20.790 --> 04:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.710 --> 04:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
um seeing none
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
i thank you so much uh for your request
 
04:26:28.149 --> 04:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for your testimony
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
the next
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:37.910 --> 04:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
you can unmute yourself
 
04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
and we'd love to hear what you have to
 
04:26:39.760 --> 04:26:48.710 align:start position:0%
and we'd love to hear what you have to
say

04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:48.720 --> 04:26:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
guess mr keane doesn't want to speak
 
04:26:53.670 --> 04:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:26:53.680 --> 04:26:54.550 align:start position:0%
right now
so

04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:57.110 --> 04:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
he just dropped maybe he'll come back
 
04:27:02.790 --> 04:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
so right now we have uh rebecca ross
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
with her hand up she'd like to testify i
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
believe rebecca
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
you're on good afternoon again madam
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee thank
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to provide
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
testimony today we appreciate the
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
conversation and work we've had with
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative matamilla and agree that
 
04:27:21.269 --> 04:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill for further work is
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
04:27:25.750 --> 04:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
approach at this time briefly i'd like
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
to explain that
 
04:27:29.590 --> 04:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
we had concerns that
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
removing the availability of the chins
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
program which we see as a service driven
 
04:27:37.110 --> 04:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
program rather than a punitive program
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
would have an unintended consequence of
 
04:27:43.670 --> 04:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
removing one of the doors to treatment
 
04:27:46.229 --> 04:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
and services available to
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
um minor victims of trafficking we think
 
04:27:50.950 --> 04:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
there are some other ways to approach
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
that besides closing the door completely
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
um and have agreed to work on that
 
04:27:58.630 --> 04:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
language and approach going forward so
 
04:27:58.640 --> 04:27:59.429 align:start position:0%
language and approach going forward so
we

04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
