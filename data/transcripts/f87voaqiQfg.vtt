00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
services I'm bringing forward this
 
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 align:start position:0%
legislation at the request of the New
 
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of special
 
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
education administrators and the New
 
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Alliance for public charter
 
00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
schools these are the two groups
 
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
involved in producing and implementing
 
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
memorandums of understanding between
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
public charter schools and local
 
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.309 align:start position:0%
public charter schools and local
education

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
agencies briefly uh charter schools are
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
public schools but run independently
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
generally exempt from many state laws
 
00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
that govern traditional Public Schools
 
00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 align:start position:0%
technically Charter Schools as all
 
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
public schools are required to admit
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities per fedal law
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
unlike other states New Hampshire is
 
00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
unique in that the school district in
 
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
which the student resides is responsible
 
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
for providing um uh free appropriate Ed
 
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
public education commonly known as a
 
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
fate um and that includes the
 
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
funding in including the funding and
 
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
required services to each child with a
 
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
disability including these children with
 
00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
individual education plans that a parent
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
has independently enrolled in the
 
00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
charter school to every child with a
 
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
disability there are four ways in which
 
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
this would
 
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
occur uh one is to uh send resident
 
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
School District staff to the Charter
 
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
School the second way is to contract
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
with the charter school for the Charter
 
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
School staff to provide the
 
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
services Third Way is to contract with a
 
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
vendor to provide services at or away
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
from the charter school and the fourth
 
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
um way you can do it is to provide
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
services in the Resident District's own
 
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.189 align:start position:0%
services in the Resident District's own
Public

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
Public
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
Schools a student's IEP is developed by
 
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
the resident district and details What
 
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
specifically designated instruction and
 
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
related Services the student will
 
00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
receive it is up to the local education
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
agencies and the charter schools to
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
determine how the services will be
 
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
delivered occasionally it can be a
 
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
challenge for school districts and
 
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools to come to an agreement
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
on all aspects of the IAP but for the
 
00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
most part these barriers are resolved by
 
00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.590 align:start position:0%
most part these barriers are resolved by
working

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
collaboratively once signed by the
 
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
parent the IE is the legal document that
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
commits the school district to provision
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
of services outlined in the I
 
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
AP it's important to note that in 2016
 
00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
there was a legislative commission
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
formed that was charged with identifying
 
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
challenges related to special education
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's public charter
 
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
schools and bringing forward
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations to improve this process
 
00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
ensuring that all students with I APS
 
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
are reserving the services that they
 
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
need uh one of these recommendations was
 
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
that uh the New Hampshire education
 
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
department require the leas and public
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
charter schools to formally detail how
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
students with IEPs will receive required
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
Services a law requiring M us was passed
 
00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:09.589 align:start position:0%
Services a law requiring M us was passed
in

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
2021 unfortunately rather than smooth
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
the path M us have created more work and
 
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
increased legal costs for both the
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
school districts and the charter
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
schools While most charter schools in
 
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
leas have been able to come to
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
agreements in completing the memorandums
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
of understanding many still remain
 
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
unsigned mind primarily due to financial
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
disagreements currently while M are
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
required by law there is no impass
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
resolution process so they're not
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
enforceable according to the Department
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
of Education there are currently 94 M us
 
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
that have not been signed for the 2024
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
25 school year and 16 of these were not
 
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
signed for two consecutive years in a
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
row since the LA since and Charter
 
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
School Personnel Personnel are spending
 
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
hours of time hammering out details and
 
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
incurring increased legal expenses they
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
are requesting the repeal of the
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
requirement both federal and state laws
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
require that school districts provide a
 
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
fape to all eligible students and data
 
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
supports that no school district has
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
refused to provide special education or
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
related services to any child attending
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
a public charter school
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
because the even because the memorandum
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
of understanding was not signed by both
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
parties so in other words if theou is
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
not signed uh students are still
 
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.749 align:start position:0%
not signed uh students are still
receiving

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
Services uh prior to the requirement
 
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 align:start position:0%
there are three special education
 
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
complaints filed related to the
 
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
provision of services at a charter
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
school so far this year that number is
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
the same so it seems that the existence
 
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
of the m has had little effect I hope
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
that you will support this legislation
 
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
to remove theou requirement to allow
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
both the charter school personnel and
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
District special Educators to focus

the request of both the special ed
 
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
administrators and the association of
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools so it seems they are in
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
agreement that this is the best way to
 
00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:38.990 align:start position:0%
agreement that this is the best way to
go

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
barriers that is kind of is had really
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
gotten in the way of
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
of educating students um what they found
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro County District 12 I am here
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
222 an act repealing the requirement for
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
a memorandum of understanding between a
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
chartered public school and School
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
District regarding how students with
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities will receive special
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
education services I do have written
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
testimony however there's a delay in my
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
getting copies so I'll have to wait on
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
everyone getting a copy but that's forth
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
coming every now and again a piece of
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
legislation strikes me as well-meaning
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
but entirely and completely
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
impractical the requirement of a
 
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding also known
 
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
mou comes from one of those pieces of
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
legislation and it must now be repealed
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
as a law when I first read the original
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
Bill where this mou came from which is
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%

to our schools our role is to improve

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
I will just touch upon the highlights
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
the first thing that I'd like to mention
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
is that our association uh works
 
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with Charter Schools we
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of charter
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
schools within New Hampshire and our
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
educational communities our organization
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh meets monthly with our Charter
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
Schools we have what we call a
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
collaborative work group we engage the
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in those work
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
groups uh the work groups are designed
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
for us to identify best practices and
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
build upon those and identify any
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
challenges and problem solve around them
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
um and we've been having this work group
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
for over two years now and meet on a
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
regular basis we've also designed um
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
some collaborative professional learning
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
opportunities together we have uh
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored with the Department of
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
Education and the alliance uh to uh
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
Charter School um conferences and we
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
will have another one um in in the
 
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.270 align:start position:0%
will have another one um in in the
summer

00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
um as already mentioned um as in idea
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
the IEP really is the legal binding
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
document that uh holds the district
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
accountable for everything that's in the
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
IEP theou is not uh legally required and
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
just adds another layer of paperwork uh
 
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
we have seen over the past two years um
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
that theou really has not had any
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
positive impact upon kids the The
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth that we serve serve
 
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
um their learning or the families um
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
that are engaged with um the children
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
with with IEPs as already mentioned in
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
2016 there was a legislative commission
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
formed to study uh special education and
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
charter schools there were many
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations brought forward in uh
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
that report the F the biggest one
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
centered around funding and when M us
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
are not being signed they typically are
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
around um disputes related to uh the
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
costs and fees uh related to special
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
education so funding still continues to
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
be um a significant issue um some of the
 
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
other bullets um that I have in in the
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
testimony um and again I'm not going to
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
go through all of them because some of
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
them have already been mentioned um but
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
this really has proven to be hours and
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
hours of time and legal fees both for
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
school districts um and our chartered
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
public school and we really feel as
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
though this time and effort should be
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the Children and Youth and
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
their families as well as um trying to
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
recruit people to work um in special ed
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
in our charter schools and our Public
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
Schools so if we could have that time
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
back and dedicate it more uh to have an
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
impact on on children and family we
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
would appreciate doing that um in
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
closing I would say that revoking this
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh requirement for anou would only
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
benefit all of us um it would uh give us
 
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for more time to work
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
with our Charter Schools um more time um
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
to recruit folks to work in our schools
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
um but it really hasn't been anything
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
that we would say is a benefit uh to any
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
of us so um thank you very much for your
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
consideration of Our Testimony and I
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
that you might have thank you questions
 
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.870 align:start position:0%
that you might have thank you questions
representative

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman good morning
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
good to see you again um and thank you
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
for your testimony as usual it's very
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
complete just a couple questions in in
 
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
context if I
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
recall a couple years back when this
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
first uh dialogue came about there was
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
the there was a problem regarding the
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
time frame particularly if I recall
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
correctly at the beginning of the year
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
that lag from when the youngsters came
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
in and the time the child school got up
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
and the public who it up and there's a
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's a time a gap there and I thought
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
that that Jan that this is one of the
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
intents of the all you would to try to
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
bring them back in a collegial way to
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
try to get those things worked up it
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
seems like what you're saying is we've
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
gone one step ahead and two steps
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
backwards thank you for the question and
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
to your point that is correct and you
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
know and we try to adjust the date of
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
when these were signed and and that
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
didn't help and you know we we don't
 
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
always know when kids enroll in in
 
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
charter schools this is a a parent
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
enrolling and especially with our kids
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
who are struggling um they don't often
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
times tell the charter school that my
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
student uh had an IEP and they don't
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
tell um the public school so it's really
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
no one's fault and and parents have the
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
right to disclose or not disclose um but
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
it it just we we do a lot of catchup and
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
by the time we realize that we've got a
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
struggling child um we then learn oh he
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
he did have an IEP so yeah we we do a
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
lot of catchup thank you thank you
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
sure sure any further
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
questions um just we had um just one
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
from me we had testimony earlier that
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
there were 95 94 unsigned um M us uh
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
currently I believe uh mainly due to
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
financial reasons um can you talk a
 
00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
little bit about the financial reasons
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
that have been holding up M
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
us yes I you know um um and I and I
 
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
think our Charter Schools can also
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
reinforce this um when school districts
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
and our our charter schools are writing
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
up the M us some are writing up
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
contracts in addition to the saus if in
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
fact uh a charter school is providing
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
the services um they can determine what
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
the fee for service is um and charge the
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
school district that and and there have
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
been some disputes around Fe for
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
service um who's determining that um if
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
if the charter school is Contracting
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
with someone to do that um not allowing
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
or making available the contract um with
 
00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
the independent organization to the Lea
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
as um evidence of what this service is
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
costing there have been disputes over
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
Individual Services and what to charge
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
versus small group group there have been
 
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
uh conflicts with differing prices with
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
differing districts not being consistent
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
um and again not this is not anyone's
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
fault but there are some
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies um and so sometimes that
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
that is the barrier does that help to
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
clarify thank you you're welcome maray
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
my question I did have one small
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
question about how it would be the case
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
that the public charter school would not
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
be aware that a child has an IEP um
 
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
aren't those files something you receive
 
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.710 align:start position:0%
aren't those files something you receive
upon

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
enrollments this is a parent enrolling
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
um their child and they don't have to
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
disclose that information our charter
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
schools accept all kids um and the
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
parents don't necessarily have to um
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
disclose that
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
information repres wood thanks um F and
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
represent Celli's question if I may to
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
provide Clarity because um I want to be
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
sure I have this right which I probably
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't um is the China school do the
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
China school have the ability to
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
contract uh prior to the approval of the
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
Lea I mean can they go I thought I
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
thought um that the first priority was
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
the Lea trying to provide the services
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
but can the child school as a prior to
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
that just say no we have it right here
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it the and then that's
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
is that part of that conflict or don't
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
they have that right that several of the
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
charter schools and again our Charter
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
School colleagues can speak more to this
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
but several of our Charter Schools do
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
have staff um employed um some of them
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
can't fill those positions so they're
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
Contracting um you know we we just for
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
from our perspective we just want to get
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
the services for kids okay no matter
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
what we have to do if the if the charter
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
has to contract if we have to pay the
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
charter schools if we we have to
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
contract um first and foremost we want
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
to get the services for kids so it can
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
happen in a variety of different ways
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%

we opened our doors 17 and a half years

Theus

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
Theus
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
um when the when the law was finalized
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I had resigned myself to doing doing
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
whatever it took to get Theus worked
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
through and signed I was not looking
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
forward to it and um I made the
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
assumption that the special Educators in
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
the state had needed this even though in
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
17 and a half years we did not need it
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
we were always able to work it out and
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
sign contracts with the districts if we
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
were providing in
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
Services when I joined the collaborative
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
work group with the New Hampshire
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
Association of special ed
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
administrators I was surprised to learn
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
that they too were very frustrated with
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
theou so we all agreed that we
 
00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:51.310 align:start position:0%
theou so we all agreed that we
would

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.430 align:start position:0%
would
request

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
um look for a sponsor for the bill to
 
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.710 align:start position:0%
um look for a sponsor for the bill to
um

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
RSA I am
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
aware of no Charter
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
School whose
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
students well all charter school
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
students are receiving Services um for
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
the most part and any who are not it is
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
not due to to anou being unsigned so
 
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
there are no services not being provided
 
00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
signed we
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
have this year over 70 students in our
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
school with IEPs and that's a fairly
 
00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:45.950 align:start position:0%
school with IEPs and that's a fairly
typical

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
typical
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
number we work with over 15
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
districts and we as I said have always
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
been able to come to an agreement the
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
first year that Theus were required
 
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
during the summer I spent at least 80
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
hours working with our different school
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
districts reviewing Theus sending them
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
to our lawyer proposing alternative
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
language all while we were trying to get
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
the school open it was exhausting it's
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
not like I stopped doing the other
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
things I just had to stay up later to
 
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
try to get them all done we also spent
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
several thousand in legal fees that
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
year the second year which was this past
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
year I would estimate that we spent I
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
spent over 50
 
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
hours on this because some of our
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
districts just kept the
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
same as the previous year but I still
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
had to review all of them to see if
 
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
there were any changes from the previous
 
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
year and when there were or if there
 
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.549 align:start position:0%
year and when there were or if there
were

00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
discussions run the um changes by our
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
Theus have a there's a template for
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
theou that nhed developed um a lot of
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
the districts don't use it and so there
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
are different M out there as I said
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
earlier we have not needed to do this it
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
created conflict it created unnecessary
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
time spent in a very full schedule
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
working with children with iups I should
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
say too that
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I have been a special educator for 35
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
years and so I've got a lot of
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
experience with working through iups and
 
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
helping children um with disabilities
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
and only want the best for them so I
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
certainly would not testify in favor of
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
this repal if I felt like it would hurt
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
them thank you thank you

bill excuse me the department proposed
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
theou for charter schools in the 2022
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
legislative session as there was no
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
oversight for the provision of special
 
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
education within charter schools at the
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
time it was reported To Us by both
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
charter schools and districts that they
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
had students that at times were not
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
getting their services on time as the
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
two entities could not come to an
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
agreement about how the student was
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
going to receive Services we worked with
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
both charter schools and districts to
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
develop the mou based on the concerns
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
expressed before the legislation and
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
from that work group with the input of
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner we put forth the
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
current template for the mou since the
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
implementation of the mou we have heard
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
that it is cumbersome and difficult to
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
do one or both parties are unclear on
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
how they should be using theou as well
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
as concerns with there being no support
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
if one party or both parties are not
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
willing to develop anou this then leads
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
concerns that there is no recourse for
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
either party if they cannot come to an
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
agreement we also have had concerns
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
regarding the fees charged to schools
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
for services and there is no
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
documentation to support the changes to
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
districts and several districts are
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
charged full price for a service when it
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
could actually be split between several
 
00:33:27.159 --> 00:33:28.470 align:start position:0%
could actually be split between several
districts

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
while we understand the concerns with
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
theou we would express our concerns with
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
going back to no oversight of special
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
education in charter schools they do not
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
have approved programs as traditional
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
Public Schools publicy or the JMA and
 
00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
the private providers are required to
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
have they are only considered a regular
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
education environment yet many of them
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
have special education teachers and
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
provide services without an approval
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
from the Department there is no process
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
to support Charters and districts if
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
there is disagreement regarding the
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
provision of special education services
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
and there are no guidelines as to how
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
Services contracted by charter school
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
should be paid by the districts as you
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
consider this legislation to Mo remove
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
theou we ask that you consider any or
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
all of the items listed above about the
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
oversight of special education in
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
charter schools I'm happy to take any
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning I see you every
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
day here I should just move in um thank
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
you for coming in I uh as you said I
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
think in your context in your dialogue I
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
didn't read that I was listening to you
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's exactly that um the department
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
initiated the the idea yes uh of the m
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
to try to help the uh difficulty with
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
the transition and oversight
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
yep so if if I'm wrong stop here so I'm
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
thinking as we've heard other testimony
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
that it hasn't worked and that was sort
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
of became more of an obstacle than an
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
assistance I guess my question is during
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
that you and I'm thinking I'm hearing
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
you say it's it should still be
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
maintained you didn't say you support it
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
but you didn't say you didn't take a
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
position of it it seemed that you
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
thought there still was a need for that
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
type of oversight but my question is if
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
you if over the last two years we saw
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
all these problems or the school
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
districts and leas and the child who saw
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
all this obviously they must have
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
because there's a bill here they're
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
talking about it did did your department
 
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
ever step in and help out so we have
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
tried to help out with as much Authority
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
that we have but we can't order either
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
of them to do something there's no um
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
there's no provision within the law for
 
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
us to say You must do or you have to do
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
or you so that so we did help as much as
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
we could but we don't have any re
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse if they can't come
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
to an agreement there's no um appeal
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
process there's nobody I can send them
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
to um so so that was part of the issue
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
was that there we don't have any
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
authority to do that okay so and and I'm
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
not and we're not opposed or supporting
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if we take this away
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
then there's nothing that would that
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
would help us with special education in
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
the charter schools I know that it's a
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's a problem I know that it's
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
cumbersome I know that it takes a lot of
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
time but this is this is all we have so
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative welcome uh back to
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
education again thank you Mr education
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
policy I should say right we live and
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
breathe education yes thank you for
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question excuse
 
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
taking my question excuse
me

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
so the first part is does the current
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
special education audit include auditing
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
charter school special education
 
00:36:32.349 --> 00:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
services no because there's no we have
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
no authority to monitor Charter Schools
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
or go into charter schools so there's
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing um that we do with
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools currently besides
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
theou followup or second question really
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
yeah given what you said a moment ago in
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
response to representative
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
Woodcock does the department have
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations of other ways
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
to address the concern of challenges
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
between Charters and school districts
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
since the consensus both here so far and
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
online is in support of removing theou
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
is there something that would be better
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
I think that that's uh a conversation
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
that I think it's a good question thank
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for the question um I
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
think it's a good question um and and it
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
goes I would go back to that it charter
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
schools are not we do not approve
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
charter schools and they we do not have
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
any oversight of them so that the the
 
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
reason we did theou was to provide some
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
oversight if we were to repeal that I
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
would ask that we consider something
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
else every other school has to have any
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
resource room or self-contained
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
classroom approved through my office um
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
we have to go out we have to see the
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
classroom we have to make sure that
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're certified teachers that's not
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
the case for for Charter Schools um so I
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of different things
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
that we could look at if if this is what
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
you were going to repeal I'm just
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
concerned that if you take this there is
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else there's I have no
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
recourse for anything if there's no I
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
don't even have recourse with theou to
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
be honest but there's nothing um nothing
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
education um would would I heard um
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
testimony about a OU template yes um was
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
that something I didn't catch was that
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
something the department came up with or
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
Y as part of the legislation um it said
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
that we needed to develop a template so
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
we worked with um both the assoc the um
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
St School administrators Association and
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
the charter organization to develop
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
theou and then um our commissioner
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
reviewed it in the end and then it was
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
submitted to the districts as a template
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
for them to use but it was not in the
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
legislation it was not required right
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to get a copy of
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
yes um further
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.069 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
thank

00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%

00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
special education definitions and the
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is here with
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
assistance um uh representative katab

please introduce the
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you chairman cordelli and
 
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
members of the House Education
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
committee House Bill 699 was entered at
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
the request of the NHD following a
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
special education audit to ensure
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
Federal compliance and the two biggest
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
things that this bill aims to do is one
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that children are receiving
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
specialized instructions such as reading
 
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
from qualified reading Specialists
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
rather than parent
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
Educators as required under the Ida and
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
two to add a definition of educational
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
environment to clarify that approval
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
from the bureau is required for such
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
environments which is aiming to prevent
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
children from being placed in unapproved
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
or inappropriate environments such as
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
store storage closets or boiler rooms
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
and yes unfortunately this has happened
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that this does
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
not happen again unfortunately there's
 
00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:07.799 align:start position:0%
been a rapid spread of of misinformation
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
about the bill which has caused much
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
concern to
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
parents regarding their children's
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
services and thinking that they're going
 
00:49:17.549 --> 00:49:17.559 align:start position:0%
to be effective I want to address the
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
points that have been brought to my
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
attention and provide accurate
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
information and hopefully alleviate the
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about the impact on children's
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
services one
 
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.230 align:start position:0%
services one
the

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
definition um of related Services being
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated is not taking away related
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
services from children it's simply
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
removing an unnecessary and incomplete
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
definition in Ed rules we default to
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
this the federal definition as it's
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
really well defined a nearly three-page
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
definition for that one definition this
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
definition takes the beginning of that
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
definition and leaves so many needed
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
and I want to again specify that this is
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
not taking away any related Services it
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
is removing the definition it is not
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
removing related services from the rest
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the statute nor from from children's
 
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
IEPs it wouldn't be compliant with idea
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
to do so furthermore it is not
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
redefining educational environment that
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
that was never previously
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
defined it's not it's not at all
 
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
intended to mandate the special
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
education service be exclusively
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
provided outside of the general
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
education setting the least restrictive
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
environment principle still applies and
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
decisions will still be made by the
 
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.950 align:start position:0%
decisions will still be made by the
educational

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
educational
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
team um this bill is clarifying that the
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
bureau retains The Authority for
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
approval so that we ensure that these
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
environments are appropriate I have put
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
in an amendment to clarify that
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
educational environment is special
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
educational environment so that when
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
2- a instead of saying educational
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
environment it'll say special
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
educational environment and then further
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
down where it's saying where Services
 
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:12.799 align:start position:0%
can be provided it it still says in any
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
educational environment as determined by
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
the IEP team so we're not at all
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
mandating that they can only be there I
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
also want to clarify that we are not
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
taking away services for the
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
functionally blind it's eliminating an
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessary definition without affecting
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
eligibility for these Services just as
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
we don't Define death autism Etc this
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
definition isn't needed there's an
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
entire statute on the education of the
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
blind in
 
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
186b so again we're just trying to clean
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
up some of these definitions we are not
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
taking away any services from children
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
and I do think that the bill is very
 
00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
important because I do think we need to
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have our children
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
educated in appropriate environments and
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
not inside of boiler rooms and that our
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
children are receiving their related
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
Services by appropriate and qualified
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
Personnel not parent Educators I'm happy
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
to take any questions on this Bill thank
 
00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:11.799 align:start position:0%
you questions yes represent
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%

this bill so I just for
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
clarification this bill does not take
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
any transportation Support Services
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
placement in a residential facility a
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
medical IAL Services away from children
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
in need is that correct that is correct
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
it absolutely does not take any of those
 
00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
Services away thank
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
you represent W talk thank you CH good
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for being here um I
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear you said that this
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
bill came from a result of the audit
 
00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:50.839 align:start position:0%
okay um in crafting the the intent of
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
the bill removing definitions changing
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
that and I understand what you're saying
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
about not taking away any related
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
services but intent of refining the
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
definition of those things who did that
 
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.190 align:start position:0%
definition of those things who did that
come

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
from it came from Miss fette oh came
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
you um I just wanted be clear um related
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
Services uh
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
Roman um five I guess on page
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
two that is covered under Federal Ida
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
law and there's no change there so we
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
are bound by federal law in that regard
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
correct that's absolutely correct our
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
definition was the beginning copy and
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
paste of the federal definition but
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
because the definition is three pages
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
long it removed a lot of the needed
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
definition in there and we don't want
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
anybody to think that they don't need to
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
provide the rest of that so it's we need
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
to default to the federal statute in its
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
entirety which is what it does in Ed
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
rules thank you and I did put together
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
um an amendment just to clarify a couple
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
of the words it just came in so
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they haven't had a chance
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
to print it yet but I will get that over
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
to you thank
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Bon uh thank you
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious why remove it
 
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
in its entirely as a definition and why
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
not just put it in as and reference the
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
federal um citation because it does
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
appear that it's being taken out for you
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
know just just by looking at it um so
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
would a reference
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
help thank you for the question so I'd
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
be happy to do that but there's a lot of
 
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
other words in here that we don't Define
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
that we do default to the federal
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
statutes and so I think when you start
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
getting into that we would have a lot of
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
definitions where we're saying refer to
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
the federal statute it does say in it
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
does say within the document that we
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
need to make add rules that
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
the statute and within the Ed rules it
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
does explicitly say related Services
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
means related Services as in CFR and it
 
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
gives the exact reference to the federal
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
definition so I think we would just get
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
to a repetitive point if we did that for
 
00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:12.069 align:start position:0%
to a repetitive point if we did that for
every

00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
single piece within the within all
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
within our statutes it would just be
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
very lengthy potentially I'll followup
 
00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:22.839 align:start position:0%
yes um I'm just uh referring to a
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
conversation uh from Miss Benton that
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
was very specific about if if we don't
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
have something that points directly to
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
legislative statute and that's where the
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
rules Come From so that's my concern is
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
that that she was very specific in
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
statute um I know that Miss Fenton will
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
be here this morning and also miss fette
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
said that um she she might be able to
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
answer that better if the committee
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
feels like that is the best way to go
 
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
and if the attorney agrees that that's
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
the right way to do it I'm
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
definitely happy with that resolution I
 
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
do not want anybody
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
to be anxious or have a misunderstanding
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
that their children's services are being
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
taken away I would never ever support
 
00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
such a
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you yes representative Damon
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
my question and simple could you just
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
repeat what you said about adding the
 
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.190 align:start position:0%
repeat what you said about adding the
word

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
special into education environment and
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
tell me what lines that was on and I
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
think it was two places
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so it'll be um 186
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
C2 um mean what lines in the bill I
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
think it's line seven on page two page
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
two line
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
seven thank and was that the only place
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thought there were true well that
 
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:46.039 align:start position:0%
right there and then within it it also
 
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
says I'm sorry let me grab a copy of the
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
also on line 10 where it says
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
educational environments it'll now say
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%

much thank you for clarifying things for
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
um hello full disclosure I'm a mom and
 
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
I've never done this before and it is
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
intimidating um but I'm also uh confused
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
because I prepared my remarks in advance
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
based on believing that my children were
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
going to be losing a lot of things that
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
they deserve and benefit from
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
so do I tell you my position on that or
 
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.390 align:start position:0%
so do I tell you my position on that or
or

00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
not um okay briefly you could you know
 
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
concern my name is Amy wheeler teas I
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
live in ashwa if I could if you have
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
up to the when you finish okay
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'm the proud mother of three
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
children I vehemently oppose House Bill
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
699 on the base of egregious
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination and moral corruption I am
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully pleading that each and
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
every one of you oppose this bill and
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
here is
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
why two of my children were born with a
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
rare genetic disorder called SoDo
 
00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:41.799 align:start position:0%
syndrome their SoDo Syndrome causes
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
physical and cognitive disabilities but
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%

classrooms in order to overcome their
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
physical and cognitive challenges they
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
utilize supportive Education Service
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
such as occupational speech and vision
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%

00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
and so much
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
more attend in the classroom with needed
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
assistance allows them to reach their

full potential removing them from the

classroom or stripping them of needed
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
Services would be debilitating just as
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
importantly the entire student body and
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
school Community would suffer great
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
consequences by their absence my
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
children with SoDo syndrome are not less
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
than they are Whole Body and Soul
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
Children that deserve every ounce of
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity that any child
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
deserves I find this bill abhorent
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
ignorant and hateful I have been a proud
 
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
Granite stator for my entire life and I
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
assure you that this is New Hampshire
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
can do better than this we were the
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
first state in the nation to integrate
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
our disabled students in their Hometown
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
Public Schools back in
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
1991 I know this because I am a better
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
person today for having been a student
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the town of amers during the 19 90s
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
we are not a state that is going to
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
segregate and
 
01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
exclude I find it despicable that
 
01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
elected officials in our state are
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
trying to dismantle our public education
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
despite the majority of constituents
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
such as myself not being in
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
favor legislation like this furthers the
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
segregation it puts a Target on children
 
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and it also puts a
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
Target on children who utilize our
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
you questions see none thank you very
 
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
much for being here oh represent Freeman
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you so much for coming
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
um your your letter was very hotf and I
 
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that given what you heard
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
from the prime sponsor of the bill do
 
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
you feel a little bit better knowing
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
that that's not what the intent of this
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
for I do if I know that that's being
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
held but but as a citizen who's not
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
participated in this forum before I
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
don't trust 100% that just because
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
someone said it and it's on record how
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
do I know that after everyone approves
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
it that they don't go turn around and do
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what I just said I'm afraid
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to do so I I need to
 
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
understand in a general sense how that
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
is truly something I can count
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
onk if if I could just speak I guess for
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
myself um we have dealt with special ed
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
services since I've been in the
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
legislature starting in
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
2012 and I think we have always um as a
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
a legislative body um tried to work for
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
better services for those children with
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities and I don't think that that
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
will change anytime in the near future
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
well I appreciate that but one thing
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
that I am still a little concerned about
 
01:02:59.069 --> 01:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
is this term of of an appropriate
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
special education uh environment um and
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
I cannot stress to you enough and I am
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
the living proof of it I went to Sagan
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
High School from '92 to 96 and I had two
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
um former lonia State institution
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
students who went to school with me for
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
those four years and it made a damn big
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
difference to me and my classmates and I
 
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
cannot iness stress enough that my
 
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
children Frankie and Magdalena to be in
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
the general education environment as
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
much as possible yes there are times
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
they need to be pulled out for certain
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
instruction but so help me God I do not
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
want to see that the definition of a
 
01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
special education environment means they
 
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
are secluded in some sort of classroom
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of some wing and they are
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
never integrated with with peers who do
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
not have the same
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities where's my insurance on
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
that if I'll just read from the
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just got this this
 
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
moment um special education environment
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
replaces what's in the bill this is uh
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the amendment special education
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
environment means a special education
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
setting that has received approval from
 
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
the bureau this environment is managed
 
01:04:16.109 --> 01:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
by the school district and serves
 
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities as specified
 
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
in their individual education program
 
01:04:22.829 --> 01:04:22.839 align:start position:0%
when they are removed from their general
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
education setting special education
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
environments are resource rooms
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
self-contained classrooms and early
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
childhood special education programs
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
okay so that's my concern doesn't say
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
general education
 
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
classrooms my they my children should
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
not be locked away in a special
 
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:40.839 align:start position:0%
education resource room for the entire
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
school day they need it for certain
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
services and they thrive in their
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
regular classroom and so do the students
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
around them who are learning to
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
understand that some kids have a
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
communication difference some kids might
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
have a physical difference where my son
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
needs to stem and clap there's a lot of
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
things that the other kids are learning
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
about how Frankie and magdalina are
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
equal they they are not freaks of nature
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
and they're not um to be to be cast
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
aside in some room so I guess I am still
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this okay thank you
 
01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:13.710 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this okay thank you
very

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.390 align:start position:0%
very
much

01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Hall thank you Mr
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
question um part of this bill when it
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
was introduced it said it was to make
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the student said specialized
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
instruction and not to be dealt with
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
Paras or whatever has that been a
 
01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
concern of yours with your
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
children um it is I think that the
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
amount of instruction that are being
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
left to the Paras is very unfair to the
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
Paras um we've had some very good Paras
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
with my children that I love and respect
 
01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
and they go above and beyond for my kids
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
but they really are not being um paid
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
for that job um so
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh at least I I can only speak for naswa
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
and in naswa I am quite vocal about um
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
the need for par of support to be
 
01:06:11.119 --> 01:06:12.950 align:start position:0%
the need for par of support to be
increased

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
increased
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
greatly thank you representative
 
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you so
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
much for being here and um moving past
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
the feeling that we're intimidating we
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
be I would encourage you to continue to
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
be attentive and
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
visible with respect to my colleague we
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
have worked hard in the legislature to
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
support special education services and
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
quite frankly everything is vulnerable
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
to Dollars and
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman cordelli and the
 
01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:35.799 align:start position:0%
committee um as representative kutab
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
said we had requested this language as
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
we were um through our audits we were
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
asked to look at our laws and rules to
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
ensure they're accurate and aligned with
 
01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
Federal language I'm going to go through
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
the changes for you one by one and I'll
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
talk about program approval and
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
educational environments at the end
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
because it is the Hot Topic um if you
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
look on your paper on page two line 17
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
we corre Ed the language in the
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
definition of speal special education to
 
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
align with the federal language that
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
specifies that it is specially designed
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
instruction not instruction specifically
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
designed on page two starting on line 19
 
01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
we took out section five as it is
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
verbatim the federal language in 34 CFR
 
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
3.34 related to related services and as
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative kutab said it is a much
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
shortened version um so this would this
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
steers us back to that Federal language
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
this does not mean that we are removing
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
related Services we are removing the

exact definition partial definition
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
students will still have the same rights

and protections of the federal law in

regards to related
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
services on page two line 35 we took out
 
01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
the definition of functionally blind as
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
this meets the parameters of the
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
definition of legally blind and is
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
included in the federal definition for
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
Blind and Visually Impaired functionally
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%

state language or federal language this
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
was all following under the definition

of Blind and Visually Impaired on page
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
three line 8 we Define specially
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
designed instruction as there is
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
continually misunderstanding of what
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
should it look like in schools we are
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
ensuring we are meeting federal law by
 
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
clarifying who can provide specially
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
designed instruction and what it would
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
look like in practice this is where we
 
01:09:16.269 --> 01:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
said that it's a certified teacher this
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
is required by Ida that they be
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
certified on page three line 19 we added
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
the definition of our special education
 
01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:26.679 align:start position:0%

01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
rules the word program is used in
 
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
several different types of approval for
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
districts and their needs needed to be
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
clarification of what each of these
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
types of approval are currently program
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
approval encompasses all district
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
special education programs all private
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
approvals all individual program
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
approvals as well as the approval of
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
self-contained classrooms and resource
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
rooms within districts publicy and the
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
JMA the approval of resource rooms and
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
self-contained classrooms is a very
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
different process than the other
 
01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
approvals and we wanted to clarify the
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
difference between the two these two
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
environments are on the Continuum of
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
environments for students there will be
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
no change in how we monitor either the
 
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
programs or the educational environments
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
however it will provide Clarity in
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
working with districts and Reporting on
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
the different approvals to the public
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
this does not remove all the other
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
educational environments such as regular
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
classroom Hospital homebound separate
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
School residential it does not remove
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
any of those it merely clarifies that
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
for these two educational programs we
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
need to provide them with
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
approval that is all it does it does not
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
take anything else away it says that for
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
those two we are going to provide
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
approval which we are required to do per
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
our laws and rules none of the changes
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
we are proposing will remove anyone's
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
rights under and state regulation All
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
rights are still intact for students
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
with disabilities I would like to refer
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
back to representative balon's question
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
for special education we build off of
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
Ida ID Ida is the foundation of what we
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
follow and then state law expands on Ida
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
so we always have to go back to Ida we
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
have been we do not reference it
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
repeatedly because it is our
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
foundational law so if we have Ida we
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
always go back to that and then anything
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
else that we put into law is ex excess
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
so related Services is defined in Ida it
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
will stay the same it's just taking up
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
that partial definition that had been
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
there before and thank you I'll take any
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
questions you may
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
have yes represent thank you Mr chair
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss f for the
 
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
clarification I just had a question um
 
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker raised a concern
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
about children with special needs not
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
being um integrated into general
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
education settings I'm looking at the
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that was just passed around
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
and on line 16 it mentions general
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
education settings so am I correct in
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
reading this bill that inter creation
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
would still be the cing practice yes it
 
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
would be um it's we don't have to
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
approve a regular education en
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
environment we don't have to approve a
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
hospital homebound um but we do have to
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
approve a resource room and a
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
self-contained classroom to ensure that
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
they have the correct Staffing that they
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
have the correct student to teach your
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
ratio um so and then it helps us to
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
track how much that student is pulled
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
out of the classroom so
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
this is just talking about those two
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
because I don't have to approve a
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
regular education environment that's
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you you're
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
welcome VOR Woodcock thank you chair
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
good morning yet again good morning in
 
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
terms of the line eight uh on the
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
amendment or the original no on the
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
regular on page three please okay uh I I
 
01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:49.870 align:start position:0%
regular on page three please okay uh I I
and

01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I understand reference back to the
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
federal statute but it very clear
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
initiates it says on on a it talks it
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
has to be provided by a special
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
education uh instructor teacher
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
certified teacher my concern is the uh
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
definition of related service
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
provider um what is their requirement
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
for if again mean where it say or
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
related service provider I'm concerned
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
that perhaps those people or that person
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
how how how is that Define so we know
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
that they are also certified not just a
 
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
a a contract Service that may not be
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
sure so so um all of those Services
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
require licensing most of that is done
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
through the oplc um and so a speech
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
pathologist any of those have to be
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
licensed they have to be certified in
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
the area that they are providing those
 
01:13:38.189 --> 01:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
Services um I mean you could put in
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
there that they're approved or licensed
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
or something like that but it's implied
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
that if you are a related service
 
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
provider you have your license to be
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
able to practice in New Hampshire and
 
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
provide those
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
Services follow yeah just just thank you
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
just so that that category related
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
service providers is referencing then
 
01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
those AR therapy people look okay that
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a uh a contract
 
01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
Service on the outside that has
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily bypassing
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
special well just to clarify it could be
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
a contracted service but it could be a
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
certified speech pathologist that's
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
providing that service so it it could be
 
01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
staff within the bill but either way
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
they have to be certified in licensed
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
they can't just okay thank you thank you
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair resident Murray thank you Mr
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
chairing thanks for taking my question
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the amendment which is
 
01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.950 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the amendment which is
2025

01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
2025
 
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
28h on lines 30 and 31 um it says um
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
about closely monitoring to make sure
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
that each student is making progress and
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
mastering their goals is there I'm I'm
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
curious to know whether or not the
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
Mastery of a goal is something that yes
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
that is obviously a goal but sometimes
 
01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
those are in progress in the
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
learning process so are we um to say
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
that something has to be mastered at
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
that moment I I I'm curious about why
 
01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
that moment I I I'm curious about why
that

01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
is we do while they may not master their
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
goal immediately from that time we would
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
hope that at some point they will master
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
that goal that it's not just a a goal
 
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
that you put in there and and there's no
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
progress and there's no Mastery so while
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
they may not master it the first time
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
that you put it in the next time they
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
may so it's it all depends on the child
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
all depends on the um the goal that
 
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
you're working towards
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
follow thank you I guess my question
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
would be is it making progress toward
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
mastering and mastering the goal you
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
could you could word it that way yes y
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bon uh thank you Mr
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for uh taking my
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
question so I I recall in the audit and
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
one of the big biggest criticism was the
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
um mismatch of definitions and and um
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes the state definitions exceeded
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
what the federal uh Law requires but I
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
am curious I I understand not wanting to
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
have the citations all throughout the
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
bill but um this one specially design
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
instruction actually does have the
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
citation from the I um from the ID I
 
01:16:12.629 --> 01:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
because it's it's we are adding on this
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
is where we're adding on to the
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
definition so we added this these a
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
through e are not part of the federal
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
definition we've added them on to
 
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
provide clarification to the
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
field so there's the base defition
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
definition um on 34 CFR 3.39 that's the
 
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
base definition of specially designed
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
instruction and then we've added on this
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
language to more clearly Define what
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
like um yeah so again I'll go back to
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
the one of the main criticisms in the
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
audit was um putting on why do we feel
 
01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
the need to put on additional
 
01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
requirements to what's already in the
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
idea because what that was one of the
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
criticisms is that um
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's getting more specific than needed
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
to be and this so on this case I think
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we needed to be more specific
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
because there are many times that um par
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
professionals or par educators are
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
providing specially designed instruction
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
and that is not allowed under idea um
 
01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
specially designed instruction needs to
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
be provided by a certified educator or a
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
related service provider who is licensed
 
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
as we discussed SOC it because it was
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
not it
 
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
were while it is additional to it's
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
while it's additional to what's in the
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
definition for specially designed
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
instruction it's clarifying language
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
that is in
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
Ida Mr chair just again just it is
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
relevant to um so what I'm so is this a
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
problem that's been identified in some
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
kind of an audit I don't recall reading
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
this specific issue being identified in
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
the audit so I'm just wondering what's
 
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
the origin why are we doing it so we are
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
currently under another audit the
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
special education audit and they are in
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
in mid process but we do receive from
 
01:17:59.310 --> 01:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
them um unofficial observations of
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
things that are that we need to work on
 
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
um at the same time when we do our
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
approvals of resource rooms and
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
self-contained classrooms and we're
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring we have found that par
 
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
professionals are providing specially
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
designed instruction and so we felt we
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
needed to clarify very clearly that that
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
is not what should be um
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
happening let me just clarify also that
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
there was an audit last year which was
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
related to due process and there was
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
another audit on more General special
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
education um issues uh specifically um
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
department um that is ongoing now
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
currently yes R
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
question also um with regard to the
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
underlying bill on page I guess it would
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
be one uh on lines 24 through 27 um
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
you're you're referencing acquired brain
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
y but you're only speaking to acquired
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
brain injury after birth not potentially
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
during the birthing process does that
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate a group of individuals who
 
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
might already qualify because of a an
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
injury during the birthing process so
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
the acquired brain injury is a
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
definition that was within our rules but
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
we've we moved it here to law um and
 
01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
that's I did not come up with that
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
definition we just felt that it needed
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
to be in law because it is specific to
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I would have to receive
 
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
technical assistance on whether we would
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
change this bill cuz we really just
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
moved it so that it would be part of
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
part of law okay I'll just mention that
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
um I did receive note from the Brain
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
Injury Association that they have um an
 
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
amendment coming a draft Amendment
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
section repres Paul thank you Mr chair
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
on the related Services let's say if a
 
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:49.719 align:start position:0%
school district has support Personnel
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
under speech and language when they go
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
in and they do the Direct Services are
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
they related service provider yes even
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
though they're not certified they're not
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
no they have to be
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
certified through through their process
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
of being a speech language pathologist a
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
physical therapist a physical therapy
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
assistant they are all licensed through
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
the oplc the office of professional
 
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
licenser so they're all licensed they
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
have to be in order to provide those
 
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
Services follow
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
up follow
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
up so you're saying
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
the I'm pretty sure that like support
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
Personnel so you've got you're yes I
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
understand the speech and language
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
person is certified but the F those
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
folks working under them that are not
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
certified they are not part of this so
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
par Educators par par Educators par
 
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
professionals is that what you're
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
referring to yes so there's so you would
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
have certified Educators which would be
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
your teachers your reading Specialists
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
um your interventionists all of them
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
would be certified teachers you have
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
your related Services which are your OT
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy Physical Therapy
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
speech and language and then you would
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
have um your PA of professionals or pair
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
Educators who Provide support to those
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
students directly L they may be
 
01:20:57.149 --> 01:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
certified because we do provide a
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
certification through our department but
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
they but that does not give them the
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
ability to teach or be a special
 
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
education teacher so they would not be
 
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
able to provide specially designed
 
01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.470 align:start position:0%
able to provide specially designed
instruction

01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative Woodcock Thank you
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
new chair thank you um I I have two
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions one I was going to ask
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli and I don't want to
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
put their new chair on the they ask you
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
but so if I may I just have two first
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
one is I want to follow up on
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's comment
 
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
um unless something has changed in the
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
classrooms I've seen over the last 10
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
years since I've been sitting here and
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
visiting there are circumstances when we
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
have special related C certified people
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
like reading particularly um or speech
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
who are overseeing the par professional
 
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
in the classroom but it's actually when
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
you go to that classroom often that
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
professional is in another classroom
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
there the par providing services are you
 
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
saying that's not happening so the par
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
profession may be Pro May a PA of
 
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
professional is there to reinforce or
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
retach the skills that have already been
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
taught by either the teacher or the
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
related service provider they should not
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
be teaching the skill implicitly so if
 
01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:07.719 align:start position:0%
the speech pathologist worked on a skill
 
01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:09.639 align:start position:0%
with the student and then they oversaw
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
the PA professional to reinforce that
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
same skill within the classroom or or
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
retach that that skill to the student as
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
they were in the classroom so that they
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
could carry that skill over into the
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
typical classroom okay may I fall up
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
with the one I was going to do for you
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um just fall I was going to go
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
through the chair but since you're
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
sitting there with you're in audit
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
number three or the this where this came
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
from but the first two audits that can
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
have come down or the special education
 
01:22:37.229 --> 01:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
audit can you tell me where we are in
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
terms of response public response to
 
01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
that uh documents of legislation so I
 
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
only know of two audits um so the the
 
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
first one that was completed was the
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
special education dispute resolution
 
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
audit um that was finalized and it does
 
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
not run through my office it runs
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
through the office of governance with um
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
attorney fent
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
however I believe she had said they
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
submitted their last report on that at
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
the last fiscal meeting so I believe
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
that one is done um our audit which is
 
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
special education um is not slated to be
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
done until the end of the year possibly
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
beginning of the new year okay thank you
 
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.950 align:start position:0%
beginning of the new year okay thank you
chair

01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:23:14.669 --> 01:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
sure representative McDonald thank you
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you again in
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
taking a second look at this amendment
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at Roman numero 5 and it has
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
a b CDE e and there's no F but the bill
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
has a provision f is that left off as
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
like an oversight or is there a reason
 
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't mentioned oh no we
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
removed it intentionally sorry all right
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
and is there a reason for that um we had
 
01:23:41.709 --> 01:23:41.719 align:start position:0%
it was um it was yeah um we had had
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
heard concerns about it and the way it
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
was worded there was no other it we just
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
did not feel it was appropriate to leave
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
it there once we heard the concerns
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
about it okay thank you I can give you a
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
long convoluted story but that's a short
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
word okay sure
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.239 --> 01:24:22.070 align:start position:0%

01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid this is only the second time
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
I've ever testified before a committee
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm unaware whether there's a
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%

but I am before you today in only my
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
capacities as a mother to a child with

benefit of support services and a
conquered

01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer as I sat down to write out what
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
to say to this Committee in opposition
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
to this bill I found that for the most
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
part I was too angry too frustrated too
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed to be either rational or
 
01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.350 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed to be either rational or
polite

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
polite
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
my first thoughts were an internal
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
dialogue laced with colorful expletives
 
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
I felt too angry to even know where to
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
begin as I sat down to type however my
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
more logical mind surfaced and I was
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
assessment having heard what the sponsor
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill said this morning some of
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
what I have prepared to say is is not
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
really relevant because
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
the intent was not to strip these
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
Services stripping these Services is
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely a violation of the idea it's
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
a violation of the Federal Regulations
 
01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
it's a violation of our state law it's a
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
violation of our state
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
regulations so a lot of what I did was I
 
01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
went through and I found all of the
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
citations and everywhere that it
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
modified off of where it was supposed to
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
be going um but if that's not the intent
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
of this bill then all of that all of
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
most of my prepared statement is
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
irrelevant but what I would like to say
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
to this committee is that if this bill
 
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
was an attempt to clarify it absolutely
 
01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:06.590 align:start position:0%
was an attempt to clarify it absolutely
positively

01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
positively
 
01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
fails there was not clarification here
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
witness all the people all the parents
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
all the family members of people with
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
special education kids who came out or
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
are coming out and are waiting behind me
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
to testify about how this bill can't be
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to pass and strip the services
 
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
from our kids if that wasn't the intent
 
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill then it sure as heck didn't
 
01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.030 align:start position:0%
of the bill then it sure as heck didn't
clarify

01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
anything the grammar I'm a I'm a policy
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
wonk or was when I was on the school
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
board I worked at one time for DHHS
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
helping to write policy uh worked with
 
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
some Jael car really good Jael car folks
 
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
drafted policies this I'm sorry all due
 
01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
respect stinks there are compound
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
sentences that you can't decide whether
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
you're making a list or whether it's a
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
run-on sentence with a dangling phrase
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
at the end you can't parse this bill
 
01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
into figuring out what it's supposed to
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
say quite to the contrary I would
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
suggest that this bill when it has a
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
definition from the federal law just say
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
the definition of special education or
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
the definition of related Services is as
 
01:28:20.639 --> 01:28:21.950 align:start position:0%
the definition of related Services is as
appears

01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
appears
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
at 34 CF R 3.39 sub paragraph a just say
 
01:28:31.229 --> 01:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
that that way parents can go oh I know I
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
can look it up I can see what it says
 
01:28:36.109 --> 01:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
don't give me a new definition don't
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
take it out of there so I think that
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be stripped just say we're
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
using the definition that the federals
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
use we're using the definition that the
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
regulation uses that way parents are not
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
in an insane Panic that our kids are not
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
going to get their services I will tell
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
you the first thing I thought
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
this says or I thought it said or I
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
thought it meant to say there were going
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
to be no outof District placements
 
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
because all approved programs are now
 
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
district if my child had not been
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to go to an outof District
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
placement I tell you I would be here as
 
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
a parent who did not have a living child
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
anymore she was so bullied that we had
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
to do an outof District placement for
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
her Mental Health
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
without some and if you ask School
 
01:29:31.629 --> 01:29:31.639 align:start position:0%
District administrators and they are
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
being honest with you they will tell you
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have the resources to meet the
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
needs of every single kid in our
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
community we don't have it and I
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
understand that that's a conversation
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
for the now split committee to the
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
finances but to say that everybody who
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
deals with our kids has to be certified
 
01:29:55.870 --> 01:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
every everybody I I get that we we
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
aspire to that but I don't know that we
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
have the funding for that but we have to
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that our kids don't fall
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
cracks as the other mother and I'm sorry
 
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
I didn't get her name spoke our kids are
 
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
not less than our kids may be
 
01:30:18.189 --> 01:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
different great that's what makes us a
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
community that's what makes multiple
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
colored leaves on the trees that we love
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
so much in the fall we're not all the
 
01:30:26.669 --> 01:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
same can you imagine how boring it would
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
be if we were all the
 
01:30:30.669 --> 01:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
same we would have no innovation we'd
 
01:30:31.629 --> 01:30:31.639 align:start position:0%
have no
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
creativity but our kids that have
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
special needs are not less than they're
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
not a burden they are kids that need to
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
be supported so they can grow up and be
 
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.470 align:start position:0%
be supported so they can grow up and be
amazing

01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
adults I just think honestly as somebody
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
who helped draft some of this stuff 10
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
years ago and I don't mean this
 
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
particular statute
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
the drafting of this is really really
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
bad and needs to go back if it was meant
 
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
to clarify it
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
failed I'd be happy to take any
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
questions if you've got them thank you
 
01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.669 align:start position:0%
questions if you've got them thank you
representative

01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
you so much for coming in front of us um
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
before I ask you my first question um
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're all we we're mostly parents on
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
this board and some of us have children
 
01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
on the Spectrum like I do so we we
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely positively have no intention
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
of taking any Services away from any
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
child that has an IEP or a 504 that is
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
never the intent of it given that I'm
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
just curious how did you learn about
 
01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.149 align:start position:0%
just curious how did you learn about
this

01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
bill I'm a member of a forum group on
 
01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
Facebook for parents of kids with
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
special needs and it came across the
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
Facebook post that this bill was being
 
01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
heard this morning now it had some
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
bullet points I please who whoever came
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
up with the Facebook post please don't
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
be offended I never take that at face
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
value I'm sorry I was trained as a
 
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer I I have drafted statutes I my
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite things you're going
 
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
to grown is the Internal Revenue code um
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
but but that's my autism that's my
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
there's an answer in here somewhere if
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
you follow it to The Logical conclusion
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
there's a definition there's an answer
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
it it it's convoluted that's for darn
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
sure but there's an answer here there's
 
01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.709 align:start position:0%
sure but there's an answer here there's
a

01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
definition that's and so when I read
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
those bullet points and was initially
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
horrified I said you know what I'm not
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
going to believe that just yet I'm going
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
to go and I'm going to read the bill
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
decide representative
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
kuger thank you madam chair thank you to
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
speaking to the beauty of our
 
01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
diversity I want to ask you are you
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
confident at this point that the general
 
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
education setting is properly addressed
 
01:33:06.669 --> 01:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
in this amendment of the
 
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
bill I haven't seen the amendment okay
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I think it just got passed out to to
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
to you all this morning I haven't seen
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
it I I can't speak to that I'm sorry
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I I just asked because in my
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
opinion that is extremely important that
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
that is covered here yeah I I'm afraid I
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
don't if you could do please take a
 
01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:27.470 align:start position:0%
don't if you could do please take a
minute

01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry I didn't bring my reading
 
01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:39.390 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry I didn't bring my reading
glasses

01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
that so for example in the amendment
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
when you look at at
 
01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
line um seven so you've got a a private
 
01:33:51.109 --> 01:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
provider of special education that that
 
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
would allow the out of District
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
placement that my daughter attended if
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's if that's what you're
 
01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.350 align:start position:0%
that's if that's what you're
specifically

01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:04.950 align:start position:0%
specifically
requesting

01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
um okay so the is this do you want to
 
01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
get into the nitty-gritty I I I don't
 
01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
know because my my ASD is really waving
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
its flag right now but um if if I look
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
at line 10 where it says this includes
 
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
specialized educational environments
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
comma and the accommodations
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
modifications and services delivered
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
within the general education setting to
 
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
support children with disabilities and
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
has approve been approved by the bureau
 
01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
that's one of the sentences that it's a
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
compound sentence you don't know whether
 
01:34:37.229 --> 01:34:37.239 align:start position:0%
it means a individual uh specialized
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
educational environments and B the
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
accommodations modifications or whether
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's all a run-on sentence from the
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
earlier part and then to add the
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
dangling phrase at the end and has been
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
bureau I'm not clear what that whole how
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
you parse that whole sentence that was
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns in the previous Bill
 
01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
and now my little policy wonk is going
 
01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
followup yes that's exactly where um I
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
was confused I just wanted to clarify
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to know also do you feel
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
that the classroom setting is covered
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
here no not
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
you any other questions
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you for
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
Bowden good morning my name is Lisa
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
Bodwin strategies for disability equity
 
01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
I am a Disability Policy professional uh
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'm also a mom and I live here in
 
01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:05.239 align:start position:0%
conquer um HB 699 contains a couple of
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
proposed changes to special education
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
law that are
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate however much of this bill
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
contains confusing contradictory
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
language as the last testifier
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
shared um it will stage New Hampshire to
 
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
be in conflict with Federal idea
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
law and I oppose this bill as
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
written parents across New Hampshire are
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
indeed frequently infuriated by the
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
special education process and rightfully
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
so it is true as rep katab reference
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
that students end up in boiler rooms and
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
this is indeed an
 
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
outrage so let's assume the bill comes
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
from a place of good intention seeking
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
to address issues highlighted by by the
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
coming incomplete audit as well as
 
01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.109 align:start position:0%
coming incomplete audit as well as
parent

01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
experiences nevertheless as written it
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
will likely lead to students with
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities not receiving a free
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate publication uh educa public
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
education in the least restrictive
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
environment as mandated by Ida and it
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
will lead to less inclusion for students
 
01:37:13.199 --> 01:37:14.149 align:start position:0%
will lead to less inclusion for students
with

01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities two colleagues who have not
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
yet been called have spent uh to testify
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
have spent their entire careers to
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
advance protections for special
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
education students and eliminate best
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
practices in schools across our our
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
country they they will be submitting
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
testimony with precise detailed analyses
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the proposed
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
changes I'm going
 
01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:38.109 align:start position:0%
changes I'm going
to

01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
talk about how this bill Bill's design
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
removes the presumption of students with
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities having the provision of
 
01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
their Educational Services first be in
 
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
the general education setting
 
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to say this in plain
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
language when an IEP team is discussing
 
01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
educational environment federal law
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
prioritizes and presumes a general
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
education classroom setting as the first
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
location to be considered the place
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
where a student receives their menu of
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
supports and services if you have not
 
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
heard this enough Ida is never meant to
 
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
be a location in a building it is a menu
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
of supports and services so students can
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
be staged for academic and social
 
01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:30.470 align:start position:0%
be staged for academic and social
emotional

01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
success it is only after this
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
consideration in the first that a
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
student may receive fape in a more
 
01:38:36.719 --> 01:38:37.950 align:start position:0%
student may receive fape in a more
restricted

01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
environment like self contain classrooms
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
resource rooms and rooms for delivering
 
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
related Services among the many
 
01:38:48.109 --> 01:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
challenges in this bill the language
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
literally removes general education from
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
the definition of educational
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
environment and while the amendment that
 
01:39:00.589 --> 01:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
was submitted proposes to reinsert it as
 
01:39:01.629 --> 01:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:39:01.639 --> 01:39:03.950 align:start position:0%
the last
testifier

01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
testifier
 
01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
explained um it it doesn't adequately do
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
so I want to remind this committee that
 
01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:13.159 align:start position:0%
that this is not only out of compliance
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
with federal and state law it is it is
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
not best practice in education to remove
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities from general
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
education classrooms more than 30 years
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
of research on inclusive education
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
indicates that students with
 
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities who are in general
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
education settings achieve better
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
academic and social emotional outcomes
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
than students who are in more segregated
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
settings moreover this committee should
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
know during the last 10 years replicated
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
studies now indicate that when students
 
01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:49.159 align:start position:0%
with IEPs are in general education
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
settings students without disabilities
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
also have better social emotional and
 
01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
academic outcomes substantively HB 699
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
is entrenching segregated settings for
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities which is the
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
reverse direction that New Hampshire
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
ought to be moving toward and honestly
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
we should be having bills that mandate
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
inclusive education as the standard the
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
gold standard and make New Hampshire the
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
gold standard for inclusive education
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
you can see a complete um my complete
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
remarks uh in my written
 
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I will I will say that
 
01:40:35.709 --> 01:40:35.719 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities and their
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
parents need RSA
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
186c to reflect protecting the rights of
 
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities to have the
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
same access to their Su School
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
communities as their peers without
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities this bill has many
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
complications that harm students with
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities to obtain fape as parents
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
attest school districts and teachers
 
01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
struggle with creating a culture of
 
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
belonging for students with
 
01:41:06.669 --> 01:41:06.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities so districts and teachers
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
struggle uh so students struggle to
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
obtain an
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
education I fear and many others fear
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
that HB 699 will Prov will provide
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
school districts with additional tools
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
to segregate students with disabilities
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
and broaden the existing Chasm between
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
parents and school districts leaving
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities to live with
 
01:41:32.189 --> 01:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
the long-term consequences this bill
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't fix what it hopes to
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
fix I urge you all to vote itl on HB
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
699 thank you representative
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
dry thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
question if you would consider um that
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
the definition change was to make it
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
more specific and and to avoid places
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
like storage rooms and things and make
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
these real places to be do you see or
 
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
can you show me in here where the
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
priority of least restrictive means
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
which is already in the law is
 
01:42:11.229 --> 01:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
gone what takes it
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
away in order for me to point that out
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
to you I need to sit and do a side by
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
side with the existing law and the and
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
the bill as proposed and as amended and
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't do that for you right
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
now I can get back to you with an answer
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%

General CL General Le classrooms um do
 
01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
you consider resource rooms to be
 
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
segregated I
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
do may I have a followup sure um so
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
given that um occupational therapy

physical therapy and spe therapy usually
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
are implemented on a one-on-one basis is
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
it appropriate to take the child out of
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
the general Le classroom in order to
 
01:43:06.589 --> 01:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
complete those
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
modalities that's a terrific
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
question it is important that the
 
01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
individual needs of each child are
 
01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
addressed when it comes to their related
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
Services there is extensive data
 
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
indicating that pushing in related
 
01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
Services is better for students and
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
their peers than pullouts the challenges
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
that school districts face is that when
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
we established special education it
 
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
started off in in trailers in
 
01:43:46.109 --> 01:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
schoolyards and in basements we started
 
01:43:49.629 --> 01:43:49.639 align:start position:0%
off with keeping them down the hallway
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
and as as we have
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
decided to move toward welcoming
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities into
 
01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.109 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities into
schoolroom

01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
schoolroom
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
settings we have discovered different
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
tools and strategies for making sure
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
that all students have general education
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
classrooms as the basis for which they
 
01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
receive um their educations so schools
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
have a long way to go in terms of
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
creating a culture of belonging there's
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of Technical and curriculum
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
changes that need to happen and I would
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
encourage this
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
committee to develop legislation to
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
focus on making sure that schools are
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
headed in that
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
direction I would also like to say that
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
anything that prevents students with
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities from being perceived
 
01:44:50.109 --> 01:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
as uh competent to learn competent to be
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
your friend competent to be the future
 
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
employee of a future small business
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
owner uh anything that denigrates
 
01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities as being seen
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
as viable members of their communities
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
as adults should not be allowed in our
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
public schools and when students without
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities don't see and experience
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
their peers with
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh as valued members of
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
their school buildings we are going to
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
continue to see people with disabilities
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
being ripped off of their rightful place
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
as Citizens in
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
America representative Murray thank you
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
madam chair thanks for taking my
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
question um one question that I have is
 
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not unintentionally this bill
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
could um as amended as well um
 
01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:42.679 align:start position:0%
unintentionally create building
 
01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
construction environments for future
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
constructions of buildings um that
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't fully encourage the creation of
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
a building as a whole that is an
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
inclusive environment for the general
 
01:45:52.599 --> 01:45:55.550 align:start position:0%
inclusive environment for the general
education

01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
setting that's your question that's my
 
01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
question um so with respect to
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
um segregating out resource rooms
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
self-contained classrooms Early
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
Childhood special education while those
 
01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:11.239 align:start position:0%
are components of an education we also
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the general
 
01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.589 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the general
education

01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
environments also support Learners in
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
their least restrictive environment
 
01:46:21.629 --> 01:46:21.639 align:start position:0%
right as the primary to your testimony
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
being the general ed class first
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
currently when Architects and school
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
boards are putting School building new
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
school building plans together they
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
build out segregated settings as part of
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
the architectural design of school
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
buildings and I can point to the middle
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
school project right here in conquered
 
01:46:43.589 --> 01:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the first design that was
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
floated by the school building committee
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
for the rebuild of the runlet school
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
included a and in fact a separate
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
segregated wing for students with
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities and parents had to
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
immediately and swiftly say no thank you
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
entrenched any other questions see none
 
01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:10.350 align:start position:0%
entrenched any other questions see none
thank

01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
hi good morning committee members and
 
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the time to listen
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
to My Testimony it's a little changed
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
because of hearing the other things that
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
um were said so uh kind of going to skip
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
around a little bit if that's okay um my
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
name is Caitlyn Bernier and I live in
 
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
marac um I am here in opposition of Bill
 
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
H of HB
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
699 um I'm just here to speak about
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
about how this would impact my family
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
but I know that it would have U negative
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
implications for so many um I am the
 
01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
mother of a highly intelligent
 
01:48:06.589 --> 01:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
11-year-old girl who just happens to
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
also have severe double deficit dyslexia
 
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:10.990 align:start position:0%
also have severe double deficit dyslexia
and

01:48:10.990 --> 01:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
ADHD and um I have concerns with the
 
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
verbiage and the amendment um that were
 
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
made to the approved program on page one
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
starting with line 20 eight um my
 
01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
daughter's needs were not able to be met
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
at her own School District we tried for
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of years and unfortunately um
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
there's not programs in every school for
 
01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
all the different kinds of learning um
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
brains that we have and she needed to
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
get Services out of District in order to
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
learn how to read this was years behind
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
her peers so her peers were all already
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
learning you know learning how to and
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
she was struggling and not able to and
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
had a lot of um mental health issues
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
with it as one would imagine when
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
everybody else can do the thing and
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
you're like I'm trying and I can't um
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so she needed to get Services
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the district and in the year
 
01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
that she has been there she's improved
 
01:49:20.189 --> 01:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
like three reading grade levels just by
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
being out of the district this verbage
 
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
in here that states that the approved
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
program um there it gets rid of the fact
 
01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
that it is approved by the State Board
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
of Education and maintained by the
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
school district and changes it to within
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
the school district um that is
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for all as aspects of the
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
provision of special education services
 
01:49:47.470 --> 01:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
and related supports so if that was to
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
be put into effect my daughter's out of
 
01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
District needs would not have been able
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
to be met and that's not fair to her or
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
to anybody else that might be in a
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
school district that doesn't have every
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
single reading program every single
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
specialist and every single thing that
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
you can imagine we worked with the
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
school we did everything we could for
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
years and it just wasn't the learning
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
the way that she needed to be taught to
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
read um but this would change her
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
ability to have her out of District
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
placement her personal goal
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
despite being out of the district she's
 
01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
only part-time half of the day now she
 
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
went from full day out to only half day
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
her goal is to get back into public
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
school with all of her peers she wants
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
to be like everybody else she should not
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
be treated differently just because she
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
learns differently and I think that says
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
a lot about her that despite sorry Mom
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
emotion despite being treated different
 
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
she wants to go back back and be with
 
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
people and show them that she doesn't
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
treat people different just because they
 
01:50:59.709 --> 01:50:59.719 align:start position:0%
might be different she wants everybody
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
in her school just like I want her to be
 
01:51:04.109 --> 01:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
able to be in a school with everybody
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
else um so uh sorry got a little
 
01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:10.470 align:start position:0%
else um so uh sorry got a little
emotional

01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
um uh so the um verbiage where you would
 
01:51:17.550 --> 01:51:17.560 align:start position:0%
take her uh ability to be out of
 
01:51:19.709 --> 01:51:19.719 align:start position:0%
district and put it in control of the
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
district the school district itself um
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
eliminates her options and my option as
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
a parent um I shouldn't have to pull her
 
01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
from public school because we're not
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
able to find a way to meet her needs um
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
public schools for everybody so we have
 
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to make everybody's needs met
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
um and then the last little bit um some
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
they had spoken about how um the speech
 
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
and language um uh teachers are all
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
certified but there's also like
 
01:51:55.069 --> 01:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
assistants that are there and there's
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists that may not be
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
licensed through the state as a thing so
 
01:52:02.669 --> 01:52:02.679 align:start position:0%
I I think that that's something to be
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration when they were
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
talking about how it's um uh
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative Hall you had mentioned
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
that there might be people that aren't
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
licensed and that would be the
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
Specialists the reading Specialists the
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
speech and language assistants um that
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
are maybe going through things but
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
aren't uh certified they would be
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
eliminated from that um I think that if
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
this bill like many have said was to
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
make things more clear um it just posed
 
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
more questions rather than adding any
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you thank you
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you madam
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
question I'm curious with the out of
 
01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
District placement was there a special
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
reading program that was used yes it was
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
it was um a combination of special
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
reading programs that were used that
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
weren't used within the school it was
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
lips and Wilson but also um using uh
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
just like some of the um speech to read
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
versus like uh spe text to speech to
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
text versus text to speech is how she
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
learns and we kind of teach people by
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
looking at it and then saying it and she
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
needs it the other way around and that's
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
not really in a public Ed yet I mean it
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
could be but not yet thank you so much
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:53:22.239 --> 01:53:23.669 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
much

01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.189 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:54:02.189 --> 01:54:02.199 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
morning representative katab Dr cordelli
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
who's not here at the moment but and
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
members of the education policy and
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
administration committee thank you so
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
much for um allowing us to be part of
 
01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
this discussion and to have an open
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
discussion about what it is that um we
 
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
really need in our Public School
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
District I'd like to share with you if I
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
may with the permission of this
 
01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
committee and the chair my daughters um
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
alternative and a augmentative and
 
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
alternative communication device is that
 
01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
allowable uh we don't really do props
 
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay I think it's important though for
 
01:54:41.069 --> 01:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
you to understand I'm not do if you can
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
just describe it I can show it to you I
 
01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
think it's important
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
because it is what she uses to
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
communicate and I think that
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
this is an important prop if you will
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
although I don't agree with that
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
terminology um but it's an important
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
example of how important related
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
services are to general education and to
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
the services of people with
 
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities I am here to oppose H Bill
 
01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
699 because I think it is very unclear
 
01:55:19.149 --> 01:55:19.159 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
SWS distrust amongst our community and
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
amongst this the representativ of the
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%

young woman who loves to laugh hang out

01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
life she has a diagnosis of Angelman
 
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
syndrome which is a chromosome 15
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
disorder and it affects gross motor
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
skills fine motor skills and speech
 
01:56:20.069 --> 01:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
hence she needs her communication
 
01:56:24.189 --> 01:56:24.199 align:start position:0%
device which is not a prop
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me but in this room it is not a
 
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
communication device I I hear you and
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
the reason that I brought it is to show
 
01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
the committee exactly what she needs in
 
01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.149 --> 01:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
education as she is unable to verbally
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
communicate she requires the use of an
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
augmentative and alternative
 
01:56:50.109 --> 01:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
communication device seen here it
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
provides her with robust communication
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
where she has access to words to
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
describe her day her classes her
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
feelings and to boss ala around to
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
request music and
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
movies this device is sophisticated in
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
nature and requires an a specialist to
 
01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
program it and to teach Ally and others
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
how to use it she is able to use it in
 
01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
class at home and in the
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
community it provides her with a sense
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
of agency and it is a window into her
 
01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
life and into her
 
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:30.280 align:start position:0%

continue to provide her with a unique
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity to explore who
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
she is as a person and a lifelong
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
learner she has a self-confidence that's
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
contagious a curiosity that's enviable
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
and a smile that lights up the
 
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
rim this is in large part due to her
 
01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
meaningful inclusion in general
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
education that is
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
promoted the values of learning within a
 
01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:31.750 align:start position:0%
promoted the values of learning within a
larger

01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
Community this bill as it is written is
 
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
confusing at best leaving much to
 
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation and has the distinct
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
potential to promote seclusion and
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
isolation by the words used to define
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities the late Christa mff a
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
teacher at High who would have been the
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
first teacher in space once said I touch
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:07.470 --> 01:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
teach all students including those with
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities are an invaluable part of
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
our community's country I'm sorry
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
invaluable part of our country's future
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
they deserve inclusive education that
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
provides them with what is
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
possible thank you
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative

Murray thank you madam chair and just
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
for the record I would just like to
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
clarify this is um not a prop with all
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
due respect is this piece of assisted
 
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
technology that was approved yeah I I
 
01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
understand that we just generally don't
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
allow a show and tell basically from
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
testifying thank
 
01:59:49.629 --> 01:59:49.639 align:start position:0%
you representative NATO thank you madam
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for all coming and
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
testifying so we can get a really good
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
grasp of what's going on um as far as
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
the current uh
 
02:00:03.149 --> 02:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
law uh would you revert back to that or
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
what about getting with the uh current
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
one that's before us and the amendment
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
specifically I guess so we're not
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
looking at discriminatory uh I know of a
 
02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
12-year-old that is helping somebody in
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
their class that's nonverbal and we need
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
to integrate everybody into society and
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
grows make them into adults so uh would
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
it be better just to go back to the
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
original Law or amend the
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
amendment I really can't speak to that
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
only because I'm not um well versed in
 
02:00:35.390 --> 02:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
policy but what I can tell you is that
 
02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
there have been people here that have um
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
provided testimony on what would be the
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
best course of action here I do think
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
that the the wording in the original
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
document was confusing at best I think
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
that the amendment clarifies it a bit
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is that any
 
02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:54.189 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is that any
that

02:00:54.189 --> 02:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
would raise confusion as to where
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
education takes place um would only
 
02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
serve to create segregation with kids
 
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
poor kids with disabilities it really
 
02:01:10.069 --> 02:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be extremely clear in the law
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
that we are providing general education
 
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
to all students where it's the least
 
02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:17.589 align:start position:0%
to all students where it's the least
restrictive

02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
environment well uh I agree we need to
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
integrate these children in in the
 
02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:24.669 align:start position:0%
integrate these children in in the
learning

02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:24.679 align:start position:0%
learning
 
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
environment and
 
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
um so so we're not discriminating uh and
 
02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh so what I'm saying is would you get
 
02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:36.750 align:start position:0%
uh so what I'm saying is would you get
with

02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill here the amendment and
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
try to amend mat that uh as far as being
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
Clarity is concerned if you're asking me
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
if the amendment goes further with um
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
clarification I believe it does but I
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.950 --> 02:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
done any other
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
questions oh represent
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
moris hello thank you for taking my
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
question um this is regards to the
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
special education environment um as we
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
heard from the prime sponsor where we
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
had some situations where students were
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
being put in boiler rooms it sounds to
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
me like we might want to put an
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment to make the
 
02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:22.629 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment to make the
general

02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
general
 
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
education um standard be the classroom
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
and if for some reason the child has to
 
02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
be removed temporarily from the
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
classroom they don't end up in boiler
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
rooms but instead can be in a
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
more classroom type setting temporarily
 
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
until they can return to general
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
population uh so I guess yeah sorry my
 
02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
question would be would you be on board
 
02:02:51.390 --> 02:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
with that I think so obviously I do not
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
want any
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
child anywhere to be taught in a boiler
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
room I think that's pretty um
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory I think that we need to
 
02:03:02.189 --> 02:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
go back to the people that really
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
understand policy and really Hammer this
 
02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
out to make sure that we don't have any
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences I am not a
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
policy person what I can tell you is
 
02:03:14.430 --> 02:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
that my daughter has had a really good
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
experience at the conquered um School
 
02:03:19.149 --> 02:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
District because of inclusion and
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
general education
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing none thank
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.470 --> 02:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
you we're actually very far behind um so
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
knowing the intention of the bill is
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
there anyone that would not want to
 
02:03:40.599 --> 02:03:42.310 align:start position:0%
there anyone that would not want to
testify

02:03:42.310 --> 02:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:03:46.069 --> 02:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay I I think we're going to put a time
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
limit um of 3 minutes on testimony
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
now just so we can get this moving along
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.709 --> 02:04:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
someone shy this is my first time and my
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
son Tyler's first time here so bear with
 
02:04:30.870 --> 02:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
us welcome come come
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
come exactly this is the teenager like
 
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
oh I don't really want to um I just have
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
to say about the communication device
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
being a problem I I know that wasn't a
 
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
targeted attack but I I bristled to the
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
student that uses that device it's it's
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
every bit as functional as his
 
02:05:01.069 --> 02:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
wheelchair it's it it certainly was no
 
02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
disrespect y it y yep I I get it and I
 
02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
think my perspective as a parent with a
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
child with a disability is different
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
just a sidebar I'm going to go off
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
script for a second here um coming here
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
we went into the state house by mistake
 
02:05:19.069 --> 02:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
we didn't know we were over here so a
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
lot of people said oh there's this
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
really cool tunnel you can go
 
02:05:25.069 --> 02:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
your elevator is
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
broken I know and I spoke to four people
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
I I don't know who they are the the lift
 
02:05:34.589 --> 02:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
to get down to the ramp um everyone's
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
like oh that's always broken that's been
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
broken for a long time so I I feel like
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
Ada access to to buildings especially
 
02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
the the state capital that the language
 
02:05:48.189 --> 02:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
isn't it's not unclear it's not
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
confusing and yet we still had to go
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
outside got lost went around we were
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%

grade they may have different academic
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
goals but they share a fundamental right
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
to be valued and included in in their
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%

Therapy occupational therapy together
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
his support team have developed a
 
02:06:46.589 --> 02:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
structured school day that allows him to
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
be present in some general education
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
settings while working on his individual

PA of professionals general education
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
teachers and most importantly his
 
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
peers kind of Off Script just I I was
 
02:07:07.629 --> 02:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
one of the people that posted something
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
on on Facebook and start up a lot of I
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
think panic because as it was written it
 
02:07:15.549 --> 02:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
was very confusing um in that post I got
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
into a discussion with a supporter of
 
02:07:19.709 --> 02:07:19.719 align:start position:0%
the bill who I I kind of said that's
 
02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
that's my dream is to have Tyler in a
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
general Leed classroom working on the
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
things in his IEP but in the general led
 
02:07:31.149 --> 02:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
classroom not in the learning support
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
room sidebar the the boiler rooms aren't
 
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
called boiler rooms those in some cases
 
02:07:39.069 --> 02:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
are called The Learning support rooms so
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
no one's going to say you know Tyler
 
02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
no one's going to say you know Tyler
spent

02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
spent
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
14 periods in a boiler room it's you
 
02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
know he was taken to the learning
 
02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
support room or the secluded classroom
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a slippery slope um
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
an example he was in a math class um his
 
02:07:57.629 --> 02:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
peers were doing long
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
division he is not at grade level with
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
his math skills so Tyler was able to
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
participate and work on his math skills
 
02:08:08.189 --> 02:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
which are identifying numbers a speech
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
goal which is saying the number either
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
verbally or with his speech device um
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
that has the same software on Tyler
 
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
could use that prop here
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
um how we worked it out was Tyler would
 
02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
roll a dice with his peers and he would
 
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
identify you know that's a six that's a
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
four that's a three and he would help
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
his peers who were learning long
 
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
division come up
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
with their math problems so Tyler's not
 
02:08:38.109 --> 02:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
doing long division but he with in a
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
class that is teaching long division is
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
working on his individualized math goal
 
02:08:45.709 --> 02:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
and a bonus speech goal because he's
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
working with his peers um so it's the
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether par
 
02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:53.629 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether par
professionals

02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
02:08:57.149 --> 02:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
teach the goals are set by the certified
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
um Educators but it I don't see how it
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
could work some someone on that social
 
02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
media post actually said you know you
 
02:09:06.510 --> 02:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
expect to work with a special ed teacher
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
a general ed teacher and a parah or a
 
02:09:11.069 --> 02:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
service provider good luck with that I
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
thought yeah that's exactly what I what
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
I do
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
want um I'm concerned that some of the
 
02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
changes proposed in this bill as they're
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
written and the revisions to the
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
definitions regarding programs and
 
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
environment services and instruction are
 
02:09:26.189 --> 02:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
continuing confusing at best and at
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
worst May hinder an inclusive education
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
experience for Tyler and other students
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
with support needs the changes could
 
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
limit Tyler's access to a typical high
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
school experience that he very he has
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
every right to enjoy I oppose HB 699 in
 
02:09:42.669 --> 02:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
its present form and urge there to be
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
that it be thoroughly reviewed to ensure
 
02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:46.280 align:start position:0%
the proposed language does not lead to
 
02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
more restrictive educational environment
 
02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
it's crucial to consider the needs of
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
students like Tyler we Define the
 
02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:54.920 align:start position:0%

uh groups about this bill today and I
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
barely slept at all last night thinking
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
about it and what I would say today and
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
I did put together
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
a a testimony for you but you know what
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
things have changed a little bit and I
 
02:11:36.270 --> 02:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
am glad that an amendment has come forth
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
I am very grateful for the discussion
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
and the questions that have come forth
 
02:11:45.069 --> 02:11:45.079 align:start position:0%
I my daughter's going into high I'm
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
shaking right now I normally don't get
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
nervous but this really worries me um my
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
daughter is uh has tomorrow her tour of
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
the high school and it would absolutely
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
devastate me to think that she would not
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
be given the same opportunities to take
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
any and all general education class that
 
02:12:09.790 --> 02:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
she would like to um and I really
 
02:12:13.149 --> 02:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee just to take a
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
breath vote for this bill to be itl and
 
02:12:19.149 --> 02:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
think about if we want to make
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
improvements to the special education
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
system which I am all for absolutely we
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
can always improve but if you look at
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
all the people in this room and everyone
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
who has testified today I don't think
 
02:12:32.669 --> 02:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
there's one person here who would not
 
02:12:36.669 --> 02:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
come together collaborate on a committee
 
02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
and hear from uh Professionals in the
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
industry parents collaborators
 
02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we're all here and we are
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
ready to to talk and share and come up
 
02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
with the best improvements Al together
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
that we can for our children and our
 
02:12:56.669 --> 02:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
students and I really um encourage you
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of the fact that you
 
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
have so many constituents that are here
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
for you to answer questions here to
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
support here to collaborate here to help
 
02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
and make change and I really would love
 
02:13:13.149 --> 02:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to go back to my daughter and
 
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
hear about her tour of the high school
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
and all the classes that she's excited
 
02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
about taking and to know um to be able
 
02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
to tell her hey mom came together with
 
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
so many other Advocates and parents
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%

would encourage you to oppose this
 
02:13:39.870 --> 02:13:39.880 align:start position:0%

02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
slow down let's really collaborate and
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%

okay now I know some of this might not
 
02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
be relevant given what the sponsors have
 
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
said but just because I'm a baker
 
02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean I have to sugar coat
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
anything so here it goes ableism it's
 
02:14:41.870 --> 02:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
racism and discrimination against people
 
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
with disabilities this bill is chalk
 
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
full of it taking away resources that
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
students depen and isolating them from
 
02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
their friends why I virgin you to vote
 
02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
no on this
 
02:14:54.549 --> 02:14:54.559 align:start position:0%
once upon a time a little girl who was
 
02:14:57.149 --> 02:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
autistic had a support system whenever
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
she needed a quiet place to eat lunch a
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
classroom with the teacher was open she
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
had weekly occupational therapy sessions
 
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
there are pair of professionals to vent
 
02:15:08.189 --> 02:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
to or get help from when spiraling if
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
she needed a break from classes she was
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
a loud one fire drill she was worn ahead
 
02:15:14.910 --> 02:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
of time overwhelmed by massive amounts
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
of homework assignments were modified
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
for her over time she developed a strong
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
sense of self-awareness strengths weak
 
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
spots triggers she learned how to
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
advocate for herself to get what she
 
02:15:28.109 --> 02:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
needed to succeed she graduated high
 
02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
school and moved on to one of the best
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
universities in the nation and graduated
 
02:15:35.069 --> 02:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
magna laa she became a grown woman
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
who runs her own small business got in
 
02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
the front cover of her hometown's
 
02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
magazine and has been a guest on several
 
02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
neurodiversity blogs to be a role model
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
for future generation that little girl
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
her you that's right I wouldn't be who
 
02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:52.559 align:start position:0%
or where I am now without the resources
 
02:15:54.910 --> 02:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
and support I got during my pre-ol years
 
02:15:56.510 --> 02:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
would you take away a cane or a seeing
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
eye dog from someone that's who's blind
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
would you force someone who then needs a
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
wheelchair to to walk deny someone who's
 
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
deaf an ASL interpreter in the classroom
 
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
how about taking away an oxygen tank for
 
02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
people who can't breathe without it if
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
the answer to all these questions is no
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
then I suggest you vote a such on on
 
02:16:14.549 --> 02:16:14.559 align:start position:0%
this bill if you think you can slap
 
02:16:16.270 --> 02:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
Judith human the mother of the
 
02:16:18.189 --> 02:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
disability rights movement the one
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
responsible for the Ida and the Ada in
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
the face with this a bill you've got
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
another thing coming my advice vote know
 
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
because I refuse to let you take away
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
what I've depended on from future
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
Generations thank you any
 
02:16:37.629 --> 02:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:16:37.639 --> 02:16:41.270 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
much

02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
Carly you're you're welcome but
 
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
seriously it
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
seriously don't you don't you dare take
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
away what I've depended on from from
 
02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:55.349 align:start position:0%
away what I've depended on from from
future

02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
mshen hello thank you committee members
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
y'all are getting a lot of input um and
 
02:17:20.190 --> 02:17:20.200 align:start position:0%
some of it may just be out of sheer
 
02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:21.709 align:start position:0%
some of it may just be out of sheer
confusion

02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
um we've already heard lots of
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
commentary uh about that uh my name is
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
Michael mshan I'm from Rochester New
 
02:17:29.589 --> 02:17:29.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire born and raised there
 
02:17:32.669 --> 02:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
currently living there um I've submitted
 
02:17:35.549 --> 02:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
to you some written testimony um but
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
given all the information that we've
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
gained this morning I want to flip over
 
02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
to just a few specific points and I will
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
probably resubmit additional information
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh in an attempt to be helpful
 
02:17:52.349 --> 02:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
um I I think
 
02:17:54.669 --> 02:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately based in Good
 
02:17:58.709 --> 02:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
Intentions the the proposed uh Bill HB
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh 699 and the amendment that was
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
submitted um just further confused
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
issues unnecessarily so um part of it
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
just maybe the emphasis is on the wrong
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
cabable um I think if you know people
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
are concerned about Paris then let's say
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
something about how we're utilizing
 
02:18:16.679 --> 02:18:18.910 align:start position:0%
something about how we're utilizing
Paris

02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
Paris
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
um uh some specific things I I do want
 
02:18:24.190 --> 02:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure to note here
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
um appreciated and I think it's clear
 
02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
the definitions for Bureau acquired
 
02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
brain injury specialed uh information
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
system great good on those several
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
others need some discussion and we can
 
02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
help make those more clear for your
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
intent uh as well as
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
um so let me just quickly go through
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
some things I've heard this morning
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
around educational
 
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
environment adding yet another layer of
 
02:18:54.509 --> 02:18:54.519 align:start position:0%
definitions for specialized educational
 
02:18:57.709 --> 02:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
environments seems unnecessary given in
 
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
idea we already have definitions of the
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
Continuum of alternative settings each
 
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
of those has have operational
 
02:19:06.509 --> 02:19:06.519 align:start position:0%
definitions we've deferred to those
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
historically now adding in another layer
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
of specialized education environments
 
02:19:14.509 --> 02:19:14.519 align:start position:0%
seems clearly from the input this
 
02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
morning problematic and will will raise
 
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
concerns um if the bureau is interested
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
in having extra Focus Fus on three
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
particular settings and program types
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
then let's name that more clearly and
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
and provide that guidance
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
um general education setting is a
 
02:19:34.509 --> 02:19:34.519 align:start position:0%
setting for Service delivery for special
 
02:19:37.389 --> 02:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
education services and I'm concerned
 
02:19:39.870 --> 02:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
that the the new definitions of
 
02:19:41.349 --> 02:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
specialized education environment are
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
going to be really complicating for some
 
02:19:45.870 --> 02:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
administrators and school Personnel uh
 
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
who are clearly already struggling
 
02:19:53.469 --> 02:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
um in term of related
 
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
Services the there's lots of confusion
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
around this when I first read it I
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
thought what are they trying to do here
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
now with a a finer Focus losing the
 
02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:06.590 align:start position:0%
now with a a finer Focus losing the
current

02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
definition does still eliminate some
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
specific protections to children like
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
insuring related services are provided
 
02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
when placement has been court ordered
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
and guidance for districts regarding
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
boarding a child nearby the place
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
instruction those are not in idea and I
 
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
hear the bells are ringing and I got two
 
02:20:27.309 --> 02:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
more points but I will adhere your time
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
limits is there any questions
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hall Madam chair and
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question could
 
02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
you tell us what one of those the most
 
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
important Point left
 
02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
out uh under specially designed
 
02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
instruction again if the concern is
 
02:20:43.870 --> 02:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
about Paras and I share several concerns
 
02:20:46.110 --> 02:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
there let's specify maybe what Paris
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't shouldn't be doing versus
 
02:20:50.670 --> 02:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
layering in a requirement to use
 
02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:51.830 align:start position:0%
layering in a requirement to use
certified

02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
certified
 
02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel for all of the special
 
02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
education services um if we're training
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
and coaching and supervising parents
 
02:21:02.590 --> 02:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
there are things that they can do that
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
will be both effective for students and
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
Le and more cost effective for school
 
02:21:09.309 --> 02:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
districts I see taxpayer dollar red
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
flags all over this the way that it's
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
currently worded uh and that could be
 
02:21:17.230 --> 02:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
really problematic thank you any other
 
02:21:19.389 --> 02:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
Esposito uh thank you honorable chair
 
02:21:45.150 --> 02:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
and uh committee members um my name is
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
lisis esposo I'm the executive director
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
at AEL New Hampshire um I'm also a
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
resident of Brookline New Hampshire um
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
as someone who worked directly with
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities as a par
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
professional a special education teacher
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
an advocate a parent and a friend there
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
are several components to this bill that
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
are alarming I think we've all addressed
 
02:22:04.910 --> 02:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of these points today um I just
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
really want to emphasize that um you
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
know I think a lot of us are really
 
02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about this bill and I really
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
like the the atmosphere of collaboration
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
to try to make this work I think all of
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
us here want to see students with
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
special education teach uh special
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
education um succeed
 
02:22:22.830 --> 02:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't call myself a boiler room
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
teacher but my off my first classroom
 
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
teacher when I was um my first year
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
teaching had office dividers and a
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
shower curtain for a door um so I I
 
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
understand that um my students were um
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
were for the most part left completely
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
away from the general education
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
environment I had to really push to get
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
them there and it was very challenging
 
02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
and you know when we when we start the
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
conversation you know in a resource room
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
or segregator room um it's really hard
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
to get back in there um so um I know
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of arguments about you
 
02:22:54.990 --> 02:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
know changing the definitions and
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
removing things um I guess I really want
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
to emphasize the importance of you know
 
02:23:01.870 --> 02:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have a a long long
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
history of making things um you know
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
better and we shouldn't be stripping
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
things we should be redefining them and
 
02:23:11.550 --> 02:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
we should be improving our education and
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
the federal standards are just at their
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
basement and I think we could continue
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
to strive and especially with some
 
02:23:18.429 --> 02:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
concerns coming from the federal level I
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
know recently there was a HR 899 which
 
02:23:22.349 --> 02:23:22.359 align:start position:0%
wants to terminate the doe we're we're
 
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
really concerned about that and we start
 
02:23:26.590 --> 02:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
stripping definitions today and you know
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know what's going to come um
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
from that level too so I think it's
 
02:23:31.150 --> 02:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
important to really hold um New
 
02:23:33.389 --> 02:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire special education um at the
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
highest regard so and I have a testimony
 
02:23:38.110 --> 02:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
that I wrote off but I'll alter it just
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
based off our conversation today thank
 
02:23:41.670 --> 02:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
02:23:45.309 --> 02:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question and thank
 
02:23:46.990 --> 02:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so with
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
regard to some of the things you
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned um regarding sort of the pull
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
out model that is no longer really best
 
02:23:54.510 --> 02:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
practice and we're talking about pushin
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
models and differentiated instruction
 
02:23:59.269 --> 02:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
methods do you see there being an
 
02:24:01.950 --> 02:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for more clarity around that
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
type of best practice instruction being
 
02:24:06.190 --> 02:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the bill or at least a
 
02:24:09.269 --> 02:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
find somewhere else I think I think more
 
02:24:10.990 --> 02:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question repres um I
 
02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
think it' be helpful to really Define it
 
02:24:14.750 --> 02:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
um pull out Services don't work for
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
everybody um I've been in models um in
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
the in the schools where you know it was
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
primarily pull out but the goal should
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
be to bring the kid back into the
 
02:24:23.790 --> 02:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
general education classroom so to
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
specify that and clarify that in this
 
02:24:27.070 --> 02:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
bill be fantastic I think this is a
 
02:24:28.269 --> 02:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
really great opportunity to really
 
02:24:32.670 --> 02:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
be representative
 
02:24:37.870 --> 02:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:24:41.309 --> 02:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us um you stated
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
that you think we are stripping
 
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
definitions but equally do you think
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
we're replacing those definitions as
 
02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
well I guess it's a um a little bit of
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
both I think when we start removing
 
02:24:54.670 --> 02:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
definitions like functionally blinds you
 
02:24:55.950 --> 02:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
know we're we're leaving a population
 
02:24:59.070 --> 02:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
that are relying on those supports to um
 
02:25:00.750 --> 02:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
you know kind of reestablish what they
 
02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
need to be um I think redefining it is a
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
kind of a different conversation I think
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
we should be adding to our definitions
 
02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
and forur and clarifying things as
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to removing
 
02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
them any other
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm glad the microphone's already on so
 
02:25:35.309 --> 02:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
I don't have to touch it with my jermy
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
fingers thank
 
02:25:40.269 --> 02:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
you I'll just slide myself over so my
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
name is Bonnie Dunham and I live in
 
02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
miramac New
 
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire while I believe that the bill
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
has some was written with the best of
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
intentions and there are some some okay
 
02:25:52.030 --> 02:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
things in it and the amendment made it
 
02:25:54.349 --> 02:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
better I still have concerns about
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
several of the proposed changes first is
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
the proposal to remove the definition of
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
related Services while both idea and the
 
02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire standards include a
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
definition of related Services one of
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire standards references the W
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
an idea neither include that the school
 
02:26:10.590 --> 02:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
district May board a child as close to
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
the place where instruction is to be
 
02:26:14.269 --> 02:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
furnished as possible and then provide
 
02:26:16.710 --> 02:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
transportation to and from that place um
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
to where the child is going to be
 
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
receiving that instruction well that's a
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
rare situation when that would be needed
 
02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
unless it's included in another New
 
02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and I did my best to look
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
um I it would be lost I would hate to
 
02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
see it eliminated as an option for
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
school districts and families who may
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
decide that that's the way they can
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
provide a fape to that child in the
 
02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment also since
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire standards reference
 
02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
idea um if idea were amended to change
 
02:26:45.870 --> 02:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
the definition of related Services all
 
02:26:48.110 --> 02:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
we did was reference idea ours would
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
automatically revert to whatever lower
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
standard they set because I haven't seen
 
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
them raise their standards a lot lately
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
um and so regarding the definition of
 
02:27:00.269 --> 02:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
functionally blind it may be okay to
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
remove that I don't know I do know
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
though in 2006 Bill Finn who was the
 
02:27:06.429 --> 02:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
head of blind services for Vocational
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation told the committee that
 
02:27:11.790 --> 02:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
it was added because um the the U I'm
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
sorry the national Federation of the
 
02:27:14.910 --> 02:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
blind asked states to add that
 
02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
definition to ensure they all had
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
protections for children with functional
 
02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
blindness lot's changed since 200 six so
 
02:27:22.469 --> 02:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
it may not be needed but I'd recommend
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
checking with future Insight um who
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
serves parents um children with vision
 
02:27:30.150 --> 02:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
parents before doing that I'm glad that
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor added special before the
 
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
term educational environment um because
 
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
it really you just using educational
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
environment that means settings in every
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
other place in the law it doesn't it
 
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
includes um playgrounds and lunchrooms
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
it isn't just um the classroom and I I
 
02:27:49.389 --> 02:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
would like to see something added that
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
would emphasize that the regular Ed
 
02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
classroom is the first consideration I
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
know it's in um the L Provisions but
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
with all of the concerns that have been
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
raised today it would be nice to hyper
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
emphasize it um sorry I
 
02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I asked that language be added to
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that a par professional or other
 
02:28:12.990 --> 02:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
individual um who was working under the
 
02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
direct supervision of a special
 
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
education teacher May assist in the
 
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
provision of related of special
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
education or um or specialized
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
instruction or may reinforce what the
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
special education teacher has taught so
 
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
that that can happen in the general
 
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
education classroom more easily there's
 
02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
a there's a lot more kids with
 
02:28:32.910 --> 02:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities than there are specialed
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
teachers out there and so I'd hate to
 
02:28:37.269 --> 02:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
see kids get um get lost along the way
 
02:28:40.990 --> 02:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
because of that shortage um also this is
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
picky but specially designed instruction
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
it says it's defined in idea and me and
 
02:28:48.269 --> 02:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
means if it's defined in idea that's
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
what it means and so I think what this
 
02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
means to say it's to find an Ida and is
 
02:28:55.389 --> 02:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
and then the extra qualifiers that we
 
02:28:58.950 --> 02:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
have um and so I would like to recommend
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
that this be referred to inim study
 
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
because I think it can be fixed but um
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
and I think there are a lot of people
 
02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
here who said they're willing to help do
 
02:29:10.349 --> 02:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you any
 
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
Jane Bon bullu I'm the executive
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
director for the New Hampshire
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
Association of special ed administrators
 
02:29:42.349 --> 02:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm here representing over 300
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
members of leaders in the field of
 
02:29:47.269 --> 02:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
special education I'm not going to um
 
02:29:49.269 --> 02:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
rehash any of the information that's
 
02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
already been brought to your attention
 
02:29:54.190 --> 02:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
um as you'll see in in my testimony I
 
02:29:56.590 --> 02:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
started off with um recognizing the
 
02:29:59.710 --> 02:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
importance of these rules and that um
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's really important for us to get
 
02:30:04.750 --> 02:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
them right um equally important is that
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
all of the voices that you've heard
 
02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
today from all of the valued
 
02:30:11.070 --> 02:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are typ typically involved
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
when rule changes uh come about and we
 
02:30:16.830 --> 02:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
work together collaboratively and our
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
members um were really taken back and
 
02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
surprise that all of the revisions were
 
02:30:23.309 --> 02:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
uh being made and that all of the
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders had not been at the table
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
for the conversation which resulted in a
 
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion today so while well
 
02:30:33.870 --> 02:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
attend while it was well intended um we
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
would say that you know we certainly
 
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
don't um support this bill and would ask
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
that um more folks be brought to the
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
table for further conversation
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
specifically some of the things that um
 
02:30:49.269 --> 02:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
our members uh looked at in this bill um
 
02:30:51.429 --> 02:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
there was concern raised around uh the
 
02:30:53.469 --> 02:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
definition of specially designed
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
instruction um it does start off with
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
Federal rules at least in the original
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
Bill and then took a New Hampshire twist
 
02:31:03.309 --> 02:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
um when you look at the bill as it was
 
02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
written it it talks about especially
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
design instruction only being provided
 
02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
by special Educators and related service
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
providers we know people like um reading
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
Specialists who are not special ed
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
certified who are highly trained in
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
specialized reading programs um should
 
02:31:23.469 --> 02:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
be able to and and in terms of providing
 
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
specialized reading instructions such as
 
02:31:28.510 --> 02:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
Orton Gillingham be considered as
 
02:31:30.830 --> 02:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
providing specially designed instruction
 
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
you have adaptive physical education
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
teachers who are providing very specific
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
PE to students that wouldn't be um
 
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
considered specially designed
 
02:31:42.670 --> 02:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
instruction so I think you know going
 
02:31:44.349 --> 02:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
back to the federal definition and
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
sticking to that would be uh really
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
important so I would just close by
 
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
saying from our Viewpoint um the bill as
 
02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
written even with the Amendments really
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
lacks Clarity is rather confusing and um
 
02:32:00.230 --> 02:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
is certainly could use a lot of editing
 
02:32:02.670 --> 02:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
and changing and I'd be happy to answer
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you any
 
02:32:08.670 --> 02:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.710 --> 02:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for letting
 
02:32:24.389 --> 02:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
me testify this morning um my name is
 
02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
Heather Barker and I am the SSC director
 
02:32:29.710 --> 02:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
here uh conquered for the uh New
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school administrators
 
02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
Association so supporting superintendent
 
02:32:35.389 --> 02:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
and central office administrators and
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
better understanding how we serve our
 
02:32:38.870 --> 02:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable
 
02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
population so I um have been in
 
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with the Department of Ed
 
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
and other groups around the state and as
 
02:32:48.510 --> 02:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
um nhsaa we talked about this bill last
 
02:32:51.150 --> 02:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
week during our our legislative priority
 
02:32:54.190 --> 02:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
meetings and we were in favor initially
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
of supporting the idea because it is a
 
02:32:58.590 --> 02:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
great idea when we can match what's
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
happening in our state rules with the
 
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
federal rules because it cleans up
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings um people who may you
 
02:33:09.670 --> 02:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
know misinterpret or narrowly interpret
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
things so language really matters
 
02:33:15.230 --> 02:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
vocabulary really matters definitions
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
really matter and then over the weekend
 
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
I um saw a lot of stuff on social media
 
02:33:24.349 --> 02:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
tremendous fear in the parent population
 
02:33:27.870 --> 02:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
who are our partners about the loss of
 
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
Rights for their children and that was
 
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
not I'm sure I was really glad to hear
 
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
that the intention of this bill however
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
given how it's been written even with
 
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
the Amendments it really is clear to me
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
as someone who is
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
incredibly committed to children and
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
their needs we need to take a look at
 
02:33:53.070 --> 02:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
this again because my real concern now
 
02:33:54.990 --> 02:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
after listening to all of this if we
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
can't come to an agreement on what it
 
02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
all means or we change a word here or
 
02:34:00.910 --> 02:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
word there are we going to be all set
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
that lack of clarity around those really
 
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
important things like the Continuum of
 
02:34:09.389 --> 02:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
services like not every student can be
 
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
educated in the general education
 
02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
classrooms if we are talking about our
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
private special ed settings rate setting
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
and that whole responsibility in our
 
02:34:21.269 --> 02:34:21.279 align:start position:0%
department of V I don't even see that in
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
here so I'm wor I worry about people's
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
good intentions can be misinterpreted or
 
02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
narrowly interpreted so that's the fear
 
02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
you're sensing from parents is okay if
 
02:34:34.110 --> 02:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
it's not clearly stated then they're not
 
02:34:35.710 --> 02:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
going to provide it to me because some
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
people have had bad experiences unfortun
 
02:34:41.309 --> 02:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in serving and advocating
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
for their children and working with
 
02:34:45.150 --> 02:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
school district so that narrow
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation could be a real problem
 
02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
around that related Services the license
 
02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
ing there's differences between licenses
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
and credentials there's special
 
02:34:57.070 --> 02:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
education there's related services and
 
02:34:58.590 --> 02:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
then there's par Educators who are
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually a supplemental Aid and support
 
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm really concerned when I hear
 
02:35:06.269 --> 02:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
that stuff because frankly the par
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
educator I I was glad to see that we
 
02:35:10.349 --> 02:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
have nessus in here right our
 
02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
information system the electronic one
 
02:35:14.910 --> 02:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
however listed in the special ed Service
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
Grid in the dropdown where people choose
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
who is providing the special education
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
right now we still have par educator
 
02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
there I brought it up again the
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
department edit is working on getting it
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
taken out but when you have that level
 
02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
of confusion this is how things like
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
this happen so I would love to support
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
Clarity definitions common vocabulary
 
02:35:39.950 --> 02:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
streamlining making our state consistent
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
with the federal rules however right now
 
02:35:45.550 --> 02:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
as it is I can't support it thank you
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative dry thank you and thank
 
02:35:50.429 --> 02:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question if we did
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
this in interim study and did all those
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
things would that be a Absol absolutely
 
02:35:58.910 --> 02:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
would support cleaning up our
 
02:36:01.710 --> 02:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
definitions thank you any other
 
02:36:06.110 --> 02:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
manani good morning thank you all uh
 
02:36:24.110 --> 02:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
Kristen monani Office of the advocate
 
02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
for special education here in New
 
02:36:30.269 --> 02:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are um really more
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
often than not um articulating parent
 
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
voices in disputes over what their
 
02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
students need so definitely very
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
committed to ensuring that our students
 
02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
receive um every piece in the proper
 
02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
manner of special education to which
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
they're entitled um I I don't want to
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
Echo a lot of what everyone said I want
 
02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
to try to provide some clarification on
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
a few points but the one thing that I
 
02:36:58.269 --> 02:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
urge that we not lose is that um we've
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
had many cases in our office and I know
 
02:37:01.710 --> 02:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education is aware of
 
02:37:05.269 --> 02:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
this as well where we do need um some
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
better legislation
 
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
around the question of educational
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
environments under broad approved
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
special education programs because we
 
02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
are seeing over and over and over again
 
02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's not an isolated case instances
 
02:37:24.510 --> 02:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
where the concept of the
 
02:37:28.349 --> 02:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
um substantially separate classrooms um
 
02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
on the Continuum
 
02:37:33.070 --> 02:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
becomes uh they're really called
 
02:37:36.269 --> 02:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
self-contained special education classes
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
become isolated offices spots and
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
hallways this is where you get the
 
02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
Boiler Room reference I don't want to
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
imply that I've seen most of them in
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
boiler rooms but really in environments
 
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
that are both not appropriate not
 
02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:50.110 align:start position:0%
that are both not appropriate not
inclusive

02:37:50.110 --> 02:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
um it's our argument that we're seeing
 
02:37:53.910 --> 02:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
many of these as being more restrictive
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
than some of the further down the
 
02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
Continuum um separate special ed schools
 
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
because some of these students have no
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
peers and this is happening all too
 
02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
frequently and I think the effort being
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
made so even as this gets cleaned up I
 
02:38:12.750 --> 02:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure this does not get
 
02:38:15.070 --> 02:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
abandoned in terms of attention the
 
02:38:17.070 --> 02:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
effort that's being made I think by the
 
02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
department of Ed was to say to districts
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
look you know just because we've
 
02:38:25.309 --> 02:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
approved your whole special education
 
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
program and we've approved a
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
self-contained special ed class that you
 
02:38:31.389 --> 02:38:31.399 align:start position:0%
might have that doesn't mean we can
 
02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
suddenly take certain students and put
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
them in other things and say well this
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
is their separate
 
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
special self-contained class and this is
 
02:38:41.070 --> 02:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
that student special education
 
02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:42.590 align:start position:0%
that student special education
self-contained

02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
self-contained
 
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
class if we're doing that all of those
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
environments need to be approved and
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
more importantly because the word
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
environment can can become confusing
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
what it means by these definitions is
 
02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
that all the providers in those
 
02:38:57.309 --> 02:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
environments also need to be approved
 
02:39:00.429 --> 02:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
because that is where we are seeing all
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
too much time being spent with par
 
02:39:05.550 --> 02:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
Educators um especially designed
 
02:39:08.349 --> 02:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
instruction is in Your Service delivery
 
02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
Grid in the IEP and it has a provider
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
listed next to it and so there there are
 
02:39:16.830 --> 02:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
places to put the par Educators in those
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
Service delivery grids it would not be
 
02:39:20.910 --> 02:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
called specially designed instruction
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
the specially designed instruction in
 
02:39:24.429 --> 02:39:24.439 align:start position:0%
the number of minutes per week should be
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
provided by a special education teacher
 
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
and I agree with the effort if it if if
 
02:39:30.910 --> 02:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
we have lack of clarity in the Nessa
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
system such that we can select the wrong
 
02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
provider to provide specially design
 
02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
instruction we have to clean that up but
 
02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
we do need to give the department more
 
02:39:43.230 --> 02:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
Authority and us more ability to say to
 
02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
the department to raise an issue please
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
go look at where this child is being
 
02:39:48.750 --> 02:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
educated because this is coming up and I
 
02:39:51.269 --> 02:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
would tell you 20% of our cases we do
 
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
deal that doesn't mean it's happening in
 
02:39:54.750 --> 02:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
20% of the cases Statewide my office
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
deals with really more more egregious
 
02:39:59.230 --> 02:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
situations that have gone on for a long
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
time often higher needs but we want to
 
02:40:04.510 --> 02:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're giving them that um
 
02:40:06.990 --> 02:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
ability thank you any
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:10.870 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
representative

02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so would you
 
02:40:18.269 --> 02:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
support an interm study on this I would
 
02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
support an interm study and actually I
 
02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
do support most of what is in the
 
02:40:23.190 --> 02:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think the amendment
 
02:40:26.349 --> 02:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
does clarify some important things um
 
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
and and just to speak to that related
 
02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
Services um piece the idea Federal
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
definition of related Services is much
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
much broader than what was in the state
 
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
um piece it's actually quite good in the
 
02:40:45.230 --> 02:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
idea um and so by writing anything in
 
02:40:47.870 --> 02:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
our state that is definitional that
 
02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:49.429 align:start position:0%
our state that is definitional that
narrows

02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
narrows
 
02:40:51.870 --> 02:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
um we do a disservice right we we should
 
02:40:53.429 --> 02:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
not be writing any definitions that
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
narrow and unfortunately I don't think
 
02:40:56.990 --> 02:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's feasible in our legislation to
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
write in everything that is there in the
 
02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
idea so so I really do believe that the
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
intent was take out something that's
 
02:41:06.070 --> 02:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
much narrower because that actually that
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
definition had the potential if someone
 
02:41:10.349 --> 02:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
didn't fight it properly to limit not
 
02:41:12.910 --> 02:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
expand the rights of students thank you
 
02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
represent of Damon thank you madam
 
02:41:18.309 --> 02:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
chair could you please tell us
 
02:41:20.590 --> 02:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
approximately how many cases your office
 
02:41:23.469 --> 02:41:23.479 align:start position:0%
is currently involved in and if you have
 
02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
it roughly what portion of special ed
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
students across the state that
 
02:41:30.469 --> 02:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
is okay so we are always going to be
 
02:41:33.230 --> 02:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
involved in a tiny fraction of cases
 
02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
across the state um cases across the
 
02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
state for for IEPs to um exceed
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
30,000 um we have two full-time staff
 
02:41:43.990 --> 02:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
members myself and my colleague Tim
 
02:41:48.190 --> 02:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
Lenahan Hera here um last year we were
 
02:41:50.510 --> 02:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
very like in a year period um our first
 
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
year of operation we were very actively
 
02:41:55.349 --> 02:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
involved in 40 to 50 cases in terms of
 
02:41:56.910 --> 02:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
resolution most of the time it was just
 
02:41:59.550 --> 02:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
me at that point um right now we are
 
02:42:02.910 --> 02:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
getting inquiries that are you know not
 
02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
even just inquiries requests for
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
assistance that top about 40 a month we
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
are not coming close to be we simply
 
02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
just are so radically understaffed um I
 
02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
would say at any given time you know Tim
 
02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
and I are each actively handling
 
02:42:21.230 --> 02:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
probably about 10 cases in addition to
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
trying to weigh in on policy and um ra
 
02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
you know meet with doe and raise issues
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
systemic any other
 
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very

uh that is Kristen
 
03:36:35.790 --> 03:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
Advocate good afternoon yes Kristen
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
monani here with the office of the
 
03:36:42.070 --> 03:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
special education Advocate thank you all
 
03:36:44.790 --> 03:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
for giving me the opportunity to testify
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
on this
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh we the office supports a version of
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
automatic discovery that I do want to
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
talk about um here today we don't
 
03:36:57.189 --> 03:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
support this bill as it's written and I
 
03:37:00.910 --> 03:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
will tell you why um we have submitted
 
03:37:05.189 --> 03:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
to the prime sponsor um what our
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
proposed language would be for a redraft
 
03:37:12.189 --> 03:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
of this so to define the term Discovery
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
I think those of you who are lawyers
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
understand it but otherwise it's kind of
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
a gene general term
 
03:37:21.910 --> 03:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
um when we're in the process of dispute
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
resolution and so so this in some
 
03:37:26.469 --> 03:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
respects can address a finding of the
 
03:37:28.910 --> 03:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
special education dispute resolution
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
audit which really called for efforts to
 
03:37:34.950 --> 03:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
make the process more open to parents
 
03:37:37.910 --> 03:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
pray a lot of parents came forth during
 
03:37:40.590 --> 03:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
that audit conduct and said we're paying
 
03:37:42.510 --> 03:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 10,000 to
 
03:37:46.469 --> 03:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
60,000 fees to advocates or attorneys to
 
03:37:48.910 --> 03:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
even bring our cases to some kind of
 
03:37:52.110 --> 03:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
resolution so you know that shouldn't be
 
03:37:54.870 --> 03:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
the case because really in terms of
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
accountability for our special ed
 
03:37:59.309 --> 03:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
dollars and for outcomes um parents
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
should be able to bring uh situations to
 
03:38:05.189 --> 03:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
resolution when they don't believe the
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
services are accomplishing what they
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
need which is making adequate progress
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
for a student
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
so um a version of so-called discovery
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
which is the process by which all the
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
documents get produced that support um
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
or oppose a position taken in a case um
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
there there are a lot of rules around
 
03:38:29.950 --> 03:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
that production of documents sometimes
 
03:38:31.750 --> 03:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
there are motions for against the
 
03:38:33.590 --> 03:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
production of documents they it gets
 
03:38:35.110 --> 03:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
argued out before the hearing officers
 
03:38:37.750 --> 03:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
but the whole um kitten Kaboodle of
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
producing documents is is the Discovery
 
03:38:42.750 --> 03:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
um what we what my office has found in
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
working with parents over the past year
 
03:38:46.110 --> 03:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
and a half and we have
 
03:38:47.630 --> 03:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
had occasion to be in due process
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
hearings on a number of times is that um
 
03:38:55.229 --> 03:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes the points really get lost in
 
03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of pages of
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
documents that are being produced it's
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
overwhelming for a parent pray um if the
 
03:39:05.870 --> 03:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
parent hires an advocate or attorney
 
03:39:07.870 --> 03:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
because it's not a case that our office
 
03:39:10.189 --> 03:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
could take and and we are working in
 
03:39:12.630 --> 03:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
only the tiniest fraction of the cases
 
03:39:15.630 --> 03:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
that come up um you know that is just
 
03:39:17.550 --> 03:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
time time for our hearing officers time
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
for the parents to go through these
 
03:39:21.030 --> 03:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of pages and
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
really special education
 
03:39:25.630 --> 03:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
disputes if we're looking for
 
03:39:27.870 --> 03:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency should
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
boil down
 
03:39:33.269 --> 03:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
to progress reports
 
03:39:35.710 --> 03:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
evaluations and something called the
 
03:39:37.349 --> 03:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
written prior notices which is the
 
03:39:39.790 --> 03:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
document by which a parent might have
 
03:39:43.469 --> 03:39:43.479 align:start position:0%
said I'm requesting X and the school
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
district says yes or no and gives their
 
03:39:48.349 --> 03:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
reasons why it's a required document
 
03:39:49.710 --> 03:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
there's a written prior notice we
 
03:39:51.910 --> 03:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that you've requested this
 
03:39:53.670 --> 03:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
and we're saying yes or we're saying no
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we're basing our answer on the
 
03:39:57.990 --> 03:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
following these evaluations these
 
03:40:00.990 --> 03:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
progress reports Etc so our office would
 
03:40:05.269 --> 03:40:05.279 align:start position:0%
would very very um heavily support a
 
03:40:06.830 --> 03:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
said yes every case that comes
 
03:40:12.429 --> 03:40:12.439 align:start position:0%
up there is an automatic Discovery
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
before the first conference with before
 
03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
the prehearing conference confence which
 
03:40:17.070 --> 03:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
is the first time that the parents get
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
in front of the hearing officer or both
 
03:40:19.590 --> 03:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
parties get in front of the hearing
 
03:40:21.870 --> 03:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
officer most of the time and what gets
 
03:40:24.790 --> 03:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
produced by the district is just what's
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the enumerated list here my issue
 
03:40:28.870 --> 03:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
with the bill the reason we're not
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
supporting it is because the paragraph
 
03:40:33.550 --> 03:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
before the enumerated list under sorry
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
let me turn my
 
03:40:35.640 --> 03:40:37.269 align:start position:0%
let me turn my
um

03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:39.550 --> 03:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's numbered a bit wrong here I
 
03:40:43.349 --> 03:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
think in the bill but three R num
 
03:40:46.590 --> 03:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
3-b we're not supporting what's in that
 
03:40:48.429 --> 03:40:48.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph a there because it allows for
 
03:40:50.469 --> 03:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
the same dump of data that I'm talking
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
about that can really obscure issues and
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of pages we are
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
supporting the idea that what's listed
 
03:41:04.189 --> 03:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
in this um B such discoverable items and
 
03:41:06.790 --> 03:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
information are I would strike the shall
 
03:41:09.550 --> 03:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
include but not be limited to um and
 
03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
then a list of pieces because those
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
would make the process of dispute
 
03:41:16.510 --> 03:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
resolution far far more accessible to
 
03:41:17.710 --> 03:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
the parents it would actually let the
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
hearing officers know what the case is
 
03:41:20.910 --> 03:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
about for the most part here if the
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
hearing officer gets several thousand
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
Pages they say to the parties you tell
 
03:41:27.389 --> 03:41:27.399 align:start position:0%
me what to focus on I'm not reading
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
through all these several thousand Pages
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
um so it puts actually a procedural
 
03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
burden on the parent during the hearing
 
03:41:36.510 --> 03:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
to know how to reference the documents
 
03:41:38.070 --> 03:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
virtually and have a witness who brings
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
them in ETC it creates a lot of Burden
 
03:41:44.670 --> 03:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
um and it just does not allow for the
 
03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
really clear issues to come forward um
 
03:41:48.269 --> 03:41:48.279 align:start position:0%
to give some examples I had a couple
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
cases um in the past few months where we
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
had sort of had to prove a negative we
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
had to prove that on the parents behalf
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
that there weren't progress reports it
 
03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
sounds easy except that in thousands and
 
03:42:05.110 --> 03:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages of documents that
 
03:42:05.120 --> 03:42:05.950 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages of documents that
were

03:42:05.950 --> 03:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:42:08.590 --> 03:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
produced we were in a position after
 
03:42:10.830 --> 03:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
endless hours of hearing of saying to a
 
03:42:10.840 --> 03:42:12.389 align:start position:0%
endless hours of hearing of saying to a
witness

03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
witness
 
03:42:14.910 --> 03:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
well where where is your evidence of
 
03:42:14.920 --> 03:42:15.790 align:start position:0%
well where where is your evidence of
problem

03:42:15.790 --> 03:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
ress point us to the progress reports
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
well I'm sure they're in here I mean I
 
03:42:22.189 --> 03:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
do you want me to say I I I can't I mean
 
03:42:23.469 --> 03:42:23.479 align:start position:0%
sitting in the hearing go through the
 
03:42:25.670 --> 03:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages and I sort of made
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
the point but I'm not allowed to testify
 
03:42:30.750 --> 03:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
as an advocate I have gone through them
 
03:42:32.830 --> 03:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
are you certain you know can you point
 
03:42:34.429 --> 03:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
us to the pages well not right now but
 
03:42:36.510 --> 03:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they're there so it's a very
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
odd position of having to kind of prove
 
03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
a negative that they're not there in the
 
03:42:42.189 --> 03:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
many thousands of pages when these cases
 
03:42:44.710 --> 03:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
should be simpler and and it would hold
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
District accountable for Progress if
 
03:42:49.710 --> 03:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
every single time a parent filed a
 
03:42:52.149 --> 03:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
complaint The Next Step that happened
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
was great produce the last three years
 
03:42:58.189 --> 03:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
of progress reports evaluations and your
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
written prior notices where you said
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
whether you were granting or denying a
 
03:43:05.070 --> 03:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
parent request and on what basis and
 
03:43:06.670 --> 03:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
that's it don't produce any more than
 
03:43:08.950 --> 03:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
that just produce that to the hearing
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
officer so that he or she can digest it
 
03:43:12.670 --> 03:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
and and there can be active management
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
of the case and a hearing officer or
 
03:43:18.790 --> 03:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
even a school district um representative
 
03:43:20.269 --> 03:43:20.279 align:start position:0%
who's just taken over a case which
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
happens many many times can themselves
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
say let me look at this before I
 
03:43:27.389 --> 03:43:27.399 align:start position:0%
continue to prosecute this case let me
 
03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
look at whether I do actually have these
 
03:43:32.590 --> 03:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
basic simple documents that should be
 
03:43:34.389 --> 03:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
the accountability piece so we do
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
support a version of this bill and half
 
03:43:38.550 --> 03:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
provided language that amends what's
 
03:43:41.110 --> 03:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
here what's here I fear would just
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
require something that I think is
 
03:43:44.550 --> 03:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
actually a negative which is a huge dump
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
of information
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
because it's saying give us everything
 
03:43:50.149 --> 03:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
that shows the appropriateness of the
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
placement and it would include these
 
03:43:53.309 --> 03:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
documents but not be limited to them I
 
03:43:55.630 --> 03:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
think that less is more and actually
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
requiring the more is a disadvantage but
 
03:43:59.830 --> 03:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
some version of automatic Discovery
 
03:44:02.269 --> 03:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
would be a huge huge change in our
 
03:44:04.189 --> 03:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
processes and very beneficial to Pro
 
03:44:08.349 --> 03:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
parents thank you represent Murray thank
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
03:44:12.389 --> 03:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
question so when you're talking about
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
prosay parents that means they're
 
03:44:16.189 --> 03:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
obviously representing themselves yes um
 
03:44:17.790 --> 03:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
so you're using that definition but
 
03:44:19.710 --> 03:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
you're not using the definition of
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
Discovery in the traditional legal sense
 
03:44:23.790 --> 03:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
that it is open to a broad swath of
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
things you're wanting a more narrow
 
03:44:28.550 --> 03:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
scope defined by those progress reports
 
03:44:31.830 --> 03:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
what are the other two um so so it is
 
03:44:36.269 --> 03:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
what's written here um it's it's number
 
03:44:38.070 --> 03:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
one would only apply in certain cases so
 
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
in our redrafted Amendment we say only
 
03:44:42.030 --> 03:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
when the eligibility is that issue in
 
03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
the first place um but it's the IEP
 
03:44:46.229 --> 03:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
drafts that the written prior
 
03:44:46.239 --> 03:44:47.950 align:start position:0%
drafts that the written prior
notices

03:44:47.950 --> 03:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
notices
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
um we rewrote it as evaluations and
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
progress reports um to your point no uh
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
and and in the language we've proposed
 
03:45:01.469 --> 03:45:01.479 align:start position:0%
we do say you know it would be
 
03:45:02.870 --> 03:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for this legislature to
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
try to limit the discovery that's
 
03:45:08.750 --> 03:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
permissible above and beyond what we've
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
termed core documents that would still
 
03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
be permissible for either party to
 
03:45:16.510 --> 03:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
provide um saying we need to supplement
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
to make our Point these basic core
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
documents but what we would like to see
 
03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
is that as soon as you know the first
 
03:45:26.990 --> 03:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
step in a hearing happens those
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
documents that parents may have received
 
03:45:30.349 --> 03:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
at some point in 3 years probably
 
03:45:31.870 --> 03:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
electronically a lot of parents don't
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
even realize the importance of the
 
03:45:36.149 --> 03:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
written prior notices um from a legal
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
sense that these documents would be
 
03:45:40.670 --> 03:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
would come up in a very standardized
 
03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
packet that every hearing officer knew I
 
03:45:46.030 --> 03:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
can look for the wpns par notice the
 
03:45:48.269 --> 03:45:48.279 align:start position:0%
progress of reports the
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
evaluations and get a sense of this case
 
03:45:53.910 --> 03:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
and then additional Discovery um you
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
know is provided under the rules and
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
very much delineated and it would it
 
03:45:58.870 --> 03:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
would have to continue to be allowed
 
03:46:01.469 --> 03:46:01.479 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to okay rewrite
 
03:46:04.309 --> 03:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
that representative Hall thank you Mr
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:46:07.149 --> 03:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
question so where is the language that
 
03:46:10.269 --> 03:46:10.279 align:start position:0%
you proposed um we we did submit it to
 
03:46:11.950 --> 03:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy and I can
 
03:46:13.950 --> 03:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
circulate it to this full committee or
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
or to the chair and ask that he
 
03:46:18.469 --> 03:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
circulated thank
 
03:46:22.389 --> 03:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
you representative Damon yes thank you
 
03:46:24.269 --> 03:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks for taking my question
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
yeah in the vein of you if you don't
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
know you should ask what is a written
 
03:46:30.429 --> 03:46:30.439 align:start position:0%
prior notice I get the written part sure
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
so every single time that a parent
 
03:46:36.030 --> 03:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
requests or that a school district
 
03:46:39.269 --> 03:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
proposes to make um a substantive change
 
03:46:41.189 --> 03:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
and and and that's further defined but
 
03:46:43.710 --> 03:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
essentially something that changes the
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
placement of a child services that a
 
03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
child is receiving under special
 
03:46:50.830 --> 03:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
education um The District's required not
 
03:46:54.070 --> 03:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
only to kind of hold the meeting and
 
03:46:57.070 --> 03:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
discuss that but actually put in
 
03:46:59.830 --> 03:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
writing the proposal whether it came
 
03:47:02.349 --> 03:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
from the parent or the district if it
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
came from the parent whether they're
 
03:47:06.790 --> 03:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
agreeing to or denying that
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
proposal and the basis so usually it's
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
it's pretty streamlined it would say
 
03:47:15.070 --> 03:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
parent requests
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
specially designed instruction in
 
03:47:23.070 --> 03:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
writing District refuses to provide that
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
because on the basis of the progress
 
03:47:28.189 --> 03:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
reports Etc or this evaluation we don't
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
think it's needed a big one that comes
 
03:47:32.229 --> 03:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
up more substantial than one specific
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
service parent requests an
 
03:47:37.550 --> 03:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
outplacement District refuses on the
 
03:47:39.389 --> 03:47:39.399 align:start position:0%
basis that the student is making
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
adequate progress as demonstrated by the
 
03:47:41.359 --> 03:47:42.229 align:start position:0%
adequate progress as demonstrated by the
progress

03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
progress
 
03:47:45.189 --> 03:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
reports so again we're just saying okay
 
03:47:46.870 --> 03:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
this is a legal document this is really
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
where a case should be based we should
 
03:47:51.030 --> 03:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
not have cases going to
 
03:47:53.870 --> 03:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
hearings unless something specific has
 
03:47:56.910 --> 03:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
been requested has been denied with a
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
basis expressed which is what the
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
written prior notice is required to do
 
03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:03.479 align:start position:0%
um for that denial and and that denial
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
basis usually can be find found in
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
progress reports or
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
evaluations what what it's important to
 
03:48:13.830 --> 03:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
understand is that these are these are
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
very legal documents often receive them
 
03:48:17.550 --> 03:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
alongside they receive this written
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
prior notice and you almost kind of
 
03:48:21.550 --> 03:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
brush it aside because it's received
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
alongside a very large packet of IEP
 
03:48:28.110 --> 03:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
documents sometimes um making amendments
 
03:48:31.309 --> 03:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
Etc uh its significance is sometimes
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
overlooked and it is hard for parents
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
because they are receiving tons and tons
 
03:48:38.670 --> 03:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
and tons of documentation to really have
 
03:48:40.389 --> 03:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
a good case File they don't think when
 
03:48:42.149 --> 03:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
they're having these discussions back
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
and forth with their school district
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
that they're eventually going to end up
 
03:48:46.990 --> 03:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
in a he ing on these pieces so parents
 
03:48:49.030 --> 03:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
have not always retained them the school
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
districts are required to in the files
 
03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
we're just asking automatically produce
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
a case File that is streamlined that the
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
hearing officer knows to look for these
 
03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
items every time and it will make it
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
very obvious if they're not there parent
 
03:49:04.990 --> 03:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
won't be in a position of proving that
 
03:49:07.110 --> 03:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
the needle is not in the Hy stack there
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
are no progress reports in these
 
03:49:10.750 --> 03:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages for this whole year
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
instead the hearing officer would have
 
03:49:14.429 --> 03:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
seen that day one where where are my
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
progress reports I don't have any
 
03:49:19.149 --> 03:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
on representative Woodcock thank you
 
03:49:24.510 --> 03:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
chair good afternoon hope you enjoyed
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
the Quick Lunch um here's a question for
 
03:49:28.389 --> 03:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
you said that you provided additional I
 
03:49:29.469 --> 03:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
think somebody brought up additional
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
language to represent Murphy is that so
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
the language here is not from your
 
03:49:36.389 --> 03:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
department no it's not okay may fault
 
03:49:39.110 --> 03:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so the so that information is
 
03:49:40.309 --> 03:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
that going to come as an amendment are
 
03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
you Distributing to the whole committee
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
or we're not going to see it all right I
 
03:49:45.910 --> 03:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
will I oh you have it oh I'm sorry yeah
 
03:49:47.870 --> 03:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's not in the form of amendment yet
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I apologize thank
 
03:49:53.870 --> 03:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
03:49:56.110 --> 03:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:49:59.550 --> 03:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us so
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to play a little bit of I'm
 
03:50:03.389 --> 03:50:03.399 align:start position:0%
going to ask you a question if you don't
 
03:50:05.349 --> 03:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
mind would you not agree that obtaining
 
03:50:07.349 --> 03:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
all of the stated information should be
 
03:50:08.830 --> 03:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
left up to the
 
03:50:12.349 --> 03:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
parents I I understand exactly as as a
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
parent of a child on the Spectrum for 12
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
years I went through every IEP process
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
there was twice du process so I
 
03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but I'm at
 
03:50:23.670 --> 03:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
an advantage I'm an occupational
 
03:50:25.309 --> 03:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
therapist so I know how to read those
 
03:50:27.750 --> 03:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
documents but shouldn't we leave that
 
03:50:29.790 --> 03:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
decision up to the
 
03:50:32.590 --> 03:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
parents I just want to clarify the the
 
03:50:36.149 --> 03:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
decision question so I think
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
that parents are still free and in the
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
language we've proposed we are explicit
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
in saying none of what we're talking
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
about that should be produced as a set
 
03:50:49.630 --> 03:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
of core documents to the hearing officer
 
03:50:53.070 --> 03:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
up front limits in any way the right of
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
either party to voluntarily submit
 
03:50:56.429 --> 03:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
additional or to request additional
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
Discovery thank you followup and I think
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's what's missing is the new
 
03:51:01.830 --> 03:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
language but I thank you for the answer
 
03:51:04.630 --> 03:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
Cornell so what you're proposing would
 
03:51:09.550 --> 03:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
stream like streamline this and make it
 
03:51:13.870 --> 03:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
easier and the um fiscal note says that
 
03:51:15.910 --> 03:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
um it's determin will be because you
 
03:51:17.349 --> 03:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
can't tell how many actions will be
 
03:51:19.389 --> 03:51:19.399 align:start position:0%
taken but it probably would be less if
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
parents got this and could understand
 
03:51:25.110 --> 03:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
more easily what what they needed what
 
03:51:27.389 --> 03:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
was going on what they were being given
 
03:51:29.149 --> 03:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
you know I'm having flashbacks to the
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
last bill which was so confusing that I
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody at by the end of the
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
hearing knew what was going on so this
 
03:51:39.309 --> 03:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
seems like what you want to do and your
 
03:51:40.910 --> 03:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment would make it easier for
 
03:51:43.070 --> 03:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
everybody yes that is that is always the
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
intention with the idea that more
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
transparency leads to more accurate
 
03:51:51.950 --> 03:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
outcomes in terms of the fiscal impact I
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
would say that merely requiring a set of
 
03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
core documents to be produced that are
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
already definitively required to be in
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
the school district's files and if
 
03:52:00.950 --> 03:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're not there it means they don't
 
03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
exist often they don't exist that's part
 
03:52:07.149 --> 03:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
of the problem um not often but but at
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
times when we're going to hearing but
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
there should be no fiscal impact to just
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
requiring a quick let me pull these and
 
03:52:16.110 --> 03:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
submit them electronically from the
 
03:52:19.830 --> 03:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
files it should cut down on the cost of
 
03:52:22.990 --> 03:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
some hearings um for for the even the
 
03:52:26.429 --> 03:52:26.439 align:start position:0%
hearing officer's time thank you
 
03:52:29.030 --> 03:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
represent Bon oh thank you Mr chair
 
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so
 
03:52:33.269 --> 03:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
you said that this language and or this
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill didn't come from your office um I
 
03:52:38.110 --> 03:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
know that the prime sponsor isn't here
 
03:52:39.469 --> 03:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
but do you
 
03:52:44.269 --> 03:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
know um why this bill is necessary from
 
03:52:48.389 --> 03:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor's position and um why
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
this specific language uh and where it
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
came from as is right now I do know um
 
03:52:57.229 --> 03:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
it was the outgrowth of a conversation
 
03:52:59.870 --> 03:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
that my office was involved in about the
 
03:53:02.469 --> 03:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
the process of hearings and we did
 
03:53:05.149 --> 03:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
suggest that there should be sort of a
 
03:53:07.309 --> 03:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
hearing packet that was automatically
 
03:53:09.750 --> 03:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
provided on the basis of our experience
 
03:53:11.349 --> 03:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
doing some of these hearings and not
 
03:53:15.910 --> 03:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
having that information with Clarity um
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
but we were sort of explicit that it
 
03:53:19.950 --> 03:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
should not go
 
03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
beyond this core set of documents that
 
03:53:24.309 --> 03:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
was required because it would sort of
 
03:53:27.469 --> 03:53:27.479 align:start position:0%
defeat the purpose we did not draft the
 
03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
language um it is why as I've said we've
 
03:53:31.950 --> 03:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
kind of wait in to
 
03:53:35.189 --> 03:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
say the language came from from parents
 
03:53:37.510 --> 03:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
who who sometimes been strong Advocates
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
but um you
 
03:53:43.990 --> 03:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
know we as I said we've provided our
 
03:53:47.229 --> 03:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
take on an amendment just quick followup
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
um so these you you what you have said
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
is this information is often times in
 
03:53:56.469 --> 03:53:56.479 align:start position:0%
already included in the file um that is
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
that the school district has to send to
 
03:54:00.149 --> 03:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
the parent anyway when when they get to
 
03:54:04.429 --> 03:54:04.439 align:start position:0%
this stage because you refer to a a data
 
03:54:08.269 --> 03:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
dump um so I'm assuming that part of the
 
03:54:11.429 --> 03:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
problem from your your the way you're
 
03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
describing it is that what here officers
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
need are these specific informations but
 
03:54:18.429 --> 03:54:18.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to dig through the
 
03:54:21.910 --> 03:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
whole file to get at them is is that a
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
correct assumption it's it's largely
 
03:54:26.950 --> 03:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
accurate I would just um provide one
 
03:54:29.550 --> 03:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
clarification um at the time of a
 
03:54:31.469 --> 03:54:31.479 align:start position:0%
hearing these documents are not
 
03:54:32.870 --> 03:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily sent to the parent these
 
03:54:33.910 --> 03:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
documents might have been sent to the
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
parent over the course of a few years
 
03:54:38.830 --> 03:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
prior and they should be in the school
 
03:54:40.349 --> 03:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
district's files the school district is
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
nowhere required to turn over its entire
 
03:54:44.349 --> 03:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
file the only thing the district is requ
 
03:54:46.229 --> 03:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
ired to provide is what they feel would
 
03:54:48.990 --> 03:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
support their case and anything that a
 
03:54:51.750 --> 03:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
parent knows to draft a discovery
 
03:54:53.269 --> 03:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
request or in the hearing to
 
03:54:55.389 --> 03:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
specifically ask for that's actually a
 
03:54:57.630 --> 03:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
tall order for a parent because though
 
03:54:59.110 --> 03:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
they know they could ask for documents
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
they're like in what form how do I how
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
do I ask for the right things um many
 
03:55:04.469 --> 03:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
parents we deal with would not even
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily know they they wouldn't know
 
03:55:08.189 --> 03:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
to ask for a written prior notice
 
03:55:09.389 --> 03:55:09.399 align:start position:0%
whereas I think that's one of the most
 
03:55:11.149 --> 03:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
important documents because it has to
 
03:55:11.159 --> 03:55:12.429 align:start position:0%
important documents because it has to
succinctly

03:55:12.429 --> 03:55:12.439 align:start position:0%
succinctly
 
03:55:15.070 --> 03:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
summarize here's we we acknowledge
 
03:55:17.790 --> 03:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
getting this request here's how we acted
 
03:55:20.229 --> 03:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
on it and here's why and that kind of
 
03:55:23.110 --> 03:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
gives you your road map to dive into the
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
wise and what the data was to support it
 
03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
um so the at no point in a hearing is
 
03:55:32.870 --> 03:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
anyone required to turn over right now
 
03:55:34.630 --> 03:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
these specific documents and we think
 
03:55:37.510 --> 03:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
that would be a very helpful step in the
 
03:55:40.670 --> 03:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
process repr Murray thank you Mr chair
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question one
 
03:55:45.389 --> 03:55:45.399 align:start position:0%
question I do have is how this process
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
would potentially stand in support of or
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
91a

03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
91a
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
um so I would tell you once you're in a
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
hearing setting 91a becomes less
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
relevant because it really is going to
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
be the discovery process and the rules
 
03:56:08.149 --> 03:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
that are kind of laid out for Discovery
 
03:56:11.269 --> 03:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
um rarely would one of our parties in a
 
03:56:13.389 --> 03:56:13.399 align:start position:0%
in a in the course of a hearing need to
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
do a 91a request because they can do a
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
so-called voluntary Discovery or
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
production of documents request and it
 
03:56:24.910 --> 03:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
is presumed that unless a good reason is
 
03:56:26.790 --> 03:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
Advanced and the hearing officer
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
rules that documents don't have to be
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
produced by either party that there is
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
an obligation to produce whatever's been
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
asked for the problem is the onus is on
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
the parent to know exactly what to ask
 
03:56:39.510 --> 03:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
for and to draft these essentially legal
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
motions and then argue for why they need
 
03:56:45.429 --> 03:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
those documents if someone objects so um
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
it it substantively what you get might
 
03:56:49.990 --> 03:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
not be so different from a 91a request
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
but it would in a hearing process be
 
03:56:55.030 --> 03:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
done under the discovery
 
03:56:58.710 --> 03:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
rules R WC thank you well last question
 
03:57:01.750 --> 03:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
I know he like give me two if what I'm
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
hearing is assuming that we don't have
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
any other language and assuming that
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
you're the advoc advocate for the
 
03:57:10.110 --> 03:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
parents why isn't your office just can't
 
03:57:12.110 --> 03:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
prepare a simple little request you for
 
03:57:13.790 --> 03:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
the parents to say these are the things
 
03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
you should ask
 
03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
for we can um and we are talking about
 
03:57:21.309 --> 03:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
doing that and actually that is um to
 
03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bon's prior question uh
 
03:57:27.670 --> 03:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
this discussion came up within a broader
 
03:57:30.309 --> 03:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
discussion of what are the things that
 
03:57:32.910 --> 03:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
we can do right now to simplify and to
 
03:57:35.830 --> 03:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
assist parents for in a formulaic way
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
with pursuing their cases um again onus
 
03:57:42.750 --> 03:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
is still on the
 
03:57:47.189 --> 03:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
parent to to actually ask for that um
 
03:57:49.710 --> 03:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
fill out that form and and we could
 
03:57:49.720 --> 03:57:52.469 align:start position:0%
fill out that form and and we could
not

03:57:52.469 --> 03:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:57:56.349 --> 03:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
um we think there's a benefit both both
 
03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the clarification of the issues
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
whether it ends up benefiting parent or
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
District in the end but we also think it
 
03:58:03.630 --> 03:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
would help our hearing officers to
 
03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
better manage the cases and to have a
 
03:58:09.750 --> 03:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
clear picture from day one about what
 
03:58:11.790 --> 03:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
the issues are that they're weighing in
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
on so we didn't didn't want to put this
 
03:58:17.309 --> 03:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily just on as the burden of the
 
03:58:19.550 --> 03:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
parent we certainly can do that and and
 
03:58:21.309 --> 03:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
would in the absence of this legislation
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
draft that sample form thank you thank
 
03:58:26.750 --> 03:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
you chairman see no further questions
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being
 
03:58:32.550 --> 03:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
here um and uh there's no one else who
 
03:58:36.429 --> 03:58:36.439 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on
 
03:58:39.469 --> 03:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
754 we'll close that hearing and move on
 
03:58:43.469 --> 03:58:43.479 align:start position:0%
to um House Bill 753 relative to
 
03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
expedited do process hearings to enforce
 
03:58:47.870 --> 03:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
special education
 
03:58:51.389 --> 03:58:51.399 align:start position:0%
rights and since um he did an such an
 
03:58:53.550 --> 03:58:53.560 align:start position:0%
outstanding job and introducing the
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
previous bill um I will ask uh
 
03:58:59.269 --> 03:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
representa Terry to introduce this bill
 
03:58:59.279 --> 03:59:02.389 align:start position:0%
representa Terry to introduce this bill
as

03:59:02.389 --> 03:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.950 --> 03:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:12.070 --> 03:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
questions you might receive some very
 
03:59:14.189 --> 03:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
interesting answers
 
03:59:16.469 --> 03:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
responses I should
 
03:59:20.469 --> 03:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
say Thank you Mr chairman I am here to
 
03:59:24.349 --> 03:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
introduce uh HB 753 FN relative to
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
expedited due process hearings to
 
03:59:28.710 --> 03:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
enforce special education rights and I'm
 
03:59:31.349 --> 03:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
doing so in the absence of the sponsor
 
03:59:33.750 --> 03:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
or any co-sponsors and I would prefer
 
03:59:36.110 --> 03:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
not to take any questions for fear that
 
03:59:38.149 --> 03:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
the information I provide may not be of
 
03:59:41.070 --> 03:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
help to the committee thank
 
03:59:44.189 --> 03:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
you and and we'll remember that for uh
 
03:59:46.830 --> 03:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
future hearings as well I appreciate
 
03:59:50.429 --> 03:59:50.439 align:start position:0%
that thank you I hope to be back
 
03:59:53.189 --> 03:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
sometime thank you
 
04:00:08.910 --> 04:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.189 --> 04:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
tunham my name is Bonnie Dunham and I
 
04:00:12.910 --> 04:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
live in marac New Hampshire I'm here as
 
04:00:16.110 --> 04:00:16.120 align:start position:0%
a regular person um just as private
 
04:00:18.389 --> 04:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
citizen um and I'm asking you to please
 
04:00:21.269 --> 04:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
support this bill it's to ensure that an
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
expedited do process hearing can't take
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
longer than a regular due process
 
04:00:26.990 --> 04:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
hearing there are two types of due
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
process hearings a regular one and an
 
04:00:31.309 --> 04:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
expedited one and you might think given
 
04:00:33.630 --> 04:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
the definition of the word expedited
 
04:00:35.910 --> 04:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
that it would mean it would be faster
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
but that's not necessarily true a
 
04:00:40.149 --> 04:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
regular due process hearing is a
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
procedure that parents in schools can
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
use to resolve a dispute on anything
 
04:00:46.149 --> 04:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
having to do with identification
 
04:00:48.590 --> 04:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation placement or the provision of
 
04:00:50.349 --> 04:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
a free appropriate public education for
 
04:00:54.070 --> 04:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
a child it must be completed and the
 
04:00:56.990 --> 04:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
decision mailed to the parties within 45
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
calendar days the caveat is that if a
 
04:01:02.149 --> 04:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
parent files for that to process hearing
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
there's an additional um 30-day
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
resolution period before the 45-day
 
04:01:09.309 --> 04:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
clock starts ticking and that's intended
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
to give the school one more chance to
 
04:01:12.670 --> 04:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
try to solve it um to the parent
 
04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
satisfaction so so maximum 30 to 40 30
 
04:01:20.830 --> 04:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
um it would be 45 45 plus 30 75 days if
 
04:01:22.389 --> 04:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
the parent in the school district decide
 
04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
to wave the um the resolution session it
 
04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
would be 45 calendar days but for
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
discipline related issues including when
 
04:01:31.870 --> 04:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
a parent disagrees with the decision to
 
04:01:34.670 --> 04:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
remove a child for Behavioral issues or
 
04:01:36.750 --> 04:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
when they disagree with whether the um
 
04:01:38.910 --> 04:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
the behavior was the result of the
 
04:01:40.710 --> 04:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
child's disability or the result of the
 
04:01:43.189 --> 04:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
school district's failure to implement
 
04:01:45.070 --> 04:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
the IEP it's called the manifestation
 
04:01:45.080 --> 04:01:46.469 align:start position:0%
the IEP it's called the manifestation
determination

04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
determination
 
04:01:48.830 --> 04:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
meeting um or when a school district
 
04:01:50.910 --> 04:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
asks a hearing officer to remove a child
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
from their current placement because
 
04:01:53.950 --> 04:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
they believe that maintaining them in
 
04:01:56.070 --> 04:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
that placement is substantially likely
 
04:01:58.189 --> 04:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
to result in injury to the others the
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
hearing must be expedited the timeline
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
for an expedited due process hearing is
 
04:02:05.590 --> 04:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
20 school days um for the hearing to be
 
04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
held plus 10 more school days for the
 
04:02:10.389 --> 04:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
hearing officer to render a decision
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
there's also a 15-day resolution session
 
04:02:14.149 --> 04:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
that would start periods that would
 
04:02:16.510 --> 04:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
start before that clock starts ticking
 
04:02:18.149 --> 04:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
unless the parent in the school district
 
04:02:20.790 --> 04:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
decided to wave it so that would be 30
 
04:02:24.149 --> 04:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
school days plus 15 school days I
 
04:02:26.349 --> 04:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
managed to find um the Manchester School
 
04:02:28.349 --> 04:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
District's calendar for last year and
 
04:02:30.149 --> 04:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
this year last year's was hard but I
 
04:02:33.389 --> 04:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
found it um to give an example so if you
 
04:02:35.349 --> 04:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
lived in Manchester and a request for a
 
04:02:36.990 --> 04:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
regular old due process hearing was
 
04:02:39.550 --> 04:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
filed on June 3rd of last year the
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
hearing would be completed in a decision
 
04:02:44.189 --> 04:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
given by July 18th if the was no
 
04:02:46.590 --> 04:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
resolution session and even with that it
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
would be completed by August 16th that's
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
10 and 1 12 weeks after the hearing
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
request was filed but still in time for
 
04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
everything to be resolved before you go
 
04:02:57.750 --> 04:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
back to school but if on that June 3rd
 
04:03:00.269 --> 04:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
of last year an expedited du process
 
04:03:02.950 --> 04:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
hearing was requested then the decision
 
04:03:05.950 --> 04:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be rendered until October 2nd
 
04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
if there was no resolution session and
 
04:03:10.830 --> 04:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
October 17th if that resolution period
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
was used 19 1 12 weeks after the request
 
04:03:16.349 --> 04:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
was filed that means that an expedited
 
04:03:18.149 --> 04:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
due process hearing would take between 9
 
04:03:21.070 --> 04:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
and 11 weeks longer than a regular due
 
04:03:24.149 --> 04:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
process hearing so you might ask I asked
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
um why wouldn't the parent in school
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
district just file for a regular due
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
process hearing and it's because they
 
04:03:31.149 --> 04:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed to if it's for a
 
04:03:32.750 --> 04:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
discipline issue they must file for an
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
expedite to due process hearing and
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
there are letters put out by the office
 
04:03:37.830 --> 04:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
of special education programs that
 
04:03:39.990 --> 04:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that yes indeed that means even
 
04:03:41.950 --> 04:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
if it takes longer
 
04:03:44.469 --> 04:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
um this bill meets the requirement in
 
04:03:46.710 --> 04:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
idea that an expedited due process
 
04:03:49.070 --> 04:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
hearing must occur within 20 school days
 
04:03:50.910 --> 04:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
and a decision made within 10 school
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
days after the hearing is filed because
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
in instances like if it happens over the
 
04:03:59.070 --> 04:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
summer um 45 calendar days is within 20
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
school days and so it's it's addressing
 
04:04:04.750 --> 04:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
both um plus those 10 school days so
 
04:04:06.349 --> 04:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
this bill would only apply in those
 
04:04:08.710 --> 04:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
really rare instances when the issue is
 
04:04:10.229 --> 04:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
a discipline issue and that's why the
 
04:04:12.590 --> 04:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
hearing was filed and it happens to be
 
04:04:15.630 --> 04:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
at the time of year when when having the
 
04:04:17.229 --> 04:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
hearing expedited would mean that it
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
takes longer much much longer in some
 
04:04:23.070 --> 04:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
cases than a regular due process hearing
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's just not reasonable we all know
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
what expedited means so I would like to
 
04:04:28.750 --> 04:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
ask you to please recommend this ought
 
04:04:30.750 --> 04:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
to pass to ensure that expedited means
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
that the hearing will be faster or at
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
least not longer than a regular due
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
process hearing and I'm happy to take
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
questions I've given you like probably a
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
page full of footnotes in your in the
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
written testimony so that you can find
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
any extra information that you're
 
04:04:44.800 --> 04:04:45.750 align:start position:0%
any extra information that you're
looking

04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
looking
 
04:04:50.590 --> 04:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:53.429 --> 04:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Bon thank
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and um I'm sorry I haven't
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
got gotten time to look through all that
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
but I think this is a quick answer so
 
04:05:02.830 --> 04:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
the the the obvious um thing that stands
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
out to me is the difference between
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
calendar days versus school days um and
 
04:05:11.710 --> 04:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
if I understood correctly um it's the
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
the 30 uh the school days comes from the
 
04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
Ida theed both they both timelines come
 
04:05:19.710 --> 04:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
from the Ida um in the fact that the
 
04:05:22.750 --> 04:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
expedited one is 30 school days for the
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
decision to be rendered and when that
 
04:05:27.309 --> 04:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
when that expedited was established it
 
04:05:29.149 --> 04:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
was because the purpose of the expedited
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
hearing was to ensure the matter was
 
04:05:32.990 --> 04:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
resolved promptly and the child's
 
04:05:34.910 --> 04:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
educational program is not adversely
 
04:05:36.910 --> 04:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
affected by undue delays that didn't
 
04:05:38.670 --> 04:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
quite work out the way they might have
 
04:05:42.070 --> 04:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
intended a followup please yes um so the
 
04:05:43.870 --> 04:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
only way to rectify the situation is is
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
change the state law because you can't
 
04:05:47.790 --> 04:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
do anything about the federal law yes
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
and and this you're not change the
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
federal law still says the timeline
 
04:05:53.229 --> 04:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
still are in place you're just saying
 
04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
that if it happens to take longer then
 
04:05:57.670 --> 04:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
it it can't take longer that we would
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that both were
 
04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
finished within the the shorter timeline
 
04:06:05.429 --> 04:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any further
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wanted to
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:18.269 --> 04:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
see none thank you we'll close that
 
04:06:21.229 --> 04:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
hearing and we're going to move on in a
 
04:06:36.590 --> 04:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%

04:24:09.109 --> 04:24:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay I believe we're about ready to
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
start our executive session and first
 
04:24:16.510 --> 04:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
will take up House Bill 677 requiring
 
04:24:18.670 --> 04:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
schools to maintain a supply of EpiPen
 
04:24:22.630 --> 04:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
injectors for use in the event of an
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
emergency um representative Terry uh do
 
04:24:27.510 --> 04:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
you have a motion that you would like to
 
04:24:30.990 --> 04:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
make uh yes Mr chairman uh I move all to
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
pass thank you is there a
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
second second representative
 
04:24:39.389 --> 04:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
Murray uh would you like to comment on
 
04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
your motion well in this instance uh I I
 
04:24:44.030 --> 04:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
I may speak to the bill whereas on the
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
previous two I I did not uh that's fine
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
with us it appears as though we may be
 
04:24:52.750 --> 04:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
on a track for a bipartisan vote uh on
 
04:24:55.830 --> 04:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
this bill so I will not necessarily uh
 
04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
feel that I need to belabor my remarks
 
04:25:00.990 --> 04:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
this uh this is is a common sense bill
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill and it reminds me of
 
04:25:06.109 --> 04:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
the bill that we had last uh term in um
 
04:25:09.670 --> 04:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
in Commerce with respect to um paddles
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh which uh for coronary events
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
um there were there were there was a
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
good discussion around this bill but I
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't recall that there were any um
 
04:25:22.670 --> 04:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
serious uh defects or deficiencies uh
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
that were pointed out by by any of us um
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
and so I think uh we should move
 
04:25:30.550 --> 04:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
expeditiously to move this bill forward
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
to the Full House and hopefully for
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
passage and signing the law thank you
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you rident Murray any comments
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair no I just think um
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
that this is it makes sense in the event
 
04:25:43.790 --> 04:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
of um there being an allergy which we
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
heard that there are high instances of
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
allergies where anaphylaxis can happen
 
04:25:51.630 --> 04:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
so I second the motion thank you any

Amendment 0103 H yes great thank
 
04:28:30.189 --> 04:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:37.389 --> 04:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:39.710 --> 04:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
Morris um would you like to speak to
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
your motion yes do I speak to the
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
amendment or to the bill
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
um you can speak to the um bill as
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
amended okay uh the amendment in front
 
04:28:51.269 --> 04:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
of you all was mentioned during the
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
hearing it just removes the reference to
 
04:28:54.670 --> 04:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
private schools because that was never
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
intended to be included um it just
 
04:28:58.590 --> 04:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
corrects an oversight that was made
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
during drafting the bill as amended
 
04:29:04.670 --> 04:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
remedies the existing process of best
 
04:29:06.429 --> 04:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
interest placements by increasing
 
04:29:08.550 --> 04:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
communication between superintendent and
 
04:29:11.550 --> 04:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
parents thus increasing transparency
 
04:29:13.630 --> 04:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
under current law parents May request
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
for their student to attend another
 
04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
school within the same district since
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
most requests result from unfortunate
 
04:29:22.510 --> 04:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances such as extreme bullying
 
04:29:24.510 --> 04:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
the superintendent typically approves a
 
04:29:26.790 --> 04:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
request however when requests for best
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
interest placements are denied parents
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
deserve to know why and this bill
 
04:29:33.870 --> 04:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
requires superintendent to explain in
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
writing why accommodations were not met
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
within 10 days of the decision and
 
04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore this bill requires best
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
interest placements to be approved
 
04:29:44.149 --> 04:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
absent a valid reason to deny the
 
04:29:46.469 --> 04:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
request and then finally this bill has
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
neither a fiscal impact nor an impact on
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
districts of only one available school
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
for the grade level so again I move off
 
04:29:55.590 --> 04:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
to pass thank you uh anything further
 
04:29:58.469 --> 04:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
repres no okay any other comments from
 
04:29:58.479 --> 04:29:59.670 align:start position:0%
repres no okay any other comments from
the

04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:02.710 --> 04:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
committee representative Woodcock thank
 
04:30:04.510 --> 04:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
you we talking about the main Bill the
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr chair um you can talk about
 
04:30:10.510 --> 04:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
either if you wish okay well I feel I'm
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
get the wrong look here but on on the
 
04:30:15.149 --> 04:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm just concern where it says
 
04:30:18.189 --> 04:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
shall um that we're requiring the
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent to do something uh I
 
04:30:23.590 --> 04:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
understand the need to have the the
 
04:30:25.109 --> 04:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
follow the quick followup that was that
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
was no question there's no there no need
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
to go beyond 10 days but and I
 
04:30:30.670 --> 04:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative from
 
04:30:32.910 --> 04:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
Salem made that change I still have
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
concern about requiring the
 
04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent exactly what he asked to
 
04:30:39.229 --> 04:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
do in law in terms of just the decision
 
04:30:40.550 --> 04:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
before he sees all
 
04:30:44.910 --> 04:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
data if I can I respond Mr chair yes um
 
04:30:47.229 --> 04:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
the amended language does not change the
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
sh the shall appears in the original
 
04:30:52.349 --> 04:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
bill as well the amendment only removes
 
04:30:54.269 --> 04:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
where it says approve private school
 
04:30:57.510 --> 04:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
that free words are changed that's
 
04:31:01.389 --> 04:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
it yes yes well the last the LA line
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
nine the superintendent shall approve
 
04:31:06.670 --> 04:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
the Roy class on less that's my concern
 
04:31:08.670 --> 04:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
yes and that appears within the original
 
04:31:09.910 --> 04:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill as well the amendment does not
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%

04:33:52.709 --> 04:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
reason that I will not be voting in
 
04:33:54.750 --> 04:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill is it presents a lot
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
of of issues that really aren't
 
04:34:00.310 --> 04:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
addressed in it it basically allows um a
 
04:34:04.070 --> 04:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
parent uh to decide where they want
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
their child to go to school in any
 
04:34:08.949 --> 04:34:08.959 align:start position:0%
school within the district there's a lot
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
of planning that goes on every year here
 
04:34:14.029 --> 04:34:14.039 align:start position:0%
with school districts and deciding
 
04:34:14.039 --> 04:34:15.189 align:start position:0%
with school districts and deciding
classroom

04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
04:34:17.429 --> 04:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
compositions um a lot of Staffing
 
04:34:19.990 --> 04:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
concerns knowing in advance what
 
04:34:21.750 --> 04:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
students you're going to be servicing in
 
04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
terms of special education services uh
 
04:34:27.150 --> 04:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
there is already a process in place for
 
04:34:29.629 --> 04:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
parents to do this but to make the
 
04:34:32.670 --> 04:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
assumption that the superintendent shall
 
04:34:35.470 --> 04:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
Grant the request without taking into
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
consideration all of these other issues
 
04:34:41.830 --> 04:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
I find to be problematic thank you
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you represent of Woodcock cell
 
04:34:47.470 --> 04:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
just a followup uh I also will not be
 
04:34:49.470 --> 04:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
suppoed this but my reason a little bit
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
different it doesn't identify the number
 
04:34:53.070 --> 04:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
of times a parent can apply or how many
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
times they can move during the year and
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't identify the super the school
 
04:35:00.590 --> 04:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
calendar and my concern is on Multi
 
04:35:02.830 --> 04:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
school like elementary schools or lar
 
04:35:04.750 --> 04:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
Community two middle schools when that
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
youngster moves the curriculum may not
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
be aligned at all and they could be way
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
behind or way ahead and then we lost
 
04:35:11.949 --> 04:35:11.959 align:start position:0%
teacher time going to the new class
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
reorientation so I think I I think the
 
04:35:17.029 --> 04:35:17.039 align:start position:0%
10day piece is is is by itself is
 
04:35:19.590 --> 04:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
terrific the rest I I I can't support
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
Cornell I also won't be supporting this
 
04:35:28.150 --> 04:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
um and I do like the the tend day thing
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
but it still says the superintendent
 
04:35:31.789 --> 04:35:31.799 align:start position:0%
does not find in the best interest of
 
04:35:34.990 --> 04:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
the student um can request a hearing to
 
04:35:36.910 --> 04:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
determine if the student is experience a
 
04:35:39.310 --> 04:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hard hardship
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's already in law so we don't really
 
04:35:44.109 --> 04:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
need to be doing this because they can
 
04:35:46.830 --> 04:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
request it and this and this one again
 
04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
says to determine if a student's
 
04:35:50.949 --> 04:35:50.959 align:start position:0%
experience a manifest educational
 
04:35:54.349 --> 04:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
hardship so I don't know that this is
 
04:35:57.551 --> 04:35:57.561 align:start position:0%
even necessary so I will be voting
 
04:35:59.709 --> 04:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
no thank
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%

04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
NATO uh would you like to speak to your
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
motion sure um we heard uh extensive uh
 
04:38:34.349 --> 04:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
testimony given uh on this uh on this
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
bill um and uh what we heard was was
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
rather interesting as we moved through
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
the testimony um both the uh
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent Association and the
 
04:38:48.429 --> 04:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
school boards Association indicated that
 
04:38:50.230 --> 04:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
they believed that this was unnecessary
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
and that um they were perfectly capable
 
04:38:55.949 --> 04:38:55.959 align:start position:0%
of being able to handle this um as uh
 
04:38:58.470 --> 04:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
School administrators and as local
 
04:39:02.310 --> 04:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
school boards um we um certainly value
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh local control here with respect to um
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
our schools and we hear this uh
 
04:39:11.150 --> 04:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um and I think um given the
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
fact that we have heard from the school
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
boards Association and the
 
04:39:15.709 --> 04:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
superintendent Association that they
 
04:39:17.869 --> 04:39:17.879 align:start position:0%
believe that they can provide a safe
 
04:39:20.670 --> 04:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
environment uh for the students in their
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
schools this bill is really
 
04:39:26.510 --> 04:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary uh one uh one final note
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
here that with respect to the
 
04:39:33.789 --> 04:39:33.799 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency tools um
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh once again this appears to be in a
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
front to local control because the word
 
04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
encourage is removed and the word
 
04:39:44.708 --> 04:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
require is being put in place um feel
 
04:39:47.230 --> 04:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
that's unnecessary thank
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you repres NATO do you have
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:39:54.910 --> 04:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
comments okay thank you comments from
 
04:39:54.920 --> 04:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
comments okay thank you comments from
the

04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:59.590 --> 04:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
committee represent Woodcock thank you
 
04:39:59.600 --> 04:40:01.070 align:start position:0%
committee represent Woodcock thank you
chair

04:40:01.070 --> 04:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:40:03.868 --> 04:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
um this bill has been a long standing in
 
04:40:06.030 --> 04:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
in uh the air quality piece and I made
 
04:40:08.030 --> 04:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
the note and I actually thought I
 
04:40:09.270 --> 04:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
written the Schoolboard Association
 
04:40:11.470 --> 04:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
supported it but apparently I was wrong
 
04:40:14.430 --> 04:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
um but that being said all this add all
 
04:40:17.590 --> 04:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
this does is add the temperature uh when
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
they do the annual the
 
04:40:24.628 --> 04:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
annual um inspection and the bill really
 
04:40:26.670 --> 04:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve a lot because they do the
 
04:40:28.230 --> 04:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
annual inspection typically in June and
 
04:40:30.150 --> 04:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
July when nobody's in the building but
 
04:40:32.310 --> 04:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
it does identify a need that teachers
 
04:40:34.510 --> 04:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
identified that impacts academic
 
04:40:36.270 --> 04:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
learning and that the heat in the
 
04:40:41.070 --> 04:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
building so when we have 75 NAD 85 990
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
and September because we don't have a
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
condition in the buildings or the only
 
04:40:45.350 --> 04:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
place that has it is the administrator's
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
office or the principal's office
 
04:40:48.430 --> 04:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
everyone else is faltering we really
 
04:40:50.350 --> 04:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
don't see a lot of learning going on and
 
04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
most of the windows in the last 10 years
 
04:40:54.628 --> 04:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
open an inch I mean there's not much air
 
04:40:55.868 --> 04:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
going through either they put the fans
 
04:40:57.628 --> 04:40:57.638 align:start position:0%
on it's just like another heating system
 
04:41:00.270 --> 04:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
so always saying to the people add in
 
04:41:03.190 --> 04:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
this bill when you do your policy to
 
04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
figure out where the poor air is at
 
04:41:07.708 --> 04:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
least check the temperature um where the
 
04:41:10.270 --> 04:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
other options because we have case after
 
04:41:12.708 --> 04:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
case after case of teachers and students
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
cting in classrooms all over this state
 
04:41:18.190 --> 04:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
in August September October and when
 
04:41:19.948 --> 04:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
days there's no learning going on
 
04:41:23.070 --> 04:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
because they too hot that's all thank
 
04:41:24.270 --> 04:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
you representative dry thank you um I
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about lines 11 to 13
 
04:41:35.550 --> 04:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
about emergency response planning and
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
heat ownness prevention um we've seen
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
three bills in the last year so when
 
04:41:44.150 --> 04:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
with aeds one with um epipens and now
 
04:41:46.830 --> 04:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
this one each one takes a little bit of
 
04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
a first aid course and makes it into
 
04:41:51.390 --> 04:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
required training for teachers that they
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
have to keep up it's not really taught
 
04:41:56.788 --> 04:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
that way you don't retain certification
 
04:41:59.310 --> 04:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
by doing little pieces of a first aid
 
04:42:01.750 --> 04:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
course to do that we heard from
 
04:42:03.390 --> 04:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard Association I believe that
 
04:42:05.470 --> 04:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
said there's another training that has
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
to be done and kept up really I don't
 
04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
see any way to keep the training going
 
04:42:13.230 --> 04:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
that say certified except maybe you say
 
04:42:15.550 --> 04:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
you've read something every year um and
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think you need a law to do that
 
04:42:19.628 --> 04:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
I look through the Tools for Schools to
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
see if they had any probable programs
 
04:42:23.830 --> 04:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we could do that they could say to
 
04:42:25.750 --> 04:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
do it they have nothing they just in
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
they just talk about air quality they
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
don't talk about temperature at all so
 
04:42:32.350 --> 04:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
there isn't really a program or a plan
 
04:42:34.150 --> 04:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
that you could actually say yes we're
 
04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
going to follow that we're going to
 
04:42:36.670 --> 04:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
train our teachers this and we're going
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they stay trained with
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't exist represent Dam
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I'm in support of
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
this bill it's a policy bill it's for us
 
04:42:50.310 --> 04:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
to be more thorough and diligent in
 
04:42:52.230 --> 04:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
considering what the school environment
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
for both students and staff is and I
 
04:42:57.150 --> 04:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
just want to officially say as a
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor there was no intent of
 
04:43:00.990 --> 04:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
affront to anyone for what they're doing
 
04:43:05.430 --> 04:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
that represent Woodcock thank you
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
represent in response represent Dr is
 
04:43:12.510 --> 04:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
common I think she she illuminates a a a
 
04:43:15.430 --> 04:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
marvelous point there is no plan and
 
04:43:17.230 --> 04:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
that's the point there is no plan for
 
04:43:18.990 --> 04:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
this to be taken care of and it's saying
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
to us we've had this problem for years
 
04:43:24.190 --> 04:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
now we're saying make a plan we had the
 
04:43:26.470 --> 04:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
I agree with you 100% Ro dry that there
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
is no plan as it stands now and the
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
schools hav been doing one nor have the
 
04:43:31.628 --> 04:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
superintendent nor have the principal
 
04:43:32.430 --> 04:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to
 
04:43:34.110 --> 04:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
temperature and heat control except for
 
04:43:35.948 --> 04:43:35.958 align:start position:0%
you know the nurses happen to be trained
 
04:43:37.470 --> 04:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
so I think all this bill says is you
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
have to do a plan you haven't done it
 
04:43:40.670 --> 04:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
for 20 years and now it's getting heater
 
04:43:40.680 --> 04:43:42.030 align:start position:0%
for 20 years and now it's getting heater
hotter

04:43:42.030 --> 04:43:42.040 align:start position:0%

04:43:42.040 --> 04:43:43.350 align:start position:0%

we strive to increase transparency while

ensuring privacy in
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
fura um this is a common sense piece of
 
04:45:53.150 --> 04:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislation um that will allow more
 
04:45:55.628 --> 04:45:55.638 align:start position:0%
transparency and will not create a
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
burden on the Department of Education
 
04:46:02.788 --> 04:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:06.270 --> 04:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
information repr Noble nothing further
 
04:46:08.350 --> 04:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
other comments from the
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative Boni
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the information that's
 
04:46:16.030 --> 04:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
being requested all of this is already
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
currently available on the special
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
education website I'm looking at a link
 
04:46:22.390 --> 04:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
that totally
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
analyzes all that is requested on uh the
 
04:46:33.150 --> 04:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
page two um lines 4 through 7 um what is
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
included in this particular Bill are
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
things that um might impact student
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
privacy um which include uh being able
 
04:46:47.150 --> 04:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
to detect who might be uh the student by
 
04:46:49.628 --> 04:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
the name of the school district and I
 
04:46:51.910 --> 04:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
cannot see any reason at all why we
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
would need the name of any law firm
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
representing the school district all of
 
04:47:00.390 --> 04:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
those other um a through D is right here
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
on the website and I would think that
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
this could be just handled by putting a
 
04:47:08.350 --> 04:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
link to the website thank you thank you
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
rson muray thank you I too um will be
 
04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
voting no on this motion uh with regard
 
04:47:16.030 --> 04:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
to the fact that um there is direct
 
04:47:17.548 --> 04:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
contradiction with regarding
 
04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
suppressions and um information in
 
04:47:22.030 --> 04:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
smaller districts that could identify a
 
04:47:25.750 --> 04:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
learner um unintentionally but because
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
of the types of services rendered um and
 
04:47:30.788 --> 04:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
to the same point that um representative
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
Bon had mentioned I do believe that most
 
04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
of this information is already available
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
on the Doe's
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
website thank you representative uh
 
04:47:39.920 --> 04:47:41.390 align:start position:0%

thank you reiterating the concerns about
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
small towns I represent nine communities
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
seven of them are less than 1500
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
residents cuden where I live has 28
 
04:47:54.628 --> 04:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
students in rc4 school
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
district if you identify the district

04:48:05.150 --> 04:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
right rent Woodcock be I just want to
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
add in we think of the commentary this
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
morning about the young woman who the
 
04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
woman who is here and said that her
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
youngster had been in private school for
 
04:48:16.150 --> 04:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
12 years if that came under this case
 
04:48:17.350 --> 04:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's no question about you know what
 
04:48:19.030 --> 04:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
school district she came from and she
 
04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
would have been self-identified by this
 
04:48:26.910 --> 04:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:28.830 --> 04:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
