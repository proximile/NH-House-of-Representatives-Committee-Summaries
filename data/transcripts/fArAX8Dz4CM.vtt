00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
first rule of testifying before this

committee turn the mic on
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and good
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is Shannon chandley
 
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%
and I serve the people of marac Wilton
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
Milford and Amherst in District 11 in
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
the Senate um I come before you today to
 
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
566 as the chair said it is to establish
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
a committee to study foster care
 
00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
families and the foster care system so
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
um I have served several terms in the
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
house and I'm in my second term in the
 
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and and throughout um my tenure I
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
have received calls from constituents
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
who have concerns about the foster care
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
system um you know these concerns um
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes people are quite desperate and
 
00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you've heard some of the um the
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that the folks have raised to
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
me here in your committee um they are
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
include they include um uh uh certainly
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
a lack of of uh placements for foster
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
children um discrepancies between kin
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
and non-kin fostering uh requirements of
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
the Foster family and the living space
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
so this bill was a way of trying to um
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
look at the entire issue in one setting
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
for a while I tried to come up with um
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
certain ways to maybe uh how can we and
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
for lack of the better term I'll use the
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
word fix the system but I think that
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily A system that is
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
broken it is a system that needs to be
 
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
um looked at so problems identified
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
challenges identified and solutions
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
created and I think that a study
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
committee might be the best place to do
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
that um I've reached out to various
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
shareholder uh stakeholders Advocates
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
and um members of the legislature who
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
are expert in this area and that
 
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
certainly includes um your chair and
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
honorable members of this committee and
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
I widespread support for doing this I
 
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
considered that there are there have
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
been um foster care subcommittees in the
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh oversite committee on
 
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS and there are other committees that
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees that look at
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
Children's Services but in Con in
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
consultation with a number of people
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
with expertise in the area seemed like
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
this might be the best way to move
 
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
forward um the bill is very simple it
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
sets up your standard uh study committee
 
00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
and I know many of us are loathed to uh
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
put forward more study committees where
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
issues are extremely important we need
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
to do that and um the charge is uh to
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
assess the regulations and requirements
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
to qualify as a foster parent um the
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
special circumstances of foster care
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
provided by relatives and how to best
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
provide guidance to recruit Anda uh and
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
maintain um potential Foster families um
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
it's not limited to that and the the
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee as it does its work May find
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
other areas where there are issues and
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
identify those as um needing Solutions
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
so with that I ask you to look favorably
 
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
upon SB
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
566 and um happy to take any questions
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
if you have any thank you before I turn
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
them loose I'm just noticing the
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
all-star cast of House members you have
 
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.190 align:start position:0%
all-star cast of House members you have
as

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors Greg Pearson patrino sidal
 
00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
wow it is it is I said that I could I
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
reached out to folks with a real if not
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
expertise working knowledge of these
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
issues and certainly the members of this
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
committee are those folks as my father
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
often said don't throw your shoulder out
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
by excessively patting yourself on the
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
back any questions for the
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
senator representative
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question fabulous Bill
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
I just have one quick question
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
um on line8 it says the members of the
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
committee shall receive mileage at the
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
legislative rate is there a reason to
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
not include federal rate I'm just
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
thinking of the accounting nightmare for
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
the that's the
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
same it is not no it's not so if that is
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely not a problem to address it
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the members of the
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
committee who would be eligible for that
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
rate I think it's worth
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
um does anyone know the difference so
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
I I know there is the state rate and the
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
federal rate but I did not I I assume
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
both were um encompassed in legislative
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
rate but that I I am absolutely willing
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
to change that to accommodate
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
the federal rate is not um included in
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
your income tax on your
 
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
1040 we can elect as I recall the
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
federal rate or or the legislative rate
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
legislative rate becomes income I signed
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
off saying I wanted the federal rate and
 
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
that is how I've been paid for eight
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
years and that's that's the reason I ask
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine that this person gets
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
the federal rate for the rest of their
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
legislative rates while we have the
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
senator here um perhaps we could move
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
past our own wallets and ask her any
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill otherwise thank
 
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Raymond thank you
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
Mr uh chairman and thank you for taking
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
my question sure so this is only my
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
first term in the house and so I don't
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
have uh a huge famili it with study
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
committees so when a committee like this
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
is formed do you also investigate how
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
other states potentially are doing
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
foster care and if there's things that
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
we can learn from them or is it only
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
kind of a review of our internal systems
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
it would Encompass both because it
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
really is at the um the chair will the
 
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
committee will be established and the
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
chair is able to run the committee as um
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
the chair sees fit and I think that
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
given C certainly within the parameters
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
outlined in the bill the uh chair may
 
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
decide that the way to do this is to
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
call in some of um the people from the
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
state and from the other agencies with
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
whom the state contracts to understand
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
what the situation is the there may also
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
be um people who have some concerns or
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
complaints who want to come and address
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh raise those issues before the
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
committee and in terms of seeking
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
Solutions looking at other states is one
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
of the potential ways to find
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
Solutions do you have a candidate from
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
the senate in mind who might like to
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
chair this committee um there are
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
several able and willing folks and um I
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
would certainly um be happy to do so but
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm defer to um the Senate
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
president's appointment you have good
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
Senators on this too anyone
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
else representative McMahon thank than
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Senator chandley uh just
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask uh in um for preface my
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
question is in optimizing the
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
performance level of the committee to be
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
appointed the starting point being has
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
there been an audit done of the foster
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
care system in in the state of New
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know I would think that
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
would something be something that would
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
have to be looked into I don't know how
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
recently that has been done
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
would followup Mr chairman follow up and
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
then uh because the with with the goal
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
of getting this done while we're young
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
because this a very important issue uh
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
would would you be aware though of any
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
highlights of um subject matters that
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
would be prevalent as issue one and two
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
for the committee to address so I think
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
issue one is pro and of course again
 
00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:28.759 align:start position:0%
this is subjective but issue one may
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
well be um how do we make sure that we
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
have enough foster care parents
 
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
available and issue number two is what
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
do we do to train and um and guide them
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
in their role as foster parents um and
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'll I'll make that issue
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
number one those two things are issue
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
number one and issue number two would be
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
what are the barriers why do people not
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
serve or why do they back away from
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
serving so a fiscal would be a reality
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
in in this
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
work a any any solutions that would be
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
proposed through legislation would
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
likely have a fiscal note but I'm not
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
sure of that right thank you senat
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%

brought this issue to Senator Ward uh in
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
the fall after conducting an in-depth
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
investigation into incidents of severe
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
child abuse where a number of infants
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
were not adequately protected in the
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
welfare system due in part to the
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
inability of dcyf medical providers and
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to timely and
 
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
effectively share
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
information uh that's that's why she
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
introduced Senate Bill 572 a bill that
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
establishes a commission to study the
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
sharing of confidential records between
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement the medical community
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
child protection services and the legal
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
Community this problem implicates a
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
number of state and federal statutes as
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
well as policies and procedures across
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
these three sectors the commission will
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
study the relevant laws the barriers to
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
information sharing in this Arena of
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary teams who investigate
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
child abuse and how to prevent such
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
roadblocks since many agencies are
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
involved in the work uh we need to
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
safeguard the sharing of information so
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
our children are protected while their
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
privacy is also protected I want to
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%

00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 572 I would defer questions to some
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
of the Advocates we have here and if
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
there's anything they can't answer I can
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
get your questions to Senator warden
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
answer

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so what we've
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
got is a few um entities they can't
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
share information with each other all
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
right like hipper is a a problem for you
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
right yeah there there are privacy
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
concerns with both medical and law
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement they have their own
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
standards and getting through those
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
silos so people can know when children
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
are at risk is the challenge and hipper
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
is a federal War isn't it it is and so
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
now what about the law enforcement one
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
uh well there are various uh privacy
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
concerns when you're dealing with a a an
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
investigation so state and federal laws
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
this is what the commission would would
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
do is look at all the relevant laws that
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
you need to comply with to see how how
 
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
can how can we share information without
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
breaking either state or federal law the
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
multidisiplinary followup yeah thank you
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman the multi-disciplinary uh
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
thing is about uh professional people uh
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
getting together that are involved in
 
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
the child's issues right correct um and
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
they they've been doing that for some
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
years now and so how have they worked in
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
the past without this with the problem
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
of this federal law and uh and police
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
now police
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
are um can't share like
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice things criminal okay
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
and is there something else
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
about Polie can't share well without
 
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
getting in any specific cases that have
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
happened in the past Senator Ward saw a
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
specific instances where children were
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
at risk and the right people weren't
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
able to tell the other people uh what
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
they knew so that they might be able to
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
prevent a tragedy this is what the the
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
purpose of the commission would be is to
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
find out where they might be gaps in the
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
system is there follow up is are there
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
any other entities besides those two
 
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.750 align:start position:0%
any other entities besides those two
entities

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
that have a a non-communication issue
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
well I think you'll see if you look at
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill there are a number
 
00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:54.039 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders that are included and I
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
think uh you've got the courts you've
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
got the office of child advocate DCF
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
um the house and the Senate and um law
 
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement Hospital friction points I'm
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
looking for the yeah I I think that's
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
something the commission would be
 
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
involved in in fleshing out and and
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
finding I I couldn't tell you myself the
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
only two okay yeah thank
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
you anything
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
further saying nothing thank you so much
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and if the senator could uh be
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
in touch with me uh a little bit later
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
on when the names of the committee will
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
be put together I appreciate that thank
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you chair recognizes um I
 
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
think I get it right Amy Roy or
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
that's oh there we go okay good
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
morning uh my name is Dr Amy Roy I am a
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
pediatric emergency medicine doctor uh
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
with the Elliott hospital and then I
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
of sorry um I also conduct specialized
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
medical exams for the child protection
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
programs both with the Elliot and at
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um I've been in that role I
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
think for about seven or eight years now
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
and uh certainly have encountered over
 
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
that time lots of issues with sharing of
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
information um as these
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary teams have sort of uh
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
taken root in New Hampshire you know I
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
think we in the medical community
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
certainly recognize them as really being
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
an invaluable tool for child protection
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
these provide uh a really critical and a
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
unique opportunity for um dialogue
 
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
between medical community child
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
protective services between law
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement sometimes other stakeholders
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
such as mental health and uh May serve
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
when we are able to come together and
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
have the kind of dialogue that we need
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
to have as an opportunity to really sort
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
of solidify and crystallize in uh in in
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
the sort of minds of those agencies that
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
there is significant reason for concern
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
for abuse and a real need to move
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
forward expeditiously um equally
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
importantly and I actually have a good
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
example of this uh sometimes what comes
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
out of these medical out of these
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team meetings is an
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
equally important opportunity to resolve
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
a concern for abuse so that a family may
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
really be able to put that episode
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
behind them and to um and to move
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
forward uh a recurring stumbling block
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
as we've already heard referenced here
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
is um the capacity to share information
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
and certainly amongst the medical
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
community um a pervasive concern is
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hippa fear of a HIPPA violation and the
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty that most routine medical
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
providers have in really understanding
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
the nuances of HIPPA which is a big
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
complex piece of federal legislation and
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
in knowing where there are in fact
 
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
protections and opportunities to share
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
information um certainly it's hard to
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
believe that the intention of HIPPA is
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
to prevent the sharing of information
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
that is really germine to um to
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
Children's Health but we uh certainly
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
need help in understanding how to
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
communicate that what the sort of
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
guardrails are and how to function
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
effectively but also legally within that
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team um setting I
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
think it's also important to remember
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
you know when we look at who is signing
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
consents to release information you know
 
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
in many of these instances a parent may
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
also be a perpetrator and that can be a
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
little bit complicated um so I think I
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
can say with real confidence that the
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
medical community would uh urge and
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
embrace the passing of this bill so that
 
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
we can have some clarity that would
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
allow us to um make these teams the
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
effective tool that we know that they
 
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.029 align:start position:0%
effective tool that we know that they
can

00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
be and I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
if there are any any questions
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
representa Vice chair lawn thank you Mr
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the testimony that we get
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
here often is medical uh
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
because if you have medical information
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
at the school district for example
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's not their medical
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
information um it's your medical
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
information uh now my understanding
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
medically is I don't know about four
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
years ago or
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
sooner um if the entity was
 
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.470 align:start position:0%
sooner um if the entity was
under

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
um uh if they if they were held to the
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
same uh confidentiality requirements
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
then it could be passed is is that still
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
the understanding I'm not sure I
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
understand that completely well it was
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
mostly on when we were looking at uh
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
doing um video uh medical appointments
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
but via vi video okay uh the passing the
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
passing we we looked at the passing of
 
00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
information um so that the other entity
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to start from the
 
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.710 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to start from the
beginning

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
um and we found out that if there
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
beholden to
 
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality then that information
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
can be passed to them are you familiar
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
with any changes of that sort no I feel
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
like I might not be the best person for
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
this question all right I think you know
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
between when there's sharing information
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
between medical providers who are really
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
operating under that same framework then
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
yes that is allowed um and beyond that I
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe so but I may not be the
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
person to ask okay all right thank you
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%

good morning everyone Lisa masio I am
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
the associate child advocate and with me
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
is Jennifer Jones one of our assistant
 
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
child Advocates I feel like I haven't
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
seen you all for a while you're we've
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
missed you too I've missed
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
you uh so we are here um as uh Senator
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
Ward's representative said uh this bill
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
was born of an issue that the office
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
discovered um last springish into the
 
00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.509 align:start position:0%
discovered um last springish into the
fall

00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
um as you know we are an independent
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
oversight agency overseeing All State
 
00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:04.190 align:start position:0%
oversight agency overseeing All State
serving

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
serving
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
agencies um and we support this bill
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
obviously as we helped write it we
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
worked closely with Senators Carson and
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley in the oversight
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
commission for children's services
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
around this issue um to increase
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
protection for vulnerable children and
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
this piece of uh legislation is kind of
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
central to that work in increasing
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
communication um around members of the
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
multidisiplinary AR team so I'm going to
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
let um Miss Jones here talk about the
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
process that this bill was born of a
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
little bit in the specific players to
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that have
 
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.870 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that have
been

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
asked good morning lovely to be here
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
with you all I feel like I haven't seen
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
this Committee in some time myself so
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's nice to be back um so I want to
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
talk a bit
 
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
about kind of getting down to the tech
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
technical pieces of what a
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team does and um why
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
it's so important that a
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team is able to
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
collaborate so when there is an
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
investigation concerning child abuse and
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
or neglect um particularly with
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
reference to the investigation that
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate conducted
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
um as Lisa mentioned um last year um we
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
took a look at approximately nine cases
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
where there were serious bodily injury
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
to 11 non-ambulatory infants so when
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a case like that
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be law
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement and dcyf so your States
 
00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
Child Protection collaboration that's a
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
co- investigation because we're not only
 
00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
looking at child safety but we're
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
looking a potential uh a criminal aspect
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
we know small infants can't injure
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
themselves um in the way that they were
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
injured in these cases that we we had um
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
been uh our office had been referred to
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
so so as we took a deep dive into the
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
communication so there were two aspects
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
to it we took a deep dive into reviewing
 
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
the records for each of these individual
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
cases meaning we were looking at the
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
communication between all members of the
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team so that includes
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Child Protection uh
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
prosecution excuse me as Dr Roy
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned sometimes that includes other
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
entities um like your non- investigative
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
collaborative team members like uh
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
crisis centers mental health and so we
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
were looking at again the communication
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
between those uh entities and how they
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
were collaborating as an investigative
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
team and we also did a system mapping
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
review so that we could look at human
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
factors right things that were barriers
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
um or things that may have occurred or
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
happened um just in decision day-to-day
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
decision- making of those investigators
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
as well as system barriers so we largely
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
found that in almost all of those cases
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
there was a breakdown in communication
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
at some point in time um that could have
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
been in the onset where law enforcement
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
was responding and asking questions and
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
getting information without the presence
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
of DCF or um quite the opposite where
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
CPS was out responding in the immediate
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement hadn't been looped
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
in just yet and so those investigations
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of moving parts so it's
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
not just about the child or infant being
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
seen in the immediate in the medical
 
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
information that may come out of that
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
one time appointment or that one time um
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
um uh you know referral to the Ed or um
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's lab work
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
there's um followup skeletal surveys
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
that may uncover or identify additional
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
injuries that didn't exist at the time
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
of the first initial examination and so
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
what happens is um in the respective
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
investigations as that information
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
continues to present itself so as you
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
know you can imagine it takes some time
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
for lab work to get back it takes
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
approximately two weeks for a skeletal
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
survey to car if the investigative
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
agencies are getting that
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
information at different times and not
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
able to share it creates a real
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
disadvantage about what one another
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
knows about their investigation and how
 
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.589 align:start position:0%
knows about their investigation and how
they're

00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
collaborating um and so we found it
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
imperative um to have this um study
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
commission to really get to some of you
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
know representative bigford had some
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
great questions um along with
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
resentative long about like how does
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
that work how can you do that in a
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
legally defensible way and that's why we
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
want this study commission so what does
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
it look like when there's medical issues
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
right but they're specific to child
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
abuse and what and how do we pursue
 
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.150 align:start position:0%
abuse and what and how do we pursue
those

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
investigations while honoring the
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
Privacy that all people are entitled to
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
medically but understanding that this
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
isn't you know this isn't just calling
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
up and inquiring about somebody's you
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
know average visit to their primary care
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
physician this is a child abuse
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
investigation and safety is Paramount so
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
what does that look like and how can we
 
00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:08.599 align:start position:0%
navigate it in a way that um we're
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
really not running into um one
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
investigative agency having information
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
the other doesn't um as you can imagine
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
a collaborative investigation requires
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
good communication and timely
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
communication another um issue that we
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
were able to um elicit from our system
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
map is that this also um sort of in the
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
long game when these things go to trial
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
if dcyf Andor law enforcement don't have
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
the Child's full medical record and they
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
don't have all the records in their
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
Discovery medical professionals can't
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
speak to it at trial as expert Witnesses
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
and that really really can impede the
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
judge's ability to assess safety in a
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
way that they have all of the facts and
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of it's a really multi
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
faceted issue and that's why we are
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
fully in support of the study commission
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much for your time I'm
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions oh sorry
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
did you have more I you can either ask
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
questions or I can tell you more and
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
then you can ask both of us questions up
 
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
sir I'll I pick B okay I'll keep going
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
so um as Jen said it it is a very
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
complex area rather than us just try and
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
write a bill that would somehow cover
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
Hippa and law enforcement and dcyf the
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
study commission will help because some
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
of the specific barriers we were seeing
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
is it does appear under the current laws
 
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
and I I did attach you I know we all
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
like appendices appendix a which is a
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
compilation of all the relevant
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
rsas it is clear from those read
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
together that the legislature intends
 
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
for these multidisciplinary teams to be
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
able to communicate however fortunately
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
there are some gaps some of these
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
statutes require rul making which just
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
never occurred so that's a gap some of
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
them just sort of become circular in
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
logic so for example dcyf gets medical
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
records and they get law enforcement
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
records however they currently read
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
their confidentiality statute to mean
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
they can only disclose their records I.E
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
things they created their case notes not
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
even to include the cap exam that they
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
paid for and sent the child to so
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's this this like chicken in the
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
egg problem that dcyf now has a lot of
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
records and can't share it with anybody
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
else they can't give law enforcement the
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
cap exam they can't tell medical what's
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
happening um so that's um a gap that
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be solved however we didn't
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
want to just sort of infringe a solution
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
on them we wanted the players to come to
 
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
the table and say how can we overcome
 
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
that similarly law enforcement
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
especially during an active
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
investigation against a parent of one of
 
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.990 align:start position:0%
investigation against a parent of one of
these

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
children don't necessarily want to share
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
notes about an active investigation
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
because if they give it to dcyf because
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
this is a court case they're required to
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
disclose it in Discovery so now you're
 
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
actually giving records to the
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
perpetrator so it's it's a complicated
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
issue in that mapping all of the parties
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
said we really want to fix this we
 
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
really want to be able to talk to each
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
other but these are all complicated
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
issues we need to sit down at a table
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
and figure out what to do uh that
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
mapping did also discover another Gap um
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
at the court that some of the current
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
laws around abuse and neglect area 169
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
see the definitions are being
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
interpreted in a way to require a much
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
higher standard than necessary so we do
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
have another bill I believe you're
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
hearing soon uh when it comes over s SP
 
00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
459 addresses that issue so we we're
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of address the discret
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
issues and allow this multi-disciplinary
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
team which the legislature created but
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
execution now you get to ask questions
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's Vice chairman
 
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
for your testimony uh
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
I mean this is probably going to put a
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
stick in the wheel uh but we hear
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
several testimony uh of parents being
 
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
left out of the loop I you know I I
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
understand there are some things you
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
want to keep from them if they're the
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
ones being investigated but we're off
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
often hearing that even if the court or
 
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
somebody deems uh that it wasn't at that
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
level they're still not hearing that and
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
and um the child is still either being
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
kept from them or so I'm wondering if
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's I mean I get this information um
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
confidenti Aly sharing um but also if
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
parents could be even a parent that's
 
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.390 align:start position:0%
parents could be even a parent that's
not

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
um um that's not uh being investigated
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
for abuse uh they're not getting the
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
information um so they don't know what's
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
happening with their child they don't
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
know what one entity or another entity
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's law enforcement
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
DCF uh whomever um so I I I think that
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
would be I I think it would be helpful
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
knowing where the gaps are in with the
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
parents uh we know what we want to keep
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
from whomever is being investigated I
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
get that uh but my understanding through
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
um testimony uh from parents is that
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're not getting investigated however
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
they still can't get any information
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
about their child so this Bill thank you
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
for the question and I hear what you're
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
saying because we've we've heard similar
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
things frankly parents call our office
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
saying I can't figure out what's going
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
on um this particular Bill send them to
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
you than feel free um this particular
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
bill has to do with the professional
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team which is created
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
under statute already it is only
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
professionals sharing information about
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
an ongoing open child abuse case under
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
some of the statutes though that I
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
included in this appendix though RSA 170
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
g8a is dcf's confidentiality statute
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
which is very clear that a parent who is
 
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
which is very clear that a parent who is
under

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
investigation is allowed to get in
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
information about their case unless the
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
department determines that disclosing to
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
that parent likely if they're a
 
00:42:56.349 --> 00:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
potential perpetrator would um the harm
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
to the child would be outweighed so
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's within statute it's also within
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
um again sometimes there have been
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that should be made
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
that haven't been made or maybe are
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
outdated um but parents receiving
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
information I think would be a separate
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
issue that a parent would need to deal
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
with with these separate entities law
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement has rules around who's
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to see an ongoing investigation
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
which is usually nobody and then Hippa
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
as Dr Roy mentioned it is actually
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
usually the parent that holds all the
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
control in a Hipp of situation as far as
 
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
giving consent which again in this case
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
if the parent is the perpetrator
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
allowing them to refuse to disclose that
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
child's medical records can actually
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
really endanger that child um but
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
parents getting information is actually
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
part of some of these statutes and is
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
separate from this particular
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
multidisciplinary team just because of
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
the way it was established in stat right
 
00:43:52.319 --> 00:43:56.030 align:start position:0%
the way it was established in stat right
thank

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:08.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no more cards on this Bill thank
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
what oh I'm
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
sorry representative McMahon sorry no no
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine you're multitasking as
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
always Mr chairman don't worry about it
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
I just have a question for see it's
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
moving up I used to miss representative
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
Raymond and I got that one solved and
 
00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.990 align:start position:0%
Raymond and I got that one solved and
yeah

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
sorry Cooperative collaboration to
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
achieve consensus is now in place
 
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
okay attorney I relative to the 170 G8
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
confidentiality uh that you kindly
 
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
provided at uh I want to ask your
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
guidance on relative to the authority
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
having jurisdiction it appears to be the
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner or designate on
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
whether information
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
that says here if it outweighs the need
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
for the disclosure then they can um deny
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
that would you have recommendations on
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
specific language that would need to be
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
changed in existing law so it doesn't
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
become a Quantum physic calculation as
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
to impact but it is application versus
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation of application of
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
distribution of confidential
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
information thank you for your question
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
I think this study commission could
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
potentially take up that that question
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
as part of of the multidisciplinary team
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from when I was a dcyf
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
attorney um so these aren't 91a requests
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
so they're not handled in quite the same
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
way these 170 g8a information requests
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
typically do go to the legal department
 
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:47.559 align:start position:0%
within any uh district office and then
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
the discussion is held um at that level
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
of weighing those pros and cons of
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
danger to that child for the disclosure
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
versus the parents right under the
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
statute to get the records it can go all
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
the way up to field administrator level
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
or you know dcyf State office level
 
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:08.559 align:start position:0%
typically the commissioner herself is
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
not involved in those conversations um
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
but it certainly could be um part of a
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
conversation around this statute I think
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
this multidisciplinary team because the
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
parent is not part of that professional
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
team That explicit question would not
 
00:46:27.309 --> 00:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
come up but this statute's key as as far
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
as what information sharing means who's
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
assessing it and at what level so um P
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps language could be offered um I
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
think I don't know of any personal cases
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
where this has been an issue right now
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
it it is meant to the whole statute is
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
meant to protect children so it is
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
weighed with the child safety in mind
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
one followup Mr chair follow up um I'll
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
stipulate to agreeing with you on
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
protecting the children that's not up
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
for debate the issue is the application
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the protection for the children as
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
you both have correctly pointed out if
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is playing a major role
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
in this is there a representative I was
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
just looking at Who members of the
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee is there a representative of
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office that then
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
would then that should be if not so
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
designated a part of this uh
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort so the folks that
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
are on this particular study commission
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
are relating more specifically to that
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team so it is the
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
director of dcyf who would sort of
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
represent the field and then the a
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
representative of the DCF legal
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
department because it is the DCF legal
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
department that ultimately is making
 
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.030 align:start position:0%
department that ultimately is making
these

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
interpretations of statutory release so
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
it is dcyf legal that has decided even
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
though this is our cap exam that we have
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
done we can't show it to anybody else
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
because that's how we're reading the
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
statute so I think probably especially
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
because DHHS is such a huge uh
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
Department the commissioner's office is
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
not really a person that's involved with
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
this multi disciplinary team
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
particularly but it is dcyf legal as
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
well as dcyf director who's ultimately
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
kind of assessing those specific cases
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'll leave it at that thank thank
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
chairman after Resolute search I see no
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
hands up so thank you so much thank you
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
and this uh concludes the hearing on
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
572 Senator Ward and I had an extensive
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
conversation about a few aspects of this
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill so you are now being
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
handed an
 
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.030 align:start position:0%
handed an
amendment

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
and yes this is hot off the press the
 
00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
amendment has been worked and reworked
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
um and once you
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh can I have one please sorry may I
 
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
have one excuse
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
me so once you get it I suggest you put
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
it side by side with
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
um the original bill the bill is
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
submitted and I'll walk you through the
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:32.109 align:start position:0%
 
made

00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
and for the OCA purposes uh let me give
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
you a sneak peek uh for reasons I'll
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
elaborate everybody else on the
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
commission now becomes consultants and
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
the only members of the renamed
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
committee are five legislators this is
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
because of recently passed RSA
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
1449 but everybody who was not alleged
 
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
lator who was in the commission is also
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
being mentioned by title as consultants
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
because we want them there and then
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
there's a few other adjustments along
 
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
the way so this is not substantive to
 
00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.079 align:start position:0%
the task of this group it is simply a
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
matter of bringing the membership into
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
compliance with uh an RSA so if
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
everybody has um both please look at the
 
00:50:27.079 --> 00:50:28.349 align:start position:0%
everybody has um both please look at the
original

00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
26 line 26 says notwithstanding RSA 1449
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
the membership of the commission shall
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
be in other words I know it's in law but
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it that way um
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're backing off that um and so if you
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
look over at the amendment page 1 line
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
11 the members of the committee and it's
 
00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:58.839 align:start position:0%
named now a committee not a commission
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
shall be as before one member of the
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
Senate is appointed by the president of
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
the senate senate award suggests four
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
members of the House appointed by the
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House of Representatives
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
one from this committee one from Health
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
and Human Services elderly Affairs
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
committee and two members from any
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee we want to make sure we get
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
the subject matter experts from the
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
house appointed as they will do in the
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
Senate at least one of whom shall be a
 
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
member of the minority party now look at
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
line 16 the committee shall te shall
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
seek testimony from various persons and
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
agencies in order to accomplish its
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
purpose these shall include but not
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
limited to that's the whole list of
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
people and the bill is submitted on the
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
top of page two it's the same folks we
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
want them there
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
but the reason the LSR was was was made
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
was large committees with Quorum uh find
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't make their Quorum
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
they have difficulties in steering a
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
large ship so we want them to come if
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
they want to come to every meeting
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
they're welcome to if they only can come
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
to certain meetings that doesn't
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
penalize the work of the committee so
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
that's the main change But continuing on
 
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
therefore uh page two in the
 
00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:30.710 align:start position:0%
therefore uh page two in the
amendment

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
um the original bill says this group
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
will meet 10
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
times and then it said the preliminary
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
report will be November 1st good luck
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
and then it said the final report will
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
be in 2025 which is after the
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
election so this we saw some
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
difficulties with that and so the 10
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
meetings is out they can meet as often
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
as the five of them are willing to meet
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
and the final report is due in
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
2024 so that is the amendment Senator a
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
Ward and I came up with um which we
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
think makes this a more wieldy
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
committee um so I'll give you a minute
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
to chew on that and ask me any questions
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman may I yes um some question
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%

consent if it needs an amendment for the

legislative or are we just going to
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
leave it as it was with legislative
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
mileage I think we can get a floor

heart-wrenching Hallmark movie it has

United States Department State

Department labels marriage before the
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
age of 18 as a human rights abuse just
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
before New Hampshire finally took a
 
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
modum of action in raising the marriage
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%

coerced by her parents they are now
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
divorced another objection is a

comparison of our own personal and

all together getting married for longer
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%

Credit Opportunity Act of
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%

01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
right to open their own bank Bing and
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
credit accounts outlawing discrimination
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
by sex in banking before that women
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
generally could not take out loans
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
without a male co-signer and lenders
 
01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
often saddled female borrowers with
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
higher interest rates and larger down
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
payment requirements marriage at that
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
time was a financial best case scenario
 
01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
the past 50 years have changed the
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
landscape of financial opportunity for
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
American women dramatically we need to
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
recognize the so socialization of women
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
and girls in the 1950s and 60s is so
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
very different than today I'm thrilled
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
to be joined here today by Advocates
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
from the national organization dedicated
 
01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:47.799 align:start position:0%
to the eradication of child marriage in
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
America Unchained at last they will be
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
providing the committee with more
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
indepth statistics and personal
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
experience as a visual for a moment
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
think about the Hall of
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives now fill that room
 
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
halfway and those are the children
 
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.229 align:start position:0%
halfway and those are the children
married

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
married
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
off imagine facing each one of those
 
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
kids trapped in a marriage contract they
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
cannot exit and say there just aren't
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
enough of you to justify my doing
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
anything to prevent this Hall from
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
filling up keep in mind none of those
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
children can gain sanctuary in a
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence shelter if they need
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
it because they aren't old enough I want
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
to make it eminently clear that raising
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
the age of marriage does not in any way
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
shape or form pass judgment on anyone
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
else's marriagein marriage origin story
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
my parents
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
included we can celebrate those who
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
followed a Teenage Love Affair into a
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
decades long marriage while
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
simultaneously acknowledging that
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
marriage is more than a love story it's
 
01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
a contract too a contract that should be
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
entered into by consenting adults we are
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
the policy makers we can make this right
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
and set the legal age to enter into a
 
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
marriage contract at 18 contracts are
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
for adults let's fix this in New
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I urge the committee to
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
recommend Senate Bill 359 as amended
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the senator
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
I don't have an amendment uh the bill
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
itself was amended by the Senate at the
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
top where it says as amended by the
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
Senate yes yeah that's what I meant
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%

01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:56.110 align:start position:0%
that's that was a good giveaway
yeah

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
no more amendments I it's all done yes
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%

Horgan from straford District 10 to come

01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
minutes Senator iller could you fill out
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
a pink
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
yeah you
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
did okay okay the clock starts now thank
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
you so I'm Ron and Timothy Horan from
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
staford County District 10 which is just
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
a town of town of Durham so I was around
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
in um 2009 when we passed the marriage
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
equality law which actually
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
um to take advantage of uh same you know
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage both parties had to be
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
18 and I think that was part of a
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
process of uh perhaps simplifying and
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
clarifying our understanding what
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
marriage is which is it's first and
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
foremost a contract between two people
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
um and we used to think that one had to
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
be male and one was was female and now
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's common place for people of the same
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
gender to marry but that's
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
uh that was something we recognized when
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
we uh created same gender marriage is
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
something that should apply to uh when a
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
a male and a female are U are marrying I
 
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
mean yes people who married their lives
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
are connected in all sorts of ways and
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
but there's lots of people
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
um who aren't married to each other who
 
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
are raising children lots of people
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
married to each other who are living
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
together lots of people who aren't
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
married to each other who are having sex
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
and that was true before 2009 it's even
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
more true now so I think
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
um I think having a Uniform age of 18 to
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
enter into the marriage contract is uh
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
is is just basically the way to go so
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's just not an
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
equal it's just not a valid relationship
 
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
if either party or perhaps in some case
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
both are not able to enter into a
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
contract without parental uh parental
 
01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
horm Mission and of course the marriage
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
the divorce rate for people marry you
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
know child marriages is very high and
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
some cases uh the need to divorce
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
happens even
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
before um the party is is 18 and that
 
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
creates a very major problem since they
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh aren't able to initiate the divorce
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings um if they're under 18 so
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's um so I think I think just simple
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
common sense it just clarifies the
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
evolution we've already seen in maritt
 
01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
law over the years and it as I said it's
 
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
a contract between those two people and
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's lots of other stuff involved but
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
it's basically a commitment between
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
those two people so they should both be
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
able uh they should both be adults and
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
able to freely enter in a contract and I
 
01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
don't know if the military thing is
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
going apparently it's not going to come
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
up during this hearing today which is
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
good but it it has come up on the floor
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the past and um so the military um
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
the only
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
the the military U you can your child is
 
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for military benefits
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether you're married to
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
the other parent there's only issue is
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
maybe you can't live on the base if
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
you're not married 10 seconds represent
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
um the military thing which may or may
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
not come up during this debate C
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
apparently not during the hearing is non
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
is kind of nonsensical and if you feel
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to come up you probably
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
should have your researcher clarify it
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
cuz any questions for the represent
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
resentative than representative Panic
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm my understanding is once a 16
 
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
or 17y old enters into a marital
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
contract that they are considered by the
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
state an adult and that they could go to
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
see a lawyer and get the marriage
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
nullified or go through a divorce cuz
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
once they met ENT into a marital
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
contract they considered adults so I
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
think it that's what my understanding
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
was last year when this bill came that I
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
would just say I'm not necessarily the
 
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
right person answered i' I'm not a I'm
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer I've also actually never
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
been legally married but I have been in
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
Partnership so I would just say that's
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
probably something um we should have our
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
excellent research team clarify because
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's actually true but
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
even if you are sort of Legally
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
considered an adult it's still more
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
difficult called if you're um under 18
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
and then there's problems you know after
 
01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
the divorce is granted too so I would I
 
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
would just I would my first impression
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
is um I I disagree with what you're
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
saying but that's probably an issue that
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh we should have the research to
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
clarify if you think that's an issue
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
before we exec the bill and certainly um
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
it should be clarified before we have
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
the floor debate because I know I know a
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
lot of site issues have come in in past
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
floor debates and derail previous
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
attempts to pass this legislation so
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's about about all I have to say
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
lengthy answer but thank you any further
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%

happened in New Hampshire um in the past
 
01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
year or two um I used to I haven't um
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
gotten the full update but I'm sure
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
somebody will be bringing that forward
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's zero and the year before I think
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
to no somebody with the answers will be
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
bringing them forth so let us not
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
Perez uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:41.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you know that I'm
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
being very vocal about this issue and
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
then I always support anything that has
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
to do with child marriage but my
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
question to do is um on line two and
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
three uh no person below the age of 18
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
she'll be capable of Contracting or B
 
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
marriage or marriage contract as such a
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
person she be null or void
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
um this is my only
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
concern and I know that I'm a Survivor
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
that you know I was I was married when I
 
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
was younger but my concern is that we
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
have people coming from other countries
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
that we have different different points
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
of view and by not avoiding something
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just concerned that not every
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
single marriage entering into abused
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
relationship or uh not work uh that's
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
the only concern that I do have so that
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
would fall under where we do we're state
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
to state type thing where we do
 
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
recognize that and if you get married
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
like out of state where they allow it or
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
out of the country where they do allow
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
that then we have to fall under Federal
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
Juris ction I believe that's the Full
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
Faith and Credit Clause of the
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution so they wouldn't suddenly
 
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
be unmarried when they moved to New
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%

01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%

01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
kind of um stem from some of the um
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
testimony from the representative before
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
we have a problem with teenage girls
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
cohabiting with older men and with um
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
their teenage
 
01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.510 align:start position:0%
their teenage
boyfriend's

01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
boyfriend's
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
parents um you know living with with
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
them are you aware
 
01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:11.639 align:start position:0%
of a young woman at the age of 16 or 17
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
or 15 who is in that situation would
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
they be able to go to a domestic abuse
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
shelter um I because they're underage I
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
believe anybody under the age of 18 will
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
be turned away from all domestic abuse
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
shelters because they do not have a
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
legal guardian with them and most of
 
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.990 align:start position:0%
legal guardian with them and most of
those

01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
that um like if someone is trying to get
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
away from their spouse or whoever then
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
in these instances of child marriages
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
there are many victims who have gone to
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
domestic violent shelters and who have
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
been turned away or the police have been
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
escorted back to escorting them back to
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
their parents or their legal guardian
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
who happens to be their husband who then
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
further abuses them even more because
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
they try to get away from them followup
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%

age of majority um typically these

stories are accompanied by
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
um severe trauma sexual emotional

consequences such as um as you've heard
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
heart disease um mental health concerns
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um children who

have experienced four or more Aces have
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
higher rates of being uh trafficked um
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
something as simple as back pain all of
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
these things can be mitigated by having
 
01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
protective factors in place having
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
supportive uh adults outside of their
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
homes having
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
um uh access to services this bill is a
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
really important and critical step in
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
establishing one of those protective
 
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
factors protecting our young kids from
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
entering into a contract and having
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
these traumatic
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
experiences I'll also note that this is
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
part of a national movement there have
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
been um 11 states soon to be 12 states
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
that have um enacted legislation similar
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
to this um to end child marriage in
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
their states additionally um to answer
 
01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
rep panic's question there have been 215
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
minors married since 2000 between 20
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
2000 and
 
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
2023 um since 2019 there have been nine
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
children who have been married 83 % of
 
01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
these were girls wed to adult men with
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
an average age difference of 4 years
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
older from the child who was married and
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
the 2018 legislation was certainly well-
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
intended but only protected about 4% of
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
the individuals that it needed to
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
protect the rest of those those um cases
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
are aged 17 and above every single life
 
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
is important even one child marriage is
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
too many um we have done as a state so
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
much to invest in our system of care and
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
invest in the mental well-being of our
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
children I think this is a a critical
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
next step in ensuring that we mitigate

issue um 30 40 50 year olds may not be

about the legal rights and

parents prematurely relinquishing their

used as a tool of child traffickers
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
somebody taking a 16-year-old across
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
state lines for an nefarious purposes is
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
committing a felony somebody taking
 
01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
their wife across state lines is just
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%

01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
96% of the minors who married in New
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire before 2018 were aged 16 or 17
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
so the 2018 legislation only protected
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
4% of the individuals it was intended to
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
protect but s SP 359 isn't about
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
creating a better system to enter minors
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
into marriage this bill will do what 11
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
other US states have done and set the
 
01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
marriage age at 18 no exceptions uh
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
because child marriage itself is
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
inherently dangerous as you heard this
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with maturity minors
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
don't automatically wake up on their
 
01:31:51.629 --> 01:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
18th birthday with some Newfound wisdom
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
or ability to make good decisions what
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
they do wake up with his all the rights
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
of adulthood they didn't have even the
 
01:31:57.629 --> 01:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
day before and that's so crucial
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
especially for a minor who is being
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
forced to marry before a minor turns 18
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
they can't even open the door and leave
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
home to get away if their parents are
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
planning an unwanted wedding for them uh
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
minors who run away from home are
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
repeatedly repeatedly can be deemed a
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
child in need of services and summon to
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
a court hearing to determine further
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action in our experience
 
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence shelters across the US
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
will routinely turn away unaccompanied
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
minors and youth shelters in general are
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
not a solution uh they typically only
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
limit the state to 21 days and their
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
main goal is to reunite that with their
 
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
parents uh additionally a minor can't
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
easily retain an attorney because
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
contracts with minors are voidable and
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
they generally can't file a legal action
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
which just creates additional obstacles
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
for them and representative panic I want
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
to address a question you asked earlier
 
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
yes miners are automatically emancipated
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
upon marriage which does bring some
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
limited legal rights of adulthood
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
however these rights do arrive too late
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
to prevent a forced marriage that minor
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
would first have to undergo the trauma
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
of a forced marriage which in our
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
experience can typically mean being
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
pulled out of school raped on her
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
wedding night and forced into a life of
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual servitude and you
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
can't undo this trauma and you can't un
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
rape a minor just by giving them some
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
limited rights of adulthood by
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
emancipating them afterwards also the
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
rights of emancipated minors are as I
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
said limited in our experience domestic
 
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
violence shelters will turn away even
 
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
emancipated minors and emancipated
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
minors often have trouble accessing the
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
rights that they do have imagine for
 
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
example how a landlord would feel uh
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
about renting an apartment to a 16 or
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
17-year-old uh and because of these
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
limitations globally child marriage is
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
recognized all child marriage is
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
recognized as being forced marriage
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
because minors just simply do not have
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
all of the rights of adulthood they need
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
to enter any contract let alone a
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
contract as serious as marriage and
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
because of this when girls have reached
 
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
out to Unchained who provides Direct
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
Services to those who are facing forced
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
marriages when girls under 18 have
 
01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
reached out and asked for our help and
 
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
have learned of their limited legal
 
01:33:44.109 --> 01:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
options we've unfortunately seen some
 
01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
turn to self harm and even suicide
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
attempts uh so for all those reasons I
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
ask you to please do what the Senate did
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
and vote Yes on SP 359 and I'm happy to
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:33:55.159 --> 01:33:56.550 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
representative

01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um are you
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with our present
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
law here in New Hampshire yes uh 16 and
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
17 year olds can uh enter into marriage
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
with the consent of one parent and
 
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.070 align:start position:0%
with the consent of one parent and
judicial

01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
review follow up um because I um do
 
01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
think that um they do have certain
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
legal uh rights under that law so as I
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
said yes when they're married they're
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
automatically emancipated and they do
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
get some limited rights of adulthood um
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
but as I mentioned those rights arrive
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
too late to prevent a forced marriage
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
and you know that trauma unfortunately
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
can't be undone just by giving them some
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
of those limited rights of adulthood um
 
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
and additionally as I mentioned those
 
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
rights are only limited and in our
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
experience domestic violence shelters
 
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
minors thank you for your testimony
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%

thank you I am Michelle hanash I am the
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
director of policy and women's programs
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
at the AHA Foundation we are a nonprofit
 
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
working to unharmful practices like
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
child marriage we also receive those
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
help requests from individuals fleeing
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
forced marriages across the us including
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
for minors and it is because of these
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking stories that we are so
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
adamantly in support of
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
s359 and keeping the marriage age at 18
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
and eliminating the dangerous loopholes
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
that allow for children to be entered
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
into marriage and I believe in the past
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
it had been asked whether it would be a
 
01:36:03.149 --> 01:36:03.159 align:start position:0%
good idea to add a military exception to
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
the marriage age that's not currently
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
the law and that's not proposed in Sp
 
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:09.159 align:start position:0%
359 but I'd like to take just a few
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
minutes to explain why that would not be
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
a good idea so first to explain the
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
common misconception you do not need to
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
be married to list the mother of your
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
baby or anyone for that matter is the
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of your death benefits and
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
as you heard children receive service
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
members benefits regardless of their
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
marital status and using other spousal
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
benefits that would not apply like
 
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
health insurance or housing to a
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
non-married partner are not a reason to
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
keep children entered into child
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
marriage using someone's Current
 
01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:42.679 align:start position:0%
financial dependency as a as a
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
justification for child marriage will
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
only keep them further dependent and
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
ryant on public assistance government
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
aid for a lifetime we all believe that
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
there are other Solutions than entering
 
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
children into contractual sexual
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
relationships in order to receive
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
housing or Healthcare we would say
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid not marriage and sadly people
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
sitting here today testifying in support
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
of this bill have had to help children
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
who were being forced to marry service
 
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
members and those children receive
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
protection as much as any child being
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
forced to marry a civilian and you
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
should know military exceptions are not
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
the norm only one state Alaska has a
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
military exception we couldn't find any
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
any country even in a war torn area like
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan that actually has a service
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
member exception we have support from
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
service member advocacy groups who are
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
saying don't support child marriage in
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
our name a a letter of support was
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
submitted by protect our Defenders
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
saying just this we urge you to listen
 
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
to them and not cling to child marriage
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
a harmful practice that prevents girls
 
01:37:49.629 --> 01:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
from having Liberty economic freedom
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities we urge you to
 
01:37:55.629 --> 01:37:55.639 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation as soon as
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
possible thank you so
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
much any
 
01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.830 align:start position:0%
much any
questions

01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
aha representative I might as well just
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
get everybody upset with me we're not
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
upset with you after I say this we'll
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
our lunch quickly thank you Mr chairman
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
um my confusion here
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
is we're advocating for genital
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries for children
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
under 18 years old but you're not going
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
to allow them to be married under 18
 
01:38:32.189 --> 01:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
years old I can't seem to line those two
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
different thought processes up I think
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
something like this needs to be left
 
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
alone it has to be a question
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
representative I mean how do you how do
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
you how do you justify that part and
 
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
then this part here where you're saying
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
you can't get married we'll reassign
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
genital surgeries but we won't allow you
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
to get married it just how do you as
 
01:38:59.950 --> 01:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
square that away sure thank you for the
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
question as as people have mentioned
 
01:39:05.229 --> 01:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
marriage is a contractual relationship
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
18 is the age to enter into
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
contracts setting the marriage age at 18
 
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
I should say keeping the marriage age at
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
18 and eliminating the loopholes is
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
entirely consistent with the laws when
 
01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
it comes to entering into a contract and
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't um allow children to be
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
abused used because of other issues that
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
are being debated when it comes to
 
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
legislation ending child marriage is
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
entirely consistent with the laws on
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
childhood and on contracts and
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise having loopholes in the law
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
completely makes a mockery of of so many
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
other laws when it comes to
 
01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
children thank you any further
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Tre recognizes Mr Dana
 
01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:55.270 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Tre recognizes Mr Dana
Al

01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
Al
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
minutes yeah good morning Mr
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you uh just to address a
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
few things I heard earlier to begin with
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
a brief anecdote I once found myself
 
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
outside an abortion clinic speaking to a
 
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:23.950 align:start position:0%
outside an abortion clinic speaking to a
young

01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
young
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
African-American gentleman very upset uh
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
that his uh European girlfriend uh was
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
not going to allow him to be a
 
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
father and so it seems uh uh this is off
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
topic please speak to the bill a brief
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
anecdote to uh frame the bill please all
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
right so the First Choice it seems is
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
death and I'm speaking to R Perez's
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
content uh a comment and after facing
 
01:41:00.589 --> 01:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
death we Face birth and then directly to
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
rep Perez's comment the next choice we
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
face is a gender assignment and whether
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
we are think we ought to be a boy or a
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
girl at a very young
 
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
age uh after that we Face the choice of
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
who we find
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
attractive after that we chase the
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
choice of whether to consummate that
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
after that it
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
seems uh today's reality is we decide
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
whether that ought to be a marriage
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
death and um I find this a curious order
 
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.550 align:start position:0%
death and um I find this a curious order
of

01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
events and if you go to the most recent
 
01:41:49.629 --> 01:41:49.639 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
case uh o oberfell
 
01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:56.589 align:start position:0%
case uh o oberfell
at

01:41:56.589 --> 01:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.599 --> 01:41:58.149 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
2 2590 it says a third the US Supreme
 
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
Court says a third basis for protecting
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
the right to marry is that it safeguards
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
children and families and thus draws
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
meaning from related rights of
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
childbearing procreation and education
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
going back to pierce V Society of sis uh
 
01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:19.719 align:start position:0%
sisters uh protecting religious
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
minorities so while many of view
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
marriage is a legal contract
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at line 15 here it says no
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
magistrate or minister of religion so
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
solemnize any
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
marriage I submit there are many who
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
view it not as a legal contract but a
 
01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.910 align:start position:0%
view it not as a legal contract but a
religious

01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how this bill is written
 
01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't run a foul of
 
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
oberfell both in terms of
 
01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:54.790 align:start position:0%
oberfell both in terms of
due

01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
due
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
process uh recognizing full faith and
 
01:43:01.589 --> 01:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
credit and recognizing First Amendment
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
rights and granted it may be a very tiny
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
minority but I would just urge you to
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
consider this in the broader context of
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
all of these issues and at what ages all
 
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
of these sort of events ought to occur
 
01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.350 align:start position:0%
of these sort of events ought to occur
thank

01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
you any
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
I do know that in Most states the
 
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
minister of religion is both a minister
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
of the sacrament and um a legal
 
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative of the state and I do
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
know that in those states where
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes those are in Conflict uh that
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
discussion can the minister solize
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
matrimony for the church and not be a
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative of the state when those
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
two things Clash I'll just leave that as
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
an open issue okay thank you these are
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
just things I'm hoping you'll consider
 
01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.550 align:start position:0%
just things I'm hoping you'll consider
as

01:43:57.550 --> 01:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%

extensively I want to talk about how the
 
01:44:32.669 --> 01:44:32.679 align:start position:0%
current law in Massachusetts I'm sorry
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire allowing 16 and 17
 
01:44:36.750 --> 01:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
year olds to be entered into marriage
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
actually encourages legalizes and
 
01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
incentivizes the trafficking of minors
 
01:44:44.189 --> 01:44:44.199 align:start position:0%
under the guise of marriage the way it
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
works is the federal government does not
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
specify any minimum age for marriage and
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
this is a really dangerous and gaping
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
and shameful loophole in federal law
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
that allows and encourages the
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
trafficking of minors in the US and
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
mostly it's girls who are traffi for the
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
US citizenship forced to marry adult men
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
overseas who get a visa and a path to
 
01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
citizenship it also encourages and
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
legalizes the opposite men in the US can
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
bring in traffic sex traffic girls from
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
overseas minor girls under the guise of
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
marriage and it's perfectly legal so the
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
way it works though is that USCIS and
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
the state department are allowed to
 
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
approve the petition of a spouse for a
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
spousal fiance visa involving a minor
 
01:45:31.589 --> 01:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
only if the marriage would be legal in
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
the state where the couple will reside
 
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
and that means that right now in New
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire USCIS and the state department
 
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
can approve these petitions for minors
 
01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:42.679 align:start position:0%
as young as 16 and 17 almost all of our
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
neighboring states in fact every single
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
one except for Maine has addressed this
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
problem by making the marriage age 18 no
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
exceptions because that way USCIS and
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
the state department cannot approve
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
these marriages but here in New
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our girls are not being
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
protected and this is not a small
 
01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
problem by the way the US Senate
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security committee issued a
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
report in
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
2017 that showed that in the decade
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
leading up to that report there were
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
almost 9,000 petitions for a spousal
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
fiance visa involving a minor as young
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
as 13 that were approved by USCIS and
 
01:46:19.229 --> 01:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
the younger party was a girl in 95% of
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
those cases let's catch up to the rest
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
of our uh to the rest of of our
 
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
neighbors and uh 11 states across the US
 
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
that have solved this problem by making
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
the marriage age 18 no exceptions and
 
01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
stopping the legal trafficking of
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
minors any
 
01:46:36.589 --> 01:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nelson hi thank
 
01:46:38.589 --> 01:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
my question I just I wanted to um just
 
01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
get some clarification from you
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so you're saying that even if we have
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh per
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
RSA age limitations and residency
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
limitations here in New
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already in law that the
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
Federal Government Can supersede
 
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
that so what I'm saying is the federal
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
government cannot suped the minimum age
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
but it can follow the minimum age and
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
since the minimum age now is 16 that
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
means minors at age 16 or 17 can be
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
legally trafficked because USCIS can
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
approve that if we made the marriage age
 
01:47:24.189 --> 01:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
18 the USC yes would not be able to
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
approve the uh spousal or fiance visas
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
for minors as young as 16 and 17 who are
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
being forced right now to uh marry adult
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
men overseas so they bring traffic for
 
01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
their citizenship can I please have a
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
follow follow um I believe in current
 
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
statute um both um parties have to be
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents my understanding
 
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
is that one party needs to be a New
 
01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:50.149 align:start position:0%
is that one party needs to be a New
Hampshire

01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
resident oh thank you
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
questions and Cher I wonder if I could
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
also address a question that was raised
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
before regarding emancipation so there
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
was discussion um representative panic I
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
hope that my colleague Becca explained
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
why the Emancipation that you're right
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
once you're married you're emancipated
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately those rights arrive too
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
late to help somebody who is being
 
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
forced to marry something that we see
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
almost every day at unchain at last
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
because these girls reach out to us and
 
01:48:19.709 --> 01:48:19.719 align:start position:0%
we have to say well nothing we can do
 
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
until you're married but beyond that
 
01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
actually the automatic emancipation upon
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
marriage is extremely dangerous public
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
policy because once a minor is married
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
and emancipated they lose their parents
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
financial obligation to them and
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
typically before we emancipate a minor
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire under the new
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
emancipation statute we first make them
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
prove to a court that they are
 
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient in their personal and
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
financial affairs but nobody is looking
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
at that when we're emancipating minors
 
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
just because one of their parents
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
decided it was time for them to get
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
married because this can happen with
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
just one parents consent in most cases
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
then we're forcing these minors to
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
become financially dependent on their on
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
their spouse which is a known risk
 
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
factor for domestic violence but it also
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
creates another perverse incentive for a
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
parent to force their own child to marry
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is that parents are
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
using this as a way to unilaterally
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
terminate the parental rights of the
 
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
other parent they can one parent can
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
marry off their 16 or 17-year-old
 
01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%
without even notifying the other parent
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
and then the minor is emancipated and
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
there goes that child support obligation
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
you never wanted to pay or the child
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
custody battle you want to get out of
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
and in fact what a case like this went
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
up to the Idaho Supreme Court where a
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
woman found out her AR strange husband
 
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
had paid someone money to marry their
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
16-year-old daughter so he could get out
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
of their child custody battle and she
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
lost when she fought it up to the Idaho
 
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Supreme Court said child
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
do you seeing nothing further thank you
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you please vote
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
Yes on S SP 359
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
now just a little straw poll we don't
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
have to exact this bill uh unless we all
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
want to so is there anybody who thinks
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
we should wait before we exact put your
 
01:50:05.679 --> 01:50:08.510 align:start position:0%
we should wait before we exact put your
thumb

01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
up seeing no
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
thumbs that means we can go forward to
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
exec this bill so I closed the hearing
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 359 and I now open the
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
motion I'm ready to write I don't I I
 
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
will put all the letters down even
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
though I don't say them right yes yes
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
LEC got it I move op to pass ought to
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
pass second that and Patrina patr
 
01:50:57.870 --> 01:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
you V
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
discussion I sensed on the part of a few
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
folks a little bit of hesitancy and
 
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's okay that's why we have the
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Damon thank
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
chairman um I took the time to look it
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
up uh
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
on line 12 it says no magistrate or
 
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
minister religion shall som solemnize
 
01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
the marriage doesn't say anything about
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
justices of the peace who in this state
 
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
magistrates and a Justice of the Peace
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
can solemnize a
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
marriage so there's one issue that I
 
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
have with the bill could we look at just
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
that one one would think that no justice
 
01:51:51.149 --> 01:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
of the peace May commit an act against
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
an RSA and if that person does so that
 
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
person would be subject to some
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
strictures and the ACT would be null and
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
void well doesn't say we can't do it
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
know what's your pleasure we can hold up
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.109 align:start position:0%
and the
argument

01:52:24.109 --> 01:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
argument
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
RSA and if you think you're doing it I
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
think I'm a star for the Red Sox so it
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
yeah anyone else for discussion
 
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.390 align:start position:0%
yeah anyone else for discussion
representative

01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
Bickford um the the issue of military
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
was brought thank you Mr sorry that was
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
that was wrong this is discussion I just
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
call on you oh okay um anyway military
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
was brought up for an issue and one of
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
the things in the military as I recall
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
they pay more if you have a wife or
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
spouse I should say and so they've
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
created a benefit that makes
 
01:53:16.350 --> 01:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
this uh advantageous to get married at a
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
younger age a lot of people go on the
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
service at 18 19 years old and they I'm
 
01:53:23.069 --> 01:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
going to say their girlfriend um wants
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
to be with them or at least on base and
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
like I say they get money doing this I
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
know uh my my daughter was not underage
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
but that's they get extra money for
 
01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
being married you know that's not
 
01:53:40.350 --> 01:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
something I really believe in because I
 
01:53:42.589 --> 01:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
believe in equal pay for equal work but
 
01:53:44.669 --> 01:53:44.679 align:start position:0%
that's the way the system is right now
 
01:53:44.679 --> 01:53:45.830 align:start position:0%
that's the way the system is right now
and

01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
so I I'm hesitant to change because of
 
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
that representative ofac yeah so um I
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
have researched this um I've talked to
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
many of my friends who are military
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
members I have talked to my father who's
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
military member there is no room for a
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
wife when it comes to basic training
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
when they enter into the military there
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
is no wife or spousal housing they come
 
01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
with the trunk that they are given and
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
the clothes on their back and then they
 
01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
are introduced into basic training yes
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
they do have housing but they follow a
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
chain of Comm and like the military does
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
whoever is higher up in the chain of
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
command they get that housing first and
 
01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
the military has realized that marrying
 
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
their they realized that is an issue in
 
01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
their that they're having with a lot of
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
their members um and I know I'm not sure
 
01:54:46.109 --> 01:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
if there's been discussions of it I know
 
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
that I've talked to many military
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
members who have said that that is an
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
issue that they're trying to face right
 
01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
now of military members especially their
 
01:54:59.310 --> 01:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
younger boys marrying off just to get
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
benefits When in fact there those
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
especially with the pregnant girls um
 
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
the girls that are pregnant um they have
 
01:55:13.229 --> 01:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
found other there's better ways to go
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
about it than just mirring off just for
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
benefits I think that's and also if they
 
01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
find that they are marrying just for the
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
benefits then they will be court
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
marshaled and handle the way that the
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
military will handle it they don't just
 
01:55:31.709 --> 01:55:31.719 align:start position:0%
let anybody get married just to get more
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
money they tend to have checks and
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
balances in that military to
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
prevent members just to receive more pay
 
01:55:44.669 --> 01:55:44.679 align:start position:0%
just from having a ring on their finger
 
01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
rep Vice chairman
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah this is this is the these
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
discussions qualify why I believe that
 
01:55:58.069 --> 01:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
nobody should be married under the age
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
of 18 I mean we're having a discussion
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
about a person going at the service that
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
may get another 20 bucks a week if he's
 
01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
married so we're gonna you know so let's
 
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
incentivize that underage marriage so
 
01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
somebody entering the service could get
 
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
extra 20 bucks or whatever they get I'm
 
01:56:20.669 --> 01:56:20.679 align:start position:0%
sure it's not very much um you know and
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
then we have the discussion on um you
 
01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
know other other discussions on nothing
 
01:56:29.069 --> 01:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
to do with marriage and the sanctity of
 
01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
it but just an an advantage uh that's
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
why I you know I'm sticking with if
 
01:56:37.709 --> 01:56:37.719 align:start position:0%
you're not 18 years old you're not
 
01:56:37.719 --> 01:56:42.229 align:start position:0%
you're not 18 years old you're not
getting

01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
married representative
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman so just to
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
kind of follow up on that it's called so
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
what happens in the military is you get
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
um a one-time bump when you add a
 
01:56:59.069 --> 01:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
dependent it is not when you get married
 
01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's when you add a dependent so that
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
dependent could be a spouse but it could
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
also be a a
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
child um and it it's interesting that
 
01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
we're having this discussion and I'm I'm
 
01:57:12.069 --> 01:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
reminded of um one of the
 
01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
representatives who spoke who pointed
 
01:57:16.030 --> 01:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
out that we allow only samesex marriage
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
starting at 18 so if you have a gay
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
military member at 17 who has gotten
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
permission from his parents to join the
 
01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
military and they want to get married
 
01:57:26.589 --> 01:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
now so that they can have that spousal
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
benefit they're not allowed to they're
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
only allowed to do it if it's opposite
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
sex apparently so to me for the fraction
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
of a percent of individuals who this
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
might apply to it's not a reason to put
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
in danger all of the other individuals
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
who are at risk of child trafficking um
 
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
and again the the bump is a onetime
 
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
thing when you add a dependent um under
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
their I for what it's called the it's
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
their enrollment system it's the acronym
 
01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
is deers but I don't remember what all
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
the the letters stand for but basically
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's adding your dependence to their
 
01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
system and it's for base housing
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.119 --> 01:58:13.669 align:start position:0%
 
increase

01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:58:13.679 --> 01:58:17.990 align:start position:0%
increase
representative

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.990 --> 01:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
Gord representative Gabby grossan
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
see at least it's the same first
 
01:58:29.709 --> 01:58:29.719 align:start position:0%
letter the first letter know thank you
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.149 --> 01:58:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.109 --> 01:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
worse thank you
 
01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
um so this is my third term here and um
 
01:58:49.709 --> 01:58:49.719 align:start position:0%
this has been discussed since my first
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
term with um representative Cassie L
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward for us um and I
 
01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely support this
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um going round and round it
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
it my head you know we're putting kids
 
01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:10.719 align:start position:0%
at risk we're putting young adults at
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
risk so whatever benefit May
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
outweigh whether it's a bump and pay or
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
what housing whatever it may
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
be the effect on our
 
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
society when we have
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
traumatized individuals that have
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
experienced trauma
 
01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:36.790 align:start position:0%
experienced trauma
and

01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:39.629 --> 01:59:39.639 align:start position:0%
coercion that's going to affect us down
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
the road
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
um the other piece that's always come up
 
01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
is this notion
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
that a young person under 18 can can't
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
access help if they're in a domestic
 
01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:57.470 align:start position:0%
access help if they're in a domestic
violence

01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
situation that has continuously come up
 
02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
over and over being turned away from
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
from support and help because they're a
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
minor not being able to get a lawyer I
 
02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
remember our first term it was I don't
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
think you could get a hotel
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
room as you know you couldn't get a
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
hotel room so but you could get married
 
02:00:24.990 --> 02:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
um so once again here we are and I'll be
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
voting um in support of raising the
 
02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
you the chair wishes to thank Gabby M
 
02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
Grossman for her
 
02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
contribution and now the uh chair
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Greg thank you
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I think you know there's
 
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of things when we look
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and and between the house bill
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
that we had um this last year and then
 
02:00:58.030 --> 02:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
this bill you know we're always looking
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
at you know a what type of kiddo in this
 
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
day and age is getting married that
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
early and we always go back to these
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
abuse things and and I think there's a
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
another thing that we're kind of missing
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
here and I know that the New Hampshire
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
way is we have our own little unique way
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
of doing things and that's that's
 
02:01:16.109 --> 02:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
usually pretty great when we start to
 
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
see all the states around us um passing
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
these these marriage laws where we're
 
02:01:23.069 --> 02:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
going to 18 what does that make us it
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't make us the outlier who needs to
 
02:01:26.830 --> 02:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
play catchup what it makes us is it
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
makes us more attractive who is it
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
making us more attractive too it's
 
02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
making us more attractive to these
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
traffickers yes we've only had so many
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
marriages in this last year but let's
 
02:01:40.030 --> 02:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
look at it we have a ntion international
 
02:01:42.910 --> 02:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
problem of trafficking especially with
 
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
internet especially with kids having
 
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
their phones and being able to get
 
02:01:49.149 --> 02:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
online and meet up with people and stuff
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
we will make ourselves a very attractive
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
state for child traffickers to come so
 
02:01:56.669 --> 02:01:56.679 align:start position:0%
even though we haven't seen that yet
 
02:01:58.350 --> 02:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
that's something to keep in mind when we
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
are one of the only islands on this
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
particular matter so I will be voting
 
02:02:04.589 --> 02:02:04.599 align:start position:0%
for this for a million different reasons
 
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
but that's an added one thank
 
02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
Nelson um I'm feeling ambivalent right
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
now one way or the other but my concern
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
is that um is
 
02:02:23.550 --> 02:02:23.560 align:start position:0%
this we have such a large larger problem
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
with um human trafficking sex
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
trafficking of minors and raising the
 
02:02:33.069 --> 02:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
age of marriage to 18 is not going to
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
solve that and also in domestic violence
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
situations of minors who are
 
02:02:42.990 --> 02:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
cohabitating so I am hoping that my
 
02:02:45.550 --> 02:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues will join
 
02:02:48.669 --> 02:02:48.679 align:start position:0%
me should we be reelected next time to
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
actually address the real problem that
 
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
you well my comment is uh when I was
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
young I visited my family in rural
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
Canada a little town called pearsonville
 
02:03:06.239 --> 02:03:07.149 align:start position:0%
Canada a little town called pearsonville
New

02:03:07.149 --> 02:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
Brunswick and at 14 people were
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
responsible they did not have
 
02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
adolescence you grew up quickly because
 
02:03:19.709 --> 02:03:19.719 align:start position:0%
the cow had to be milked the absence of
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
Which is far more serious than you
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
didn't take out the trash every other
 
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
day and I noticed my cousins in Canada
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
were because of this much more mature
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so to get married at 15 and 16 was
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
not a maturity
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
problem well that's not the people I see
 
02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere else I go even in rural
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
Canada as a result what might have been
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay there 60 years ago I do not believe
 
02:03:59.549 --> 02:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
is okay here now and so I will be voting
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:04:05.069 --> 02:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
bill anyone else yes representative
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson um I
 
02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
will admit that I voted against this
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
bill last year however um times have
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
changed in a very short period of time
 
02:04:20.109 --> 02:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm very concerned that a same-sex
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
marriage is required to be 18 but we're
 
02:04:24.669 --> 02:04:24.679 align:start position:0%
not providing those same protections to
 
02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
the young women in our state um I will
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.189 --> 02:04:34.199 align:start position:0%

02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.000 align:start position:0%

02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%

um have life experience with
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
um basically um I was only 15 years old
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
and my ex-husband he was 47 years
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
old um and someone who didn't know the
 
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
language uh someone who didn't know the
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
rights um I had 11 years
 
02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
of trauma pain and um
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
struggles um and I don't wish anyone
 
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
because those scars um even though that
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
I feel like I heal um they're going to
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
be there for the rest of my life um and
 
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
I don't wish anyone not even my worst
 
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:36.760 align:start position:0%

03:03:39.070 --> 03:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services uh by anually
 
03:03:41.750 --> 03:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the way it's stated in the statute
 
03:03:44.590 --> 03:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
now the dates of reporting are uh
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
January 1st and July 1st we request that
 
03:03:49.950 --> 03:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
the bill be amended as the language
 
03:03:53.309 --> 03:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
dates in Senate Bill 498 to align itself
 
03:03:55.870 --> 03:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
with the federal reporting dates of the
 
03:03:58.229 --> 03:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice delinquency prevention
 
03:04:00.309 --> 03:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
act which would change the dates uh
 
03:04:04.670 --> 03:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
reporting to October 1st and April 1st
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
and lastly uh this bill on page three
 
03:04:11.349 --> 03:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
which is uh section 10 of the bill uh
 
03:04:16.469 --> 03:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
lines 14 through 19 this bill would
 
03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
repeal the perspective repeal of the
 
03:04:22.950 --> 03:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
section known as the rebuttable
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm that went into
 
03:04:27.269 --> 03:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
effect in
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
2021 with House Bill 1162 that had a
 
03:04:35.110 --> 03:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
sunset provision of July first of this
 
03:04:38.150 --> 03:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
year of 2024 so this bill would be
 
03:04:42.510 --> 03:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
repealing the repeal of that sunset
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
provision we have asked for that because
 
03:04:46.349 --> 03:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
we find that the rebuttable presumption
 
03:04:49.150 --> 03:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
of harm is a very important evidentiary
 
03:04:52.710 --> 03:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
tool it is trauma informed with all that
 
03:04:56.590 --> 03:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
we know about Early Childhood adverse
 
03:04:58.990 --> 03:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
effects it does not change the
 
03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
definition of neglect that's why it's an
 
03:05:04.590 --> 03:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
evidentiary tool under 169
 
03:05:07.150 --> 03:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
C12 the definition of neglect Remains
 
03:05:10.110 --> 03:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
the Same it's a two-prong definition in
 
03:05:14.990 --> 03:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
which a child is a neglected child is a
 
03:05:18.269 --> 03:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
who is without proper care necessary for
 
03:05:21.269 --> 03:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
the child's physical mental or emotional
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
well-being and then that second prong is
 
03:05:26.229 --> 03:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
that when it is established that a child
 
03:05:28.870 --> 03:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
has suffered serious impairment or is
 
03:05:32.309 --> 03:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
likely to suffer serious impairment I
 
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a mouthful and there's
 
03:05:36.429 --> 03:05:36.439 align:start position:0%
many elements involved with uh what
 
03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
factors uh the court is to consider when
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
looking at serious
 
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
impairments and the Supreme Court has
 
03:05:46.269 --> 03:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
has simplified it to be harm harm to a
 
03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
child or potential harm arm to a child
 
03:05:51.630 --> 03:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
and that's the hard part sometimes in
 
03:05:53.590 --> 03:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
court because that's not in line with
 
03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
what we know about Early Childhood
 
03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
adverse effects and that harm occurred
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
but it may not immediately manifest
 
03:06:05.190 --> 03:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
itself it may not be readily apparent to
 
03:06:07.630 --> 03:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
a child who has been exposed to certain
 
03:06:10.750 --> 03:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
situation and experiences in their home
 
03:06:10.760 --> 03:06:11.630 align:start position:0%
situation and experiences in their home
and

03:06:11.630 --> 03:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:14.190 --> 03:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
therefore that would prevent sometimes
 
03:06:17.269 --> 03:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
the state from acting from intervening
 
03:06:20.349 --> 03:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
or delay intervention waiting for that
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
harm to manifest itself and that's not
 
03:06:24.750 --> 03:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
in line what what we all as a society
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
know about Early Childhood adverse
 
03:06:30.670 --> 03:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
effects and therefore four years ago as
 
03:06:32.190 --> 03:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
legislature heard testimony from many
 
03:06:37.710 --> 03:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
entities including um a review of the
 
03:06:40.910 --> 03:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
federal review of cases that were not uh
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
acted upon and saw that consistently
 
03:06:45.070 --> 03:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
those were the ones that were considered
 
03:06:48.110 --> 03:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
to be exposure cases when children were
 
03:06:51.309 --> 03:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
exposed to certain conditions in the
 
03:06:53.950 --> 03:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
home and those conditions put them at
 
03:06:56.990 --> 03:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
risk of serious impairment so therefore
 
03:06:59.950 --> 03:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1162 which did a lot of great
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
things for child welfare it finally
 
03:07:06.309 --> 03:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
defined psychological melt treatment it
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
finally included a stepparent as a
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
parent of a child and it included four
 
03:07:17.309 --> 03:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumptions of harm in which
 
03:07:19.870 --> 03:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
the the court may make a finding that a
 
03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
child has been harmed a rebuttable
 
03:07:24.269 --> 03:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
presumption that this child has been
 
03:07:26.910 --> 03:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
harmed unless in until proven otherwise
 
03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
to certain exposure cases and that is
 
03:07:31.630 --> 03:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
when a child is exposed to substance
 
03:07:34.229 --> 03:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
misuse in the home that is adversely
 
03:07:37.110 --> 03:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
affecting the care of the child when a
 
03:07:39.670 --> 03:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
child is exposed to driving while
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
intoxicated by being in the car with a
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
parent who is driving while impaired
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
three when a child is exposed osed to
 
03:07:51.429 --> 03:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
physical violence in the home by the
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
parent the parent is either physically
 
03:07:56.070 --> 03:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh violent towards another child in the
 
03:07:58.469 --> 03:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
home or another adult in the home and
 
03:08:01.790 --> 03:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
that child is exposed to that and lastly
 
03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
when a child is exposed to psychological
 
03:08:07.070 --> 03:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
melt treatment either they themselves
 
03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
are the victim of psychological melt
 
03:08:11.429 --> 03:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
treatment or they are exposed to psych
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
psychological M treatment in the home to
 
03:08:16.870 --> 03:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
another adult or another child in the
 
03:08:19.229 --> 03:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
home and that is a very important
 
03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
evidentiary tool that we hope with the
 
03:08:23.870 --> 03:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill uh that you pass
 
03:08:27.070 --> 03:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
this bill to repeal the repeal of that
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
those rebuttable presumptions of
 
03:08:31.750 --> 03:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
harm and I be happy to answer any
 
03:08:34.590 --> 03:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill under those
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
four three of them are very discreet
 
03:08:40.950 --> 03:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
situations but I question about
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
psychological maltreatment how broadly
 
03:08:45.990 --> 03:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
could that be taken for example the
 
03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
child really wants something and the
 
03:08:52.229 --> 03:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
parent parents for whatever reason do
 
03:08:54.550 --> 03:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
not believe that the child should have
 
03:08:58.469 --> 03:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
that uh we're talking major things um
 
03:09:00.590 --> 03:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
would that be considered psychological
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
maltreatment and the child could say I
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to have tattoos and my parents
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
forbad me and because of that I am
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
suffering uh to me psychological Mal
 
03:09:16.229 --> 03:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
treatment could be it could be runaway
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
if I may with House Bill 1162 the
 
03:09:20.950 --> 03:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
definition of psychological Mel
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
treatment was added to the definition
 
03:09:27.950 --> 03:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
section of 169 C3 and if you could give
 
03:09:31.110 --> 03:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
me a moment I believe I did bring the
 
03:09:33.950 --> 03:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
actual statute with me well if you
 
03:09:45.469 --> 03:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
perfect I can go so before I joined DCF
 
03:09:51.630 --> 03:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
as a as a uh general counsel I worked
 
03:09:55.389 --> 03:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
for UNH and I was um a trainer and after
 
03:09:57.750 --> 03:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
1162 was passed and included the
 
03:09:59.750 --> 03:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
provision that all dcyf and other
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders be trained on House Bill
 
03:10:04.830 --> 03:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
1162 and I was actually a trainer of
 
03:10:07.349 --> 03:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
that so I will refer to my PRI previous
 
03:10:09.229 --> 03:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
notes on the trainings that were some
 
03:10:16.309 --> 03:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:16.319 --> 03:10:46.229 align:start position:0%
 
definition

03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:46.239 --> 03:10:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:10:50.830 --> 03:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
it defines cycle the law the statute of
 
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
1162 added to the definition of
 
03:10:57.389 --> 03:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
psychological Mal treatment and was
 
03:10:59.790 --> 03:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
added into the law of pervasive and
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
emotionally abusive Behavior which shall
 
03:11:05.590 --> 03:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
include but not be limited to patterns
 
03:11:09.070 --> 03:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
of threatening berating or demeaning
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
Behavior so it's a course of conduct of
 
03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
behavior that is threatening berating or
 
03:11:16.870 --> 03:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
demeaning parents being parents and
 
03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
saying know you cannot do that would not
 
03:11:21.429 --> 03:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
fall under any of those unless the
 
03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
language used and so it becomes a
 
03:11:26.830 --> 03:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
berating language or physical
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
threatening language correct because as
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
we know uh you know emotional abuse and
 
03:11:34.150 --> 03:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
words have sometimes a lot more effects
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
on a child than oh sure but sometimes
 
03:11:38.150 --> 03:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
saying no a child can perceive that of
 
03:11:40.870 --> 03:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
course and that's why I think um you all
 
03:11:42.550 --> 03:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
if anyone was present during the house
 
03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill 1162 took all of that in
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
consideration and talked about pervasive
 
03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
and emotionally abusive Behavior yeah I
 
03:11:51.070 --> 03:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
was a co-sponsor to that so I just want
 
03:11:53.550 --> 03:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure I didn't uh you know open
 
03:11:56.550 --> 03:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
up something representative
 
03:11:58.990 --> 03:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
dmon thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:12:02.269 --> 03:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so when I raised
 
03:12:05.070 --> 03:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
my children I had a sign on the
 
03:12:07.150 --> 03:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
refrigerator that I replaced frequently
 
03:12:08.830 --> 03:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
because I had to get the Jelly stains
 
03:12:13.309 --> 03:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
off and it said um Sticks and Stones can
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
break your bones but words can break
 
03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:15.950 align:start position:0%
break your bones but words can break
your

03:12:15.950 --> 03:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:12:18.269 --> 03:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
heart and I always said to the children
 
03:12:20.830 --> 03:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
be careful how you speak to somebody so
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
I found
 
03:12:26.229 --> 03:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
it diff difficult for myself when I
 
03:12:28.389 --> 03:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
reported somebody for calling their
 
03:12:31.990 --> 03:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
child an effing moronic
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
idiot and when I reported it as abuse I
 
03:12:39.550 --> 03:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
was told sorry so it seems like this
 
03:12:42.590 --> 03:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
bill am I correct that this bill will
 
03:12:46.229 --> 03:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
make a corrective action in that aspect
 
03:12:49.830 --> 03:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
when you're const L verbally Bering and
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
telling a child that they are not what
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
they what you are telling them they
 
03:12:57.910 --> 03:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
are exactly because it's patterns of
 
03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
threatening berading or demeaning
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
Behavior so in the court of law that' be
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
very hard to prove that a child has been
 
03:13:06.429 --> 03:13:06.439 align:start position:0%
harmed without this rebuttable
 
03:13:09.190 --> 03:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
presumption of
 
03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
harm about time thank you representative
 
03:13:15.309 --> 03:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:13:16.590 --> 03:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my call do you have any
 
03:13:20.309 --> 03:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
um why um what was the sorry I'm What
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
would I'm just wondering it's baffling
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
what was the reason for uh the repeal of
 
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
that that's a good question I don't know
 
03:13:36.790 --> 03:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
actually the origin of why it has sunset
 
03:13:39.550 --> 03:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
provision in it um I know that these
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption of harms the four
 
03:13:44.590 --> 03:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
of them replaced the opioid um
 
03:13:47.269 --> 03:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption that had a sun
 
03:13:50.269 --> 03:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
set so I don't know if that's why it was
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
replacing another provision that did
 
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
Sunset but other than that I would be
 
03:13:55.160 --> 03:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
Sunset but other than that I would be
only

03:13:56.790 --> 03:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:13:56.800 --> 03:13:58.910 align:start position:0%
only
guessing

03:13:58.910 --> 03:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
guessing
 
03:14:01.510 --> 03:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:14:05.229 --> 03:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
question um I actually wanted to just go
 
03:14:07.950 --> 03:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
back to um the first and second parts of
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
the bills can you just um explain
 
03:14:12.830 --> 03:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
fictive Ken and what that legal
 
03:14:15.070 --> 03:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
definition is for us just because it's
 
03:14:17.229 --> 03:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
something new since I worked at dcyf
 
03:14:17.239 --> 03:14:18.469 align:start position:0%
something new since I worked at dcyf
years

03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
ago I can uh fictive kin is defined in
 
03:14:29.550 --> 03:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
17025 Roman numeral 8 in which kin means
 
03:14:32.670 --> 03:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
a child means a child or children who
 
03:14:34.750 --> 03:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
for which there is a connection or
 
03:14:37.429 --> 03:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
history between a child or their parents
 
03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
and another responsible adult including
 
03:14:42.830 --> 03:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
but not incl not limited to a relative
 
03:14:45.469 --> 03:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
or related adult so someone known to the
 
03:14:47.550 --> 03:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
child it can be a relative but doesn't
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
have to be a relative it can be a coach
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
it can be a teacher it can be a
 
03:14:58.910 --> 03:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
great the yes representative
 
03:15:04.750 --> 03:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson thank
 
03:15:06.389 --> 03:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
you for your time and coming to answer
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
our questions
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
um there's something about this that's
 
03:15:15.469 --> 03:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
just not sitting right with me um at the
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
current moment because you're saying
 
03:15:20.189 --> 03:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
threatening Bering and demeaning which
 
03:15:22.269 --> 03:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
is which are all very subjective which
 
03:15:24.349 --> 03:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
means we're placing our values on
 
03:15:27.309 --> 03:15:27.319 align:start position:0%
another family without even the evidence
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
that there is harm being done I know
 
03:15:32.070 --> 03:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
that I understand that over the long run
 
03:15:33.870 --> 03:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
you know children we all have stories
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
about what our parents might have done
 
03:15:39.429 --> 03:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
to us um but I'm concerned and I'm just
 
03:15:41.910 --> 03:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
wondering how does this
 
03:15:45.910 --> 03:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
fit um when you talk about psychological
 
03:15:45.920 --> 03:15:47.710 align:start position:0%
fit um when you talk about psychological
maltreatment

03:15:47.710 --> 03:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
maltreatment
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
where does parents that have diagnosed
 
03:15:53.950 --> 03:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
mental illness of by maybe borderline
 
03:15:56.510 --> 03:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
personality or bipolar
 
03:15:59.229 --> 03:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
disorder is this going to
 
03:16:02.349 --> 03:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
unfairly impact them because that's how
 
03:16:03.950 --> 03:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
they could tend to treat their children
 
03:16:05.550 --> 03:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
with a lot of threatening behavior or
 
03:16:08.469 --> 03:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
Bering or um especially with a about one
 
03:16:10.269 --> 03:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
minute they're they're happy go-lucky
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
parents and the next minute they're
 
03:16:13.710 --> 03:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
screaming at their children so I'm just
 
03:16:15.550 --> 03:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
wondering how is this going to affect
 
03:16:18.710 --> 03:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
our community that is diagnosed and is
 
03:16:21.030 --> 03:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
that going to stop people from getting
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
from getting help for their um mental
 
03:16:23.279 --> 03:16:25.030 align:start position:0%
from getting help for their um mental
health

03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:16:27.070 --> 03:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
issues thank you for the question well
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
first of all it's twofold the rebuttable
 
03:16:32.349 --> 03:16:32.359 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm is applying
 
03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
psychological Mel treatment that
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
definition is is defined in the
 
03:16:41.630 --> 03:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
definition section of 169 C3 and that is
 
03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
not part of the repeal the repeal is the
 
03:16:46.469 --> 03:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption of harm and again
 
03:16:48.469 --> 03:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
it's a rebuttable presumption it's not
 
03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
an irrebuttable presumption of harm so
 
03:16:53.790 --> 03:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
if there's testimony that the parent was
 
03:16:57.150 --> 03:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um calling a child a a
 
03:17:00.510 --> 03:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
derogatory name in terms of calling them
 
03:17:03.110 --> 03:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh obese and what that means to be
 
03:17:04.750 --> 03:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
calling them obese and did certain
 
03:17:06.830 --> 03:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
actions because they called them obese
 
03:17:10.429 --> 03:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
or uh did other forms of emotional abuse
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's a rebuttable presumption it's not
 
03:17:15.429 --> 03:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
irrebuttable until unless proven
 
03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise it just makes it easier to
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
prove harm but it's not saying it is
 
03:17:21.750 --> 03:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
harm in and of
 
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
itself followup follow
 
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
up so just to to make sure I'm getting
 
03:17:29.309 --> 03:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
this clear so I understand that it's a
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
rebuttable but it's also presenting an
 
03:17:34.830 --> 03:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for parents to go after each
 
03:17:38.269 --> 03:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
other in making claims against the other
 
03:17:40.630 --> 03:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
parent for what they would perceive as
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
mistreatment or
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm just I guess I'm I'm worried
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
about this subjectiveness of it of
 
03:17:51.150 --> 03:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
especially when it's something that
 
03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing it's just something
 
03:17:54.670 --> 03:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
maybe I wouldn't particularly raise my
 
03:17:56.830 --> 03:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
children doing it one way so I'm I'm
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
trying to understand and square this
 
03:18:00.670 --> 03:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
whole thing is how do
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
we one is how do you prove it but also
 
03:18:06.670 --> 03:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
how do you disprove an
 
03:18:08.469 --> 03:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
allegation well I think you have to also
 
03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
start the foundation of that all
 
03:18:13.189 --> 03:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
evidence in court has to be material
 
03:18:16.510 --> 03:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
reliable and found to be credible for it
 
03:18:19.510 --> 03:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
to be found to even apply the rebble
 
03:18:22.189 --> 03:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm so typically say for
 
03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
instance if there's a child who goes to
 
03:18:27.229 --> 03:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
the Child Advocacy Center and has a
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
forensic interview in which the child
 
03:18:32.750 --> 03:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
describes acts of the parent that is
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
emotionally abusive and berading and
 
03:18:36.790 --> 03:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
that is evidence that's material
 
03:18:38.590 --> 03:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
evidence it's reliable evidence it's
 
03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
credible evidence that the state would
 
03:18:43.389 --> 03:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
put into evidence during an abuse and
 
03:18:46.830 --> 03:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
neglect action for psychological melt
 
03:18:48.990 --> 03:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
treatment and that evidence is weighed
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
by the judge so doesn't doesn't change
 
03:18:52.670 --> 03:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
like I said it before it doesn't first
 
03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the um evidence of
 
03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
putting in reliable credible evidence
 
03:19:01.630 --> 03:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
it's just that once that evidence is
 
03:19:04.510 --> 03:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
ruled to be reliable and
 
03:19:07.469 --> 03:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
credible uh admissible evidence then the
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
judge weighs that with the evidentiary
 
03:19:14.070 --> 03:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
tool of a rebuttable presumption of

03:19:21.309 --> 03:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
and and thank you very much chairman uh
 
03:19:23.110 --> 03:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is John Williams
 
03:19:24.590 --> 03:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'm the legislative director for Health
 
03:19:26.469 --> 03:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
Human Services and just here to
 
03:19:28.150 --> 03:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
compliment the testimony that's being
 
03:19:31.150 --> 03:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
provided to you very astute uh testimony
 
03:19:34.349 --> 03:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
um from attorney larby uh I actually was
 
03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
involved with the underlying Bill
 
03:19:36.990 --> 03:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
working with many of you on the
 
03:19:39.269 --> 03:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
committee that dealt with the rebuttable
 
03:19:41.710 --> 03:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
presumption around harm what I wanted to
 
03:19:43.229 --> 03:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
clarify particularly for you represent
 
03:19:45.510 --> 03:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
ball that is actually currently in law
 
03:19:47.469 --> 03:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
today and the reason the sunset
 
03:19:49.870 --> 03:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
provision was placed into the bill was
 
03:19:51.349 --> 03:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
primarily at the request of the
 
03:19:53.429 --> 03:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
pediatricians in from Dartmouth and
 
03:19:54.990 --> 03:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
other areas because they were concerned
 
03:19:56.830 --> 03:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
about the perhaps chilling effect that
 
03:20:00.030 --> 03:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
would have in terms of reporting uh in
 
03:20:02.070 --> 03:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
cases where a parent might have a
 
03:20:05.389 --> 03:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
subance a subance use um matter and so
 
03:20:06.429 --> 03:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
we have worked with them very
 
03:20:08.030 --> 03:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
collaboratively you heard from attorney
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
larby about the training that we've done
 
03:20:11.189 --> 03:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
for the interpretation to making sure
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
that we're very sensitive because we
 
03:20:15.150 --> 03:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
want people to address their subs use
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
issues and also we want to make sure
 
03:20:18.550 --> 03:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
that kids are safe and I think we've
 
03:20:20.990 --> 03:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
done a really good job balancing the the
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
um whole perspective of the current law
 
03:20:25.469 --> 03:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
now the sunset was put in here
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
specifically for this to be rot tested
 
03:20:28.910 --> 03:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying because you don't
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
hear clamors of hundreds of people
 
03:20:32.950 --> 03:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
behind us that that is evidence because
 
03:20:35.550 --> 03:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
that's kind of lack of evidence uh but
 
03:20:37.189 --> 03:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
it is an occasion where this has been
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
rot tested and gone through the process
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're here today to
 
03:20:43.150 --> 03:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
request this committee to remove the
 
03:20:45.429 --> 03:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
sunset provision again the issues that
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
you're you're discussing are are in
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
current law there not this is nothing
 
03:20:50.550 --> 03:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
new that this bill is trying to do it's
 
03:20:53.550 --> 03:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
just eliminating the sunset provision in
 
03:20:55.349 --> 03:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
the law because it is working and it is
 
03:20:57.229 --> 03:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
protecting kids and if it isn't working
 
03:20:58.830 --> 03:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
in the future you will certainly have
 
03:21:00.349 --> 03:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
folks coming before you seeking other
 
03:21:01.710 --> 03:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
changes of law but we're not trying to
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
change at all and I'll repeat we're not
 
03:21:05.630 --> 03:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
trying to change at all the current
 
03:21:07.070 --> 03:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
provisions of the law as it relates to
 
03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
the um rebuttable uh proof of harm so
 
03:21:12.030 --> 03:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
attorney larby
 
03:21:14.830 --> 03:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
anything I have a question um some of
 
03:21:17.790 --> 03:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
you may remember House Bill 5
 
03:21:21.630 --> 03:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
1973 which was about outplacement of
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
children who needed to be placed
 
03:21:26.389 --> 03:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere and there
 
03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
was there were hours upon hours upon
 
03:21:33.309 --> 03:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
hours of work that went into that by the
 
03:21:35.349 --> 03:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate and
 
03:21:37.469 --> 03:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:21:41.710 --> 03:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
and one poor legislator who really
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
wonders um please tell me that this 498
 
03:21:50.229 --> 03:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
is in is in a different place it is not
 
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
um dealing with 1573 or it's Senate
 
03:21:57.990 --> 03:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
cousin I think it's 417 this is uh
 
03:22:00.309 --> 03:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
something different
 
03:22:04.030 --> 03:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
correct thank you yeah and and I don't
 
03:22:06.110 --> 03:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
say the same word uh chairman that you
 
03:22:07.790 --> 03:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
also say about certain types of bills
 
03:22:09.510 --> 03:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
and I probably met a couple of your
 
03:22:11.070 --> 03:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
folks returning from lunch that I did
 
03:22:13.510 --> 03:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
this uh this truly is one of those bills
 
03:22:16.189 --> 03:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
that were coming back again the Fred kin
 
03:22:18.110 --> 03:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
very helpful pieces around Family First
 
03:22:21.189 --> 03:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
putting that into legislation changing a
 
03:22:23.550 --> 03:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
the date for reporting for detention
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
from January 1st to October uh are the
 
03:22:28.750 --> 03:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
periods that we had under the federal
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
and then finally just seeking not any
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
change to current law as it relates to
 
03:22:34.269 --> 03:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
rebuttal Pro for harm but just uh
 
03:22:36.150 --> 03:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
addressing the sunset provision if we do
 
03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
if you do nothing here today what will
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
end up happening is that it is scheduled
 
03:22:42.590 --> 03:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
a sunset on June 30th of of this year
 
03:22:44.510 --> 03:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we're here very
 
03:22:46.710 --> 03:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully to saying it's working it's
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
been Road tested and if there's any
 
03:22:50.110 --> 03:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
other changes needed people will come to
 
03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
you our only goal here is to address the
 
03:22:52.319 --> 03:22:54.429 align:start position:0%
you our only goal here is to address the
sunset

03:22:54.429 --> 03:22:54.439 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
03:22:59.150 --> 03:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
further thank you counselor and thank
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%

this now ends the hearing on Senate Bill
 
03:23:11.469 --> 03:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
498 and uh we're done we're done where
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
card that's not the
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
point the question is we usually have
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
the cards do you have something you want
 
03:23:21.680 --> 03:23:23.030 align:start position:0%
the cards do you have something you want
to

03:23:23.030 --> 03:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%

Leon I represent the town of dairy um I
 
03:23:58.110 --> 03:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
come to speak to you about my concern
 
03:24:00.189 --> 03:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
about um one particular phrase that is
 
03:24:03.070 --> 03:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
included in here fictive kin um my
 
03:24:05.150 --> 03:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
concern around that is as I was looking
 
03:24:06.550 --> 03:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
through the statutes I know it was
 
03:24:08.750 --> 03:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
referenced but I did not find it in our
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
existing statutes and I also um am just
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
quite concerned about the possibility of
 
03:24:16.990 --> 03:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
placing children
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
with somebody who may not may have an
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriate relationship with them and
 
03:24:24.790 --> 03:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
may be in a position of authority um my
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
mother was a public school teacher and
 
03:24:31.469 --> 03:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
um the only way that they found out that
 
03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
there was a teacher who had Decades of
 
03:24:34.990 --> 03:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate relationships with
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
children was after the teacher's lounge
 
03:24:40.030 --> 03:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
was vandalized in a horrific way because
 
03:24:41.950 --> 03:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
the same thing had happened to one Boy's
 
03:24:44.550 --> 03:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
brother that had happened to him until
 
03:24:46.590 --> 03:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
that day that teacher was well- loved
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
and well respected but they found out
 
03:24:50.550 --> 03:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
that there had been a pattern of abuse
 
03:24:53.189 --> 03:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
over decades um my concern is simply
 
03:24:55.870 --> 03:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
around the fictive kin I recognize the
 
03:24:57.510 --> 03:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that there are people
 
03:24:59.469 --> 03:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
who are important to a child who are
 
03:25:02.030 --> 03:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
involved when I first heard about this I
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
asked what's victed of King kin oh that
 
03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
must be Uncle Mike my husband's best
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
friend from growing up who is the one
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
who will be raising our children should
 
03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
something happen to us um and we have
 
03:25:15.630 --> 03:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
that in documentation I know not
 
03:25:18.910 --> 03:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else does but my caution here
 
03:25:20.990 --> 03:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
is that there are people who are
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
involved in children's lives there's one
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
from my town who had been um an
 
03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
assistant at a school and she has
 
03:25:28.910 --> 03:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
another parole hearing coming up she had
 
03:25:30.670 --> 03:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
an inappropriate relationship with one
 
03:25:32.469 --> 03:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
of the students what if he had been
 
03:25:34.630 --> 03:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
placed in that house um the horrors that
 
03:25:36.309 --> 03:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
had happened there would have been even
 
03:25:39.070 --> 03:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
worse so I had just some caution on
 
03:25:40.990 --> 03:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
expanding the ease of placement in
 
03:25:44.070 --> 03:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
fictive kin because you know I'd say
 
03:25:48.150 --> 03:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
probably 99,900 99 out of 10,000 people
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
who would be in that situation are good
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
but we need to be sure that that balance

03:25:57.309 --> 03:25:57.319 align:start position:0%
inappropriate relationship with somebody
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
in a position of power isn't something
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%

Fire any questions for vice chair Leon
representative

03:26:07.189 --> 03:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:26:09.630 --> 03:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um do you
 
03:26:15.910 --> 03:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
believe that there are also um people
 
03:26:18.469 --> 03:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
who are relatives and
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
Guardians um who also are abusers and
 
03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's already in law that they would
 
03:26:28.510 --> 03:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
be able to be responsible for this
 
03:26:31.389 --> 03:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
child's care yes and that was one of the
 
03:26:33.389 --> 03:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
challenges and tragedies that faces
 
03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
especially this committee dealing with
 
03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
those difficulties because you can't you
 
03:26:40.710 --> 03:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
need to treat everybody fairly and
 
03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's bad people that are
 
03:26:45.189 --> 03:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
able to disguise how they act um and
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's the challenge if this was easy all
 
03:26:49.229 --> 03:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
these kids would be safe um and I
 
03:26:50.750 --> 03:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
commend you guys for everything you do
 
03:26:53.269 --> 03:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
in order to protect children followup
 
03:26:58.630 --> 03:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
please followup so um with that
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
um with that being said I think it's
 
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
logical that um we would have to treat
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
everybody in in uh that's presently in
 
03:27:10.590 --> 03:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
statute and also fictive kin in the same
 
03:27:14.750 --> 03:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
way um in order to uh vet them equally
 
03:27:18.590 --> 03:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
because we would have to to um view all
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
of them as uh you know potentially
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
either very good equally or harmfully
 
03:27:28.990 --> 03:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
potentially um so how would you like
 
03:27:30.269 --> 03:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
what what would be the difference in
 
03:27:33.429 --> 03:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
vetting those two types of people well
 
03:27:35.429 --> 03:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um I I
 
03:27:37.110 --> 03:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
recognize the vetting process is
 
03:27:38.630 --> 03:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
challenging it's something that actually
 
03:27:41.510 --> 03:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
is probably worth some evaluation and to
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
see what that vetting process is and to
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that in certain situations
 
03:27:47.469 --> 03:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
it's not fast tracked just because of a
 
03:27:50.950 --> 03:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
good feeling about somebody um that's
 
03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
something that I promise I'll look into
 
03:27:54.189 --> 03:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
and see if there's something that can be
 
03:27:56.910 --> 03:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
done in terms of that however the more
 
03:27:59.990 --> 03:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
that we open this up to to additional
 
03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
people the more that the the more
 
03:28:05.389 --> 03:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
opportunities for problems there are yet
 
03:28:06.950 --> 03:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
I also understand we don't want to be
 
03:28:08.309 --> 03:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
putting children into homes we don't
 
03:28:10.189 --> 03:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
want to be shipping them out of state we
 
03:28:11.469 --> 03:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
don't want to be putting them somewhere
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
else but we need to acknowledge the fact
 
03:28:17.950 --> 03:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
that there can be um you inappropriate
 
03:28:20.510 --> 03:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
relationships representative Raymond
 
03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my question is
 
03:28:25.870 --> 03:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
actually for you Mr chairman can we ask
 
03:28:29.309 --> 03:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
um DCF what or the representatives from
 
03:28:32.349 --> 03:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
DHHS what the vetting process is for
 
03:28:34.870 --> 03:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
placement with um people who aren't
 
03:28:36.510 --> 03:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
certified foster homes or certified
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
placement representative I was just
 
03:28:40.750 --> 03:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
about to do that oh thank you so thank

you for seconding
 
03:28:44.830 --> 03:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
that because I I think the
 
03:28:47.950 --> 03:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
Representative makes a good point
 
03:28:49.110 --> 03:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you if you're done with me I'll
 
03:28:50.469 --> 03:28:50.479 align:start position:0%

Cher nothing thank you thank you now how
 
03:29:00.269 --> 03:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
about representative Raymond's
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
question you're it guys you too you're
 
03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
you represent all 4800 DC uh DHHS
 
03:29:11.429 --> 03:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
employees well thank you um yeah so back
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
in 2022 kinship Care Homes were added to
 
03:29:18.189 --> 03:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
the definition of foster care um uh
 
03:29:20.630 --> 03:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
facilities uh kinship Care Home Means A
 
03:29:22.469 --> 03:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
type of foster home in which an
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
individual or individuals are licens to
 
03:29:27.309 --> 03:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
provide care exclusively to Kin and then
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
like I said before kin is defined as I
 
03:29:31.229 --> 03:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
read that definition earlier uh there
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
shall be a maximum of six children in
 
03:29:36.550 --> 03:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
the home and children uh and children
 
03:29:38.510 --> 03:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
receive for child care who are related
 
03:29:40.750 --> 03:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
to the residents um those six other
 
03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
people uh we are currently in a contract
 
03:29:46.429 --> 03:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
with um an organization called a a
 
03:29:48.910 --> 03:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
chance they are the ones that are
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
licensing uh these kinship Care Homes um
 
03:29:54.590 --> 03:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
so once they are licensed they are able
 
03:29:57.070 --> 03:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
to receive foster care payments because
 
03:29:59.070 --> 03:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
that was the hurdle that many uh
 
03:30:01.229 --> 03:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
relatives and fictive kin were being
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
vetted but were unable to receive foster
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
care payments and maintenance for the
 
03:30:08.990 --> 03:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
care of these children so based on the
 
03:30:11.189 --> 03:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
changes to the statute in
 
03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
2022 these kinship homes will be our LIC
 
03:30:17.309 --> 03:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
are being licensed and will continue to
 
03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
be licensed and during that licensing
 
03:30:21.469 --> 03:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
process there's obviously a an
 
03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
application a vetting um a home study um
 
03:30:27.950 --> 03:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
a study uh background checks and and all
 
03:30:30.229 --> 03:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
that goes into um making sure that the
 
03:30:32.750 --> 03:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
child is placed in a safe and
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate home that is with someone
 
03:30:36.120 --> 03:30:37.309 align:start position:0%
appropriate home that is with someone
they

03:30:37.309 --> 03:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:30:40.670 --> 03:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
know follow up thank you Mr chairman so
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
in so what happens when there's an
 
03:30:46.110 --> 03:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
emergency or even in in this case where
 
03:30:47.870 --> 03:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
a delinquency has happened and a child
 
03:30:47.880 --> 03:30:49.030 align:start position:0%
a delinquency has happened and a child
needs

03:30:49.030 --> 03:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
needs
 
03:30:51.550 --> 03:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
placement do they have to go to a group
 
03:30:54.389 --> 03:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
home while the you know the you know
 
03:30:56.469 --> 03:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
Uncle Mike or whomever is being vetted
 
03:30:58.670 --> 03:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
through the vetting process or can they
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
go there like on a conditional basis
 
03:31:04.349 --> 03:31:04.359 align:start position:0%
while the my understanding again my
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is I'm not the subject
 
03:31:07.590 --> 03:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
matter expert at this but this is my
 
03:31:09.309 --> 03:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
understanding working on the uh
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
licensing process with kinship Care
 
03:31:13.710 --> 03:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
Homes is that there are certain things
 
03:31:16.590 --> 03:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
that are called day one non-negotiable
 
03:31:19.030 --> 03:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
that have to be done that day one to in
 
03:31:24.070 --> 03:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
order to place um uh child with the
 
03:31:26.349 --> 03:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
uncle and that uncle has to have a
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
background check which would require the
 
03:31:32.910 --> 03:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh cpsw to call the local PDS to come in
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
observe the home do a walkth through of
 
03:31:38.189 --> 03:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
the home and answer ask and be answered
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
a certain non-negotiable questions
 
03:31:43.790 --> 03:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
regarding safety of that child and then
 
03:31:46.510 --> 03:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
after that the more formal vet goes in

Betty gay from Salem and I'm going to uh

try to IM give a example of what
 
03:32:37.030 --> 03:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson referred to I had
 
03:32:40.950 --> 03:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
never heard of fictive kin until January
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
when a person who I now I can't name
 
03:32:46.110 --> 03:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
them because it does involve a child but
 
03:32:48.030 --> 03:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
a person that you've heard many times so
 
03:32:50.950 --> 03:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
you'd have respect for had a child
 
03:32:53.790 --> 03:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
15-year-old knock on her door and ask if
 
03:32:56.309 --> 03:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
she could have a drink of water she had
 
03:32:58.389 --> 03:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
been walking
 
03:33:01.950 --> 03:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
from she'd been walking a long time
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
turns out everybody at school and the
 
03:33:08.309 --> 03:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
police knew this child's
 
03:33:13.189 --> 03:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
situation the person abusing her was her
 
03:33:13.199 --> 03:33:14.750 align:start position:0%
situation the person abusing her was her
aunt's

03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
aunt's
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
husband so she could have been there but
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank goodness for fictive kin this
 
03:33:23.269 --> 03:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
person whose home she just decided to
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
walk up to because it looked like a
 
03:33:27.870 --> 03:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
place people came to they had a sign out
 
03:33:27.880 --> 03:33:29.950 align:start position:0%
place people came to they had a sign out
front

03:33:29.950 --> 03:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
front
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
um this child the school knew the
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
situation and the police actually had
 
03:33:41.710 --> 03:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
her real aunt say to them that very day
 
03:33:43.510 --> 03:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
I don't want
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
her um and because it just like it was
 
03:33:51.550 --> 03:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
pre-ordained It was supposed to happen
 
03:33:54.790 --> 03:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
this child is now under their care it
 
03:33:56.189 --> 03:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
was established
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
immediately because of the fictive kin a
 
03:33:59.920 --> 03:34:01.630 align:start position:0%
immediately because of the fictive kin a
a

03:34:01.630 --> 03:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:34:04.189 --> 03:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
permission I'm not sure what word to use
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
but because it is
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
allowed she this child could once again
 
03:34:13.030 --> 03:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
go into a home and be cared for while
 
03:34:15.750 --> 03:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
they were doing all the steps necessary
 
03:34:19.189 --> 03:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
because if they had waited for the um
 
03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
for them to complete the foster care
 
03:34:24.269 --> 03:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
that would have taken a few months
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
meanwhile this child needed shelter
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
immediately and so the story that's how
 
03:34:32.269 --> 03:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
I found out about it because I was
 
03:34:35.429 --> 03:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
called would you be a reference you know
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
a personal reference for the the uh new
 
03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:40.910 align:start position:0%
a personal reference for the the uh new
fictive

03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
fictive
 
03:34:44.590 --> 03:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
parents so I thought I had to say this
 
03:34:46.830 --> 03:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
because as our representative Nelson
 
03:34:46.840 --> 03:34:47.910 align:start position:0%
because as our representative Nelson
pointed

03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
pointed
 
03:34:50.510 --> 03:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
out you don't want to send a child
 
03:34:52.030 --> 03:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere where they're not going to be
 
03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
cared for safely but you can't just
 
03:34:57.389 --> 03:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
assume that because they are relatives
 
03:34:59.349 --> 03:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
that it's any safer than someone that
 
03:35:02.670 --> 03:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
you're vetting and have a relationship
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
with so I certainly support continuing
 
03:35:09.670 --> 03:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
continuing the uh fictive relationship
 
03:35:13.269 --> 03:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
qualifying people to be uh caretakers of
 
03:35:15.950 --> 03:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
children who need a safe home any
 
03:35:19.189 --> 03:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
