00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to go ahead and open up
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
today's hearings that we have scheduled
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
here in the house education committee I
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
trust all members of the committee had a
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful break and relaxed a little bit
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
um chair which the chair was down here
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
four out of the five days but
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be back in commit here
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
but we do have some items on the docket
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
today especially that last bill I want
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
to speak to it a little bit um at 12:30
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
we have a bill schedule relative to
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
standardized assessment data for
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
participants in the education Freedom
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
accounts um we will be holding that in
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
this room however we have two rooms
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
which are going to receive ex access
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
excess um people who want to testify and
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing like we've done before
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be you know announcing the person
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
not the person's on deck and maybe even
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
the person in the Hole uh so that um we
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
can have people flow in here if and when
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
I was speaking with on Friday the folks
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
that are in charge of Maintenance here
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
in the building and operations they're
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
they're sheetrocking down the hall and
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't know they were going to be
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
doing exactly what they've got we knew
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
they were coming in we thought it was
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
going to be done over the weekend and
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
and so what we will do is we'll watch
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
that and if it becomes too much of a
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
congestion we'll have to move it to reps
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
Hall so we'll make that decision as we
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
get going into the process here and find
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
how many people show up to testify on
 
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.550 align:start position:0%
how many people show up to testify on
that

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
bill so that'll be at 12:30 this
 
00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon so right now I'd like to back
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
up to the top to 9:00 where we are with
 
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.509 align:start position:0%
up to the top to 9:00 where we are with
HB

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
1608 this is relative to provide
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
providing an induction program for new
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
teachers and this is represent Myers
 
00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
Bill he is not here today um so repon
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
luno is going to present that bill on
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
his behalf thank you and welcome thank
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair members of the
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Dave luno uh
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
representing the people of Hopkinson and
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
Bo and folks all across the uh the the
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
great Granite State and um I'm here this
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
morning on representative Myers's behalf
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
to introduce House Bill
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
16008 uh relative to providing an
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
induction program for new teachers so I
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
should start out saying that my
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
background is in electrical
 
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
engineering and so induction has a very
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
different meaning in that context um and
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh it usually involves very very high
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
strength magnetic fields or electric
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
fields and um and so when I first looked
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
at this bill I'm like oh my gosh what
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
are we actually planning on doing for
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
new teachers how could this possibly
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
possibly be a good thing well turns out
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
induction has another meaning and and it
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
it goes more along the lines of
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
mentorship and um and so what
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
1608 is about it's it's not applying
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
high strength electric and magnetic
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
fields to new teachers it's about
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
providing them uh a mentor uh as they
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
get started in um uh in the early stages
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
of their their career so um so the um
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
without going through the the the
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
details of of all the bills and I I
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
believe um we're going to be able to to
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
hear uh from Mr Hawkins on um on what
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
some of these are um uh that uh that
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
there that there are are many
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations that come from the um
 
00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:46.839 align:start position:0%
the report on that came out of the
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage study commission and
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
mentorship was uh was one of those
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
recommendations and U uh like I said I'm
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh I'm you know I had misunderstood what
 
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
uh I'm you know I had misunderstood what
the

00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
original intent to this bill is you know
 
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
um so so don't ask me too many questions
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
about mentoring if you want to ask me
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
questions about um about you know um
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
magnetic induction and stuff like that
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take those but I think Mr
 
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
Hawkins could certainly talk about um uh
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
the recommendations uh along these lines
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
that came out of the report thank you Mr
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much are there any
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions for represent
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
luno oh my gosh represent
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.070 align:start position:0%
luno oh my gosh represent
woodcock

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
good to see you again good morning um
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
just do you are represent my and I'm
 
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
sure maybe has any background on about
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
how many schools in the state don't have
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
a program existing for mentorship uh I I
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
can't speak for representative Miler but
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't have that information
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank CH are there any
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
other questions so you're not going to
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
talk about conduction
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
huh or all temperatures and electricity
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
no okay about half to so okay represent
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you thank you for uh
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
presenting this um just you might not
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this but I didn't see
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
it specifically mentioned but there is a
 
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
um A1
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
thousand um stipended I guess to the uh
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
to the mentor but I'm not sure where if
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's a state um funded uh stipended or
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a locally funded yeah I I'm not
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
sure specified that's a very good
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you I'm not sure that's
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
specified uh in here I think if this is
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
going to be a state law then it then you
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
know I would I would recommend it be a
 
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
state-funded um uh
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation further questions
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
representa Tanner thank you and I don't
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
know if this question is for you or for
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
the chair but um I'm just curious why
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
when there's a statement like that in
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
the in the uh methodology on the
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
financial notes fiscal note that that
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education we're
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
getting um indeterminable or zero in the
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh responsibility for local or or
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
state and yet the methodology goes on to
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
explain and and kind of take a take a
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
position I'm just
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
wondering what why that happens like
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
that yeah no I think that's I I I I
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't know uh why it happens and um and
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
you know I I would also suggest that
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
that the department would probably have
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
some idea you know in terms of the
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
number of uh of firste um early career
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
teachers uh that there are in the state
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
and multiply that out by $1,000 and that
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
would be the uh the the sort of ballpark
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
um uh State obligation so I don't know
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
why it's why it's
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
indeterminable further
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank uh repent Hall thank you
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
question um it says on line 29 the doe
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules um though is still
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
this still going to be mostly local
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
control like who picks the who picks the
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
mentee or the mentor sorry the mentor m
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
is as a new person but um is most of the
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
power going to be local or is it going
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
to be the doe I I again I'm not sure how
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
the how the bill reflects on that my my
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
sort of understanding about how you know
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
we we've we've done some things in our
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
school district in the past is that is
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
that a an early career teacher may be
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
paired up with uh with a with a a master
 
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
teacher or senior more senior teacher um
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh that that already is employed by the
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
by the district um I can't remember I
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
don't remember uh if there was a stipend
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
um that we uh that that that the School
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
District offered uh to the mentor but I
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
think in this case what it's saying is
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
let's let's take that off of the the
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
shoulders of the of the local and make
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
it something that that encourages the
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
local to do by have by making it a state
 
00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
program further questions from the
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative McDonald thank
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
representative um line
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
eight it says an orientation program for
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
beginning teachers and all other
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
incoming new teachers to the district is
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
that the same program or would the
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
school district have to implement two
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
different programs perhaps if a teacher
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
does have experience perhaps Decades of
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
experience but in a different School
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
District would they be a part of this
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
orientation program the way that's
 
00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
worded yeah that's a that's a good
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm I think the orientation
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
program is really really to sort of uh
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
introduce teachers that are new to the
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
school whether they're experienced
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
teachers or whether they're new to the
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
to the to the teaching profession um
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
just sort of how you know introduce them
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
to the school building introduce them
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
around to other teachers who are the who
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
are the people to who are the go-to
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
people if you've got a question about
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
this or a question about that that type
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
of stuff you know further questions
 
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much great thank you very
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome we have a card here
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:42.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh good morning good morning uh thank
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for the record Brian
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hawkins rep representing Nea New
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I I'll add just a few
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
points um f first to say I was not the
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
author of The Language uh uh for this
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
bill and so uh just for for context but
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
we certainly do support the intent of
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
this as representative luno mentioned
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
earlier uh this was a topic of
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
discussion during the the teacher
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
shortage committee um that this support
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
early on uh in in the career of a
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
teacher not only uh new to the career
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
but new to a school um is particularly
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
important and it's in those first uh
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
several years where uh you really have
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
an idea whether someone is going to be
 
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
able to continue on um as as as an
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
educator um or not uh last year um and I
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
I think some of the intent of this is
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
similar to what uh Senate Bill 218 which
 
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
is currently on the table in the house
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh held and that was you know a
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
mentorship program that was uh there for
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh Educators in their first few years of
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
their career or in in a school a couple
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
of comments I just wanted to uh make on
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
some of the language um first just there
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
are schools that do have mentorship
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
programs um some of those mentorship
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
programs are collectively bargained and
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
so um if the committee moves forward
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
with the bill I think would be important
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh acknowledge and accommodate uh the
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
fact that there there are already some
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
of these programs that are in place not
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
every school um has mentorship program
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
or or a robust mentorship program I
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
don't have figures on that but um uh
 
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
again the bill that came to you from the
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
Senate last year the intent there was to
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
help Foster and grow those programs I
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
think the same intent um is is here so
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
there's uh and then finally um and maybe
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
this was probably better for the
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
Department to speak to you know the
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill they talk about uh
 
00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:07.630 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill they talk about uh
guidelines

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
um being established by the
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
department um my understanding is the
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
department used to have a mentorship
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
program within the department but uh I
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
am not sure where that is at uh
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
currently and so we would obviously want
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
the resources to be there to be able to
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
support this type of program to make
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
sure successful so uh with that I'll
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
close my testimony I'm happy to take any
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions of Mr
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
Hawkins yes represent Damon thank you Mr
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
would you have any information on the
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
impact of mentorship programs on teacher
 
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
retention uh yes um there I I would be
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
happy to supply the committee with some
 
00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
of that uh I can tell you
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
anecdotally um I do know educators who
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh made decisions on where to be a
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
teacher uh based on the fact that a
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
school district had a robust mentorship
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
program e even though they may have uh
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
made just a little bit less money um
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that they had uh the support
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
going into especially you know as I said
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
for uh a brand new educator um you know
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's worth worth its weight in gold so
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yes further yes represent cascaden
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
my question I'm not sure if um if you
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
would have this um information but I'm
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
questioning uh title two funds which
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
schools get who are designed for
 
00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.230 align:start position:0%
schools get who are designed for
professional

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
development and at one point I can't
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
remember if it was in the last
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
session um we we may have had a
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
conversation about um teacher mentorship
 
00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:58.350 align:start position:0%
conversation about um teacher mentorship
and

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
induction and there might have been an
 
00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
issue and I I think there's somebody
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
here from the Department where districts
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
may have to expend their title two funds
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
before they can access these funds or is
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
there no relationship between the two or
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
between the two do you know uh that
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I do recall that
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
conversation in in the bill I mentioned
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
earlier that was on the table I I did
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
notice that in the Department's fiscal
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
note I think they referenced
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
to unless I'm I'm thinking of another
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
bill but um that would be a good
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
question for the Department I'm I'm
 
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
sorry thanks that's all right yeah yeah
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent W thank
 
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%
you chairman good morning good to see
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
you again good morning welcome back um
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
the same question I asked representative
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
luno uh in New Hampshire do you have any
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
idea how many schools don't have some
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
type of orientation or mentorship
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
program uh I I don't have a an exact
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
figure for you I'm sorry um I don't
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
think it's something that is tracked to
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
my knowledge um either by the department
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh other than you know sort of going
 
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
School District by School District to
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
see if they have either have a policy or
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
something in a in a contract that
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
indicates that but I know that it's not
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
all schools so in essence the the
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility currently is dependent
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
upon the local school district if they
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
choose to provide a program program
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
that' be correct there's no law that
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
requires that that this would uh
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
supplement or or plant not not to my
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
knowledge um and and for uh many school
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
districts it's a it's a resource uh
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
decision you know I mean okay having to
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
decide between do I uh you know allocate
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
money toward this program when I was at
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh involved with the state employees
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
we had a conversation in in finance one
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
year about how training and that that
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
sort of those were some of the first
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
things to always get cut the budget
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
process so thank you thank you chairman
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
further further
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much all right
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'd like to hear
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
McLean good morning good morning uh my
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
name is Mark mlan first of all thank you
 
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh chairman thank you uh committee for
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
letting me come to the microphone my
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
name is Mark mlan I represent the New
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school administrators
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
Association um essentially I'm just here
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
in case there are any questions I can
 
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
tell you that when I was a
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent the districts that I was
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
in had a robust Mentor program in fact
 
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
it was a two-year Mentor program for
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
brand new teachers and for teachers who
 
00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:52.039 align:start position:0%
were new to the district it was really
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
just suited based on what their needs
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
were um they were beholding to it for
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
one year but was differentiated based on
 
00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
their needs and I can tell you that in
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
marac Valley 50% of the salary for the
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
2A are there followup questions for Mr
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
mlan uh I will note to the the committee
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
members here we did have a teacher
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
shortage committee which me was it last
 
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
summer I'm it's all meshing together um
 
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
and some of the recommendations which
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
are in that report are worthy of our
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
looking at here I'm looking at one right
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
now uh invest in robust teacher
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
mentoring programs and opportunities for
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
professional learning and that's what
 
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
this is all about right here so if we
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
look at that report we might be able to
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
see where that study ended up um so I'll
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
try and get a copy of that make it
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
available for all people on the
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
committee here are there representative
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
question could you uh kind of um explain
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit how cultures differ from
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
school to school and how uh orientation
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
to those cultures and demographics is
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
really important for an incoming teacher
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're experienced or not sure
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
um first of all there's a lot to learn
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
just about local processes everything
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
from uh the acronyms that are being used
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
when it comes to which meetings you're
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
going to to just really understanding
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
the building and the culture and clim of
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
that particular Learning Community um
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
essentially what I've seen in my
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
experience is that Mentor programs will
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
reign from someone who just said here's
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
an experienced person in your department
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
they will meet with you kind of
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
informally to make sure that you have
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
the sports you need to a coaching
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
program where there is essentially a
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum where you're really working
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
with the teacher uh to ensure that
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
they're getting what they need and as
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
others before me have mentioned there is
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of evidence and I don't know those
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but there there
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
is research out there about the impact
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
of a mentor program on teachers staying
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
and teachers feeling as though they
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
belong in their Learning Community um I
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
would also add that uh there are some
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
great teacher mentors around the state
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
that if you wanted to learn more about
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
Mentor programs it'd be great to hear
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
from and uh when I was in marac Valley
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
what we did is we had a new teacher
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
orientation program and um we brought
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
all the new teachers together we uh
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
really tried to play up the fact that
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
they were the class of whatever class
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
they were coming in in as say
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
2022 um there would be t-shirts there
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
would be pictures it'd be a signing
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
ceremony it was almost like when a a
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
college player uh or when a high school
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
player is choosing their college so
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
essentially we really tried to play up
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
the fact that they were choosing marac
 
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
Valley and um it was it was powerful and
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the year we would meet with
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
teachers um and we would uh the the
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent myself would go
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh meet with them bring them a hot cup
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
of coffee ask them how it was going and
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
it was typically during December or
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
January when the days started growing
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
shorter and perhaps folks are
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
questioning their sanity just a little
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
bit because they're driving to work in
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
the dark and leaving in the dark and
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
really just to make sure that folks are
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
getting what they need do they have all
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
the supports in place and then we would
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
interview people and ask them whether or
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
not it was meeting their needs and we
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
would really learn about the mentor
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
program and what teachers needed and it
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
was really really beneficial and it does
 
00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:29.950 align:start position:0%
was really really beneficial and it does
impact

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
turnover the the program we're talking
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
about um there were a number of uh
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
aspects to it there was h a teacher loan
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
forgiveness portion of this there was uh
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
teacher preparation
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
institutions like you University of New
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire keen and Plymouth are they
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
preparing properly for these people to
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
come into our schools and also the
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
mentoring program for new teachers and
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
it also was discussing for those
 
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
teachers that might be moving into a
 
00:34:05.629 --> 00:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
district from another District um and
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit different though
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
than you know the brand new teacher and
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
how we use the title two Monies to work
 
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
in and mesh with this uh so Mark you
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
said you did not have any idea how many
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
districts are using title 2 for this
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
purp yeah I don't know and I don't know
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
if the department is tracking that
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
information I think it's an interesting
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
question and I see that um might be
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
looking for that answer right now I'm
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
not sure typing feverishly back there um
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
so uh you know again I would reference
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
just that it depends on how districts
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
are leveraging that whether or not
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're spreading the mentorship program
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
amongst a lot of personnel or whether
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
they have a teacher mentor on staff who
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
essentially has a case load of new
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
teachers every single year and the touch
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
points are different with people based
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
on what their needs are and as you just
 
00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
referenced whether or not they're coming
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
from uh as an experienced teacher from a
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
different District their needs are
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
different and uh whether or not there a
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
brand new teacher coming from a teacher
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
training program their needs are also
 
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
going to be different so um you know I
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
think it's difficult and as
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ludo luno alluded to um I
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
think you know funding this is extremely
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
important and as it stands right now I
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
think people are funding it differently
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's part of collective
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining as uh Mr Hawkins talked about
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
or whether it's part of uh title 2A or
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's just um you know something
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
that that folks are doing as like an
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
extra stien for teachers and it just
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
comes from the general budget so I think
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
there are a variety of ways that folks
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
are funding it right now but to do it
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
right um just like everything uh takes
 
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.390 align:start position:0%
right um just like everything uh takes
some

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
resources yes represent
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
Tanner yes um thank you is there a
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
similar program for
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
administrators that's a great question
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
and I thought about that as I was
 
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
walking up um I think it's typically
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the leadership team to do
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
that so in my experience it's been much
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
more informal but it is similar uh it
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
has not been a stipended position in my
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
experience uh that said it doesn't mean
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be and um you know I
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
I again I think it's part of the
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
leadership culture and the leadership
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
team that you or that someone uh is
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
joining so it's certainly important and
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
also for support staff there are
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
mentorship uh program out there as well
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
and uh the New Hampshire school
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
administrators Association
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
is designing right now in partial
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the Department a
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
mentor program that will support
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
incoming system leaders and we recognize
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
that as being a really important aspect
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
to success a really important aspect to
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
folks learning the New Hampshire way and
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
could be connected to lcen chair and
 
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.589 align:start position:0%
could be connected to lcen chair and
other

00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
aspects is there a problem Mark with
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
this that we have many property poor
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
communities that are training teachers
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
they get them trained they get them
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
mentored and bingo they're gone the next
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
year to the ab budding District which is
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
paying $10,000 more per year is that a
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
issue that we need to also address well
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
it's certainly an issue um and again I
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
think uh anybody here has read the book
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
by Daniel pink called drive or heard of
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
it um talks about motivation and what
 
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.550 align:start position:0%
it um talks about motivation and what
actually

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh people who have high cognition in
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
their jobs and are making a lot of
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
decisions what brings them actualization
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
and fulfillment in work it's not always
 
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
money but money is part of it so I think
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
if we can work together and there are
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
programs that actually support teachers
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
teachers have voice and agency in their
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
jobs they're going to find a lot of
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
actualization and as uh Mr Hawkins
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
alluded to sometimes folks will stay in
 
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
a district where they make less money
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
but they have more professional
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
fulfillment and feel as though their
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
impact is something that they can
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
continue with and they can continue to
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
grow I can tell you that I taught in
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
Newport for my first two years and then
 
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.079 align:start position:0%
I moved to marac Valley so um you know
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes that does happen but sometimes
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's also based on geographic location
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
as well thank you are there any other
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank thank you very much
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh does the department
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
have any information for us on this on
 
00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:25.030 align:start position:0%
have any information for us on this on
title

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
title
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
good morning Melissa white division
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
director for learner Support Department
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
of Education um I have uh some estimates
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
on the past three years the amount of
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
title 2 funding that was utilized to
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
support mentorship and induction
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
programs in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
that is at about 2.9 Million so roughly
 
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
a million per per year is being utilized
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
out of the title 2 funds for these
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
programs across the state I was trying
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
to get the exact number of leas and I'm
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
working on getting that um but I don't
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
have that number off um with me right
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
now the proposed legislation I just want
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
would violate section 222g of the esa
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
Elementary and secondary Education Act
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
of 1965 regarding supplement versus
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
supplanting so if the state does decide
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this legislation
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's just important that we recognize
 
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
then title 2 or other federal funds
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
could not be utilized for this
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
particular work we would have to utilize
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
state and local funds to support this
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
the reason why the um fiscal note showed
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
indeterminable because we don't have the
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
exact number of new teachers because I
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
think the proposed legislation does have
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
a component in there about have three
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
years of
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
experience in the first initial three
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
years of teaching but it also could be
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
new in New in that uh content area I
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
think that was another piece of it that
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
might have been the the first iteration
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
of of this proposed legislation so not
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
having those numbers on how many
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
teachers we couldn't give a exact
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
estimate but we're looking at you know
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
the ,000 for the stien depending on the
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
number of teachers that you know that
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
would cover um in addition to I think
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
each district Works a little bit
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
differently but if you're looking at
 
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
classroom observation
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
time there there's costs associated with
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
substitutes and that type of thing so
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's just to consider it could impact
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
different schools in different ways as
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
far as how they would support this work
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
so that's why we had that that piece in
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
there that we just couldn't give you an
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
exact number but I mean it could be zero
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
but it could ALS so be a little bit more
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at some of the
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
schools that do have large numbers of um
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
new teachers they tend to have pretty
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
robust um mentorship programs I can
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
think of a a few pretty pretty great
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
districts in our state that that have
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
those strong programs thank you
 
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
those strong programs thank you
represent

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
dry thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
the question do you know how many school
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
districts do uh MERS ship as part of
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining that I don't know
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sorry represent Tanner
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um I you went through why
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds couldn't be used for this
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
and I didn't quite catch the whole thing
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
could could you kind of slow that down
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
and and explain what part of the federal
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh regulations prohibit use of this for
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
mentoring and also and tagging into that
 
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
so you can include it can local funds be
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
used after the federal funds have been
 
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.349 align:start position:0%
used after the federal funds have been
expended

00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
expended
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so with the
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
supplement versus supplant that is um a
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
little bit tricky with the federal funds
 
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.079 align:start position:0%
because if the state passes a law making
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
a requirement then it's the state's
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility to cover whatever cost
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be associated with that
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
requirement so if you have a certain
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
requirement you cannot use your federal
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
funds to then pay for that state
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
mandated requirement so with the
 
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:30.559 align:start position:0%
the federal funds in addition to title
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
two we're looking at idea is another
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
huge chunk I didn't get the figures for
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
that one but idea funds are used for the
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
special education uh new teacher
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
induction programs and mentorship
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
programs in addition to the um special
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
education administrators any new
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
administrators in special education um
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
the state has a contract where we um
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
provide a program for all of those new
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
administrators to support them in their
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
first couple of years of uh in their
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
position as administrators but schools
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
do also use those funds then to support
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
the the um new special education
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
teachers whether they're new to special
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
education altogether or a new teacher
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
and new to special education so that
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
that's another uh
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
consideration it would be challenging to
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
track expending all of our funds
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide and then to just say okay
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
we've spent all our funds now we can you
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
know tap into the federal funds if it's
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
a it's a mandate it it
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
gets um it it could be contested by by
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
the feds if they were looking into
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
it are all your federal funds title 2
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
used each year uh I know the last time
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
you were here we heard about title 2 and
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
how some districts still have
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
money over here what happens if there's
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
a surplus or a balance left in that
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
particular account at the end of that
 
00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
period in which the money should be
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
expended it's returned to the feds it's
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
returned are we returning money to the
 
00:44:09.559 --> 00:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
returned are we returning money to the
feds

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
feds
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes I wouldn't say it's a large balance
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
but yes we do return funds and I can get
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
those figures to if you want to take a
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
look at how much in the title two funds
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
were returning each year represent Damon
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
state level funds we tend to spend down
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
completely so we do get a state level
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
set aside portion for our work at the
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
state level and that's what we utilize
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
for um one of the programs we offer
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
right now is through um oh it's not 321
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
Insight uh teach United it's a program
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
that goes into some of our more rural
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
schools and school districts and does um
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
a mentorship support program but it
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
makes it um really beneficial because
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
they're able to tap into um teachers
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
across that different um regions so they
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
may not all be from the same school but
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
if you have one new teacher here one new
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
teacher here one new teacher here it
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
creates kind of a community and a
 
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative with that particular work
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a Statewide mentorship
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
program but we do have smaller programs
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
that we're tapping into and offering
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
across the state with these
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
organizations nhli is another one that
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
that is looking at doing some work with
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
us um to specifically
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
so we do have programming focused on
 
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
this but um I
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
think looking back at perhaps some of
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
the work that we did in the past and
 
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
having that
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
Statewide initiative might might be
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
beneficial thank you representa Tanner
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you just as a followup to that so
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding from what you just said
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
is that the federal funds come to the
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
State Department of Education and that
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
to a large extent you are the people
 
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
that prescribe
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
the me the mentorship or what what can
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
happen in the different schools for um
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
staff development so when we're talking
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
about an induction program such as this
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
um could this could the Department of
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
Education take this particular outline
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
from the commission and actually set up
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
a program that would be federally funded
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh rather than uh force it on to the
 
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
local school districts
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
as long as we didn't stick it in
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
legislation excuse me as long as we
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
didn't put it in legislation once it
 
00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:34.839 align:start position:0%
goes into law then it's a state so how
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
do we how do we get it into the doe
 
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
rather than put it through
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
um it could be a little bit tricky
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
because if it goes into legislation then
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
it is a state law but if we're looking
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
at doing initi an initiative outside of
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
that then it would just be something
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
that we work
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
on I kind of outside
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
of outside of this room represent
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I actually have
 
00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
two questions please so the first is I'm
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
not sure if I understood correctly but I
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
think a few minutes ago you indicated
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
that the title two funds that the state
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
receives need to be entirely spent
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
before local can step in so it's not
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the title two funds are distributed
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
to different districts and the district
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
could expend their title two and then
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
local step in it's the whole state um
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
yes correct pool is that correct which
 
00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
is I think 11 million and that's why you
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
said it would be hard to track because
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
correct especially if we're returning
 
00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:46.839 align:start position:0%
funds each
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
year and the other question is
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
the 2.9 million plus that you referenced
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
and is in the more recent fiscal note
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
that we got that is currently funding
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
some mentoring for new teachers and
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
administrators do we have any breakdown
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
of how many districts are utilizing that
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
or what gaps there are in other words
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
how adequate or not is the existing
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
resources I don't have that information
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
to provide to you but I can give that to
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
you and send it in a followup but we do
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
we are able to look at some of those and
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
with one of the programs I mentioned the
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
teach United We in fact do that we look
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
at okay they're utilizing their funds um
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
for all of these purposes with title 2
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
so here we you know they could benefit
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
from being involved in this program that
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
that does this induction and and this
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
support um for the new teachers but it's
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
really the district um uh stepping up
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
and and taking that initiative saying
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
they want to be a part of it so we're
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
not requiring it of them that something
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
that they're reaching out saying yes we
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
do want to be a part of this and then so
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
we do pro provide that indu ction in
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
mentorship is incredibly important
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown that teachers that do
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
have that mentorship um and I think it
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
is a three years that a lot of the
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
studies have looked at it might be up to
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
five years but retention they they do
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
see all the studies across the board
 
00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
have shown teachers tend to stick in the
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
field past of five years if they're
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
involved in a high quality in induction
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
program thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned that
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
unused funds are sent back to the
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
federal government so are you not as a
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
as a department re Distributing
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
funds we we cannot take the funds and
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
redistribute them be because they have
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
until the ending of that date so if it's
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
September 30th is usually our deadlines
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
so September 30th of 23 the schools Can
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
U have until until them to utilize their
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
funds so then we see okay after
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
September 30th or you know 45 days of
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
closing who didn't utilize all their
 
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
funds that funding period that period of
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
performance has already ended so we
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't then take the funds and
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
redistribute we are now looking at um
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
currently for our following uh year for
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
2425 we're establishing an application
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
system so that schools can then say okay
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
we intend to spend down this amount of
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
funds and then we will be able to take
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
that Remer and redistribute but the way
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
that we've been uh structured in the
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
past if they had until September 30th
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
and they'd have to indicate prior to
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
that that they weren't going to so that
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
we could redistribute it according to
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
the formula so it couldn't just be like
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay this school district is you know
 
00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
is not going to utilize all their funds
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to give it to this
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
one it has to be by the formula so it
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
would have to go out to all of the
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
school other school districts evenly
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
according to the the the formula follow
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
up yes um so just to clarify in my mind
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
because I'm familiar with redistribution
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
of funds is it that you need to go out
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
to the district say in the springtime to
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
see what funds are you not going to use
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
moving forward or what activities have
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
not been planned yet and that pool of
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
money is then looked at and
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
redistributed and I know there's a short
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
window of time to expend that yes but
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
most of the time they do say they're
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
going to utilize it all and if we look
 
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
at you know a little bit here a little
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
bit here a little bit here collectively
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
it does end up you know
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
being a good uh amount of funding that
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
could be utilized but at that point it's
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know past the date and not many are
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
willing to say in April no I'm not going
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
to spend down my entire funds we don't
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
see that too much okay but we we work
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
with them to try to U utilize the funds
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
and expend it and sometimes you know
 
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
they have good intentions of spending
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
down the funds but then
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
maybe something falls through or a
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
program do you know they anticipated um
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
doing a specific uh event or whatever it
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
might be training and then it falls
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
through that I mean that does happen
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
talk withu
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
orientation and the doe is currently
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
very supportive of that under the title
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
of funding is there a reason that Doe as
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
an entity hasn't required all schools or
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
have they put technal advis saying these
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
are these are mod lead programs that we
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
fund so we understand the connection
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
between your attention and teach the
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
success something we do Statewide deal
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't do every school do so we do offer
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
model activities but the funding really
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
is locally needs to be determined
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
because they need to do A needs
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
assessment and analyze what you know
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
what their priorities are so if they're
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
seeing you know there are school
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
districts that look and say we have a
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
very strong need for a mentorship and
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
induction program we are going to focus
 
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
our funds on this after doing their
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
needs assessment there might be others
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
that don't have a different need and so
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
they prioritize the funds in a different
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
way but it really is up to the local
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
level we provide model activities and we
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
can make suggestions but we can't
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
require them to use it for a certain
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
purpose because that is you know it is
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
their funds to determine to use how they
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
see fit thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative cascan you
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
had a followup question but we could
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
prioritize our state level funds more
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
towards that if the state decided that
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
were a priority and I think that's you
 
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
know looking to the past to see what
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past and then planning
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
for the future of how we want to move
 
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
forward and and perhaps do more of the
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
state level
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah go thank you so on that point
 
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
Thank you Mr chairman so on that point
 
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
does the when you when you said the
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
state could prioritize doeses that mean
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner or the commissioner's
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
leadership staff could prioritize this
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
is where we think uh title two money
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
should be invested first um correct okay
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank chair repr scen I think
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
I had my thank you my question was along
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
the same lines so the federal funds come
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
to the department and then they're
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
distributed by the
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
titles and
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
the department I believe can take some
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
of that titled two-way money whether
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
they're paying for staff or I I don't
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
know what other guidelines they have but
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
could um the state
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
program from title 2A to meet that
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
criteria sure of before it distributes
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
its funds to the districts no so we are
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
provided a state level set aside and an
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
administrative set aside so there's this
 
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
very tiny tiny percentage that is um for
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and that's to uh
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
fund uh one staff person to operate the
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
the title 2 program then there's the
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
state level set aside portion within the
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
state level set aside portion there's a
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
chunk that is for administrators and uh
 
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
building leaders principles and so we
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
utilize those funds for nhsaa we utilize
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
it for for um the School principes
 
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
Association here in New Hampshire um
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
they offer specific events and trainings
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
and opportuni so we put our funding
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
towards that our state level um funding
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
towards that in addition to programs
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
like teach United that is doing more of
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
the rural supports for the teachers we
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
try to be creative and utilize our title
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
three funds to support um teacher
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
training and that's the state level
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
title 3 funds uh teacher trainings for
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
our um El
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
Educators the special education Ida
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
funds we try to focus that BEC so it's
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
like if we can find a specific content
 
00:56:09.069 --> 00:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
area or um specialist supports we
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
utilize those funds um but the title two
 
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
funds then we look at doing some other
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
programs um in hli we do several
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
programs with them so it it just varies
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
in in what what we do each year but we
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
have that all on our website what we
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
utilize the funds for when Distributing
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
your title 2 monies out to the districts
 
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:36.039 align:start position:0%
is it done based upon a weighted value
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
of the number of students maybe you have
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
within that District or is it based upon
 
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.039 align:start position:0%
poverty within that District uh ability
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
to raise the dollars or uh any other
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
methodology and as we do with the public
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure monies and have
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
done that with some of the Gopher monies
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
as well that we've approved up to so
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
much per District some districts are
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
capped and that's what they receive but
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
if we have money returned then it's
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
reauthorized to those districts which
 
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.039 align:start position:0%
have gone beyond their cap um is is
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
anything like that available in title to
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
no so the uh Federal um US Department of
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
Education they determine the allocations
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
for title 2 a so they'll look at the
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
numbers they have the formula they make
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
the determination they hand us a piece
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
of paper that says this is what each
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
district gets and here's the amount with
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
the um with that then we have to provide
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
the funding based on that again if
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
there's any funding let's say we were to
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know take collectively a bunch of
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
leftover funds and try to redistribute
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
it it has to be according to that
 
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
formula we couldn't say prioritize
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
somebody else with that funding the the
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
the funds that are specified for the
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
leas have to follow that specific
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
formula we can't change that at all
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions not seeing
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%

00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
education programs for granting credit
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
you committee for having me uh so this
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh is is pretty straightforward uh
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
with a lot of EFA funds being approved
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we're doing
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
the right thing by uh the way the
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
students so we want to make sure
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
that uh that our our students with
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities are not being overlooked
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
and that we're in compliance with other
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws so what this bill
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
says is that what we would be adding to
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
the language is a for-profit or
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit entity that offers an
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%

00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
section for continued compliance with
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
all state and federal
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws entities found
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
in non-compliance shall be referred to
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission um you're
 
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
probably very well familiar with state
 
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
and federal uh anti-discrimination laws
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
but just view New Hampshire Department
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
of Education does not discriminate on
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
the basis of age color disability
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
national origin race religion sex gender
 
01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.069 align:start position:0%
national origin race religion sex gender
identity

01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation veteran status or any
 
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
other category protected by applicable
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
law in access to treatment and and
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
employment um in any of its uh programs
 
01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.510 align:start position:0%
employment um in any of its uh programs
or

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
activities uh so that is and I'm getting
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
that from the Department of education's
 
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
website uh and then the
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
federal laws are actually a little bit
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.789 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:00:59.789 --> 01:00:59.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination uh statement it it
 
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.670 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination uh statement it it
said

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
everything mostly everything that I'm
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
just trying to find the exact link that
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
I had pulled up earlier and and it
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
disappeared on me but um basically it
 
01:01:16.349 --> 01:01:16.359 align:start position:0%
has to be ADA Compliant so
 
01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's essentially it do you have any
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
any reps in McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um do you know
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
of any entities within New Hampshire
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
that are offering educational
 
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
programs approved under the section that
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
are not in compliance with the law yes I
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
do um so prageru was approved uh to be
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
under and the New Hampshire Department
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
of Education approved them over the
 
01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
summer but they discriminate based on
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
religion so we would not be able to if
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be in compliance
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
with state and federal laws then they
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
would not be able to get educational
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
funds and to be fair um if we Circle
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
back to that the particular program that
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
was approved was a financial
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
literacy um course and that is offered
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
through Con Academy online for free and
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
it is in compliance with the um state
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
and federal uh anti-discrimination laws
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
so we could not only provide uh students
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
with a financial literacy course but
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
also do it for free and also do it in
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
compliance with all of the
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws may I have a
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up question yes you may was the
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
prageru course that you mentioned what
 
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
inspired you to put forward this
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
legislation or was there something else
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I've always been an advocate for
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
the disabled community
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
so uh this is basically getting us in
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
compliance with laws that are already
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
out there like federal laws
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and then
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
represent beler um thank you um just
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
wondering about um the prageru uh
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
financial literacy program how is how is
 
01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.910 align:start position:0%
financial literacy program how is how is
that

01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
program um being made available uh how
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
is that discriminated against um any
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
particular um
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
population it's in their um they they're
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
a they're a religious organization so
 
01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:38.039 align:start position:0%
unless they're going to accept students
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
of all religions and not discuss
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
religion at all in their curriculum then
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
they would be out of compliance follow
 
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
follow yes how is the financial literacy
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
program uh discriminating against any
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
religion um when it comes to financial
 
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
literacy so I would have to watch all of
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
the videos to see if they're mentioning
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
religion at all but the point is if they
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
aren't mentioning religion then it would
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
be okay if they are mentioning religion
 
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
it would be out of
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
compliance but we could go to KH Academy
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
which is free and is
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
accredited it's accredited through the
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
laws School admission Council if for
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
elsat uh preparation it also provides um
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
K through2 education online for
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers it also provides MCAT
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
education for people trying to go to
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
medical school so so Con Academy is
 
01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.910 align:start position:0%
medical school so so Con Academy is
really

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh a well it has a a good foundation uh
 
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
and it's free and it has a federal uh
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
excuse me a financial literacy course on
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
there as
 
01:04:48.269 --> 01:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
well so there's just not a need to
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
utilize something that discriminates if
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
different but we don't know that it
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
discriminates you you said you didn't
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
know because you haven't watched the
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
course if religion is mentioned isn't
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
that correct so I haven't watched it in
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
its entirety right but I do know that
 
01:05:07.269 --> 01:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:09.269 align:start position:0%
the the
prageru

01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
prageru
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
organization has a religious stance but
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
how would that violate our
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
discrimination laws if this course is
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
being made available and the course does
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
not mention religion how is that the
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
providing of that um course
 
01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:26.839 align:start position:0%
by the State Department of Education
 
01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question um I
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
didn't s state that they don't State
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
religion what I stated was that I
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
haven't watched it in its entirety so we
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
can't confirm nor deny that they don't
 
01:05:49.599 --> 01:05:50.990 align:start position:0%
can't confirm nor deny that they don't
mention

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
mention
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
religion um the but we do know that the
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
organization as a whole has a religious
 
01:06:00.029 --> 01:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
stance and federal fund shouldn't be
 
01:06:03.549 --> 01:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
going to a religious organization unless
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
they are in compliance with the fact
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to teach religion
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
or that they're going to teach all
 
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.510 align:start position:0%
or that they're going to teach all
religions

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
religions
 
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
equally represent
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
belard thank you Mr chair and and thank
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question because it
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
looks to me that this bill would
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
implicate at least a couple Supreme
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
Court cases so I'm looking at the
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision of 2012 in the
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
Evangelical Lutheran Church and School
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
versus the Equal Opportunity uh
 
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
commission that created the magisterial
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
exception that said religious
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
organizations do not um the government
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
cannot cause them to uh be affected by
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws because they
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
have statements of faith that by via the
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
First Amendment via the First Amendment
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
supersede anti-discrimination law and
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
then more
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
recently uh the Carson versus making
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
decision Supreme Court said that that um
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
you cannot prohibit public funds from
 
01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
from flowing to religious-based
 
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
schools um if those funds are to be
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
offered uh to parents at all to allow
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
them to pursue their own educational
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities for their children um so I
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
my question is is this is this bill um
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
seeking to nullify these Supreme Court
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
decisions and either cause
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
religious-based schools in New Hampshire
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
to have to violate their uh statements
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
of Faith or to shut
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
down um thank you for your question and
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
sorry that this speaker
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
is in between us um what I know that the
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill States is that we need to be in
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
compliance with
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
State um Ada recommendations and I read
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
off what they said so not to
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on religion so a
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer for the uh for the Department of
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
Education could answer that
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
further um but I read off what the
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has on their
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
website if I may just to clarify a
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
little further on that answer so you're
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying then that that the point
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
of this bill is not to require the the
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
closure of religious schools receiving
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
public funds according to the Supreme
 
01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
Court decisions so they would have to be
 
01:08:19.719 --> 01:08:20.910 align:start position:0%
Court decisions so they would have to be
in

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
compliance with so if they're going to
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
teach financial literacy for example
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
then they need to maintain their
 
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
language being neutral about religions
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
so they don't teach
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
religion so I have not reviewed their
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
courses in their entirety to know if
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
they never mention religion so if they
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
don't mention religion then it would be
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
in compliance if they do mention
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
religion that's a problem so that's
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's just a clar further I'm not I'm
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
not talking about prayer you I'm talking
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
about religious schools in this state
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
that are receiving EFA funds from
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
students who are pursuing them would
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
those schools have to close as a result
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
bill I don't believe that they would
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
have to close as a result of this bill
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
but I believe that a lawyer for the
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would be able to
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
answer this
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
further are there further questions
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you um I'm
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
wondering about the Ada
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
compliances so um a school that's uh
 
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
approved for tuition purposes I don't
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
think has to have uh for example a
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
wheelchair ramp um built for a Disabled
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
Student to come to their school um would
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
this in fact uh require schools that
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
receive money and again the EFA is
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
optional uh the state is giving money to
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
these to to this program um would they
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
have to comply with
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
Ada um wheelchair ramps elevators they
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
would would have to be in compliance
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
with the Ada recommendations yes thank
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
you on the federal level and the state
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
level yes further
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much do we have
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
around

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
it's good good school to have
 
01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:39.800 align:start position:0%

01:10:59.550 --> 01:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
committee at our state house but what I
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
just heard a few minutes ago deeply
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
Disturbed me and I'm going to say
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
something about it we had we had
 
01:11:07.709 --> 01:11:07.719 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald ask if there was
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
any proof of of violation of those rules
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
in the state and we had someone say
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes and there is no proof of any
 
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
violation by Prager
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
You by her own words she hasn't even
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
watched all of their programs and I
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
think it's disturbing that that she
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
would chair um what what's your
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
question um just just with with regards
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
to referencing an earlier um somebody
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
else's testimony uh the earlier
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that's that's their purview
 
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
and I think the person speaking now
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
everybody's allowed to have their own
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
position their own testimony we all
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
agree on that uh but to speak in an
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to something there's no
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
problem with that um just don't mention
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
the prior person just keep well I I
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
think it was deeply disturbing and
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
unethical and uh I just wanted to put
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
that on the record any further questions
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%

kale bypassing the specific uh item or
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the earlier representative noted
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
the bigger picture of this Bill section
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
one would you agree that Federal
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination and
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws are are a
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
viable part of democracy 100% yeah
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's all thanks yeah any
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you very much are
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
there any other pink cards for this bill
 
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.550 align:start position:0%
there any other pink cards for this bill
just

01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
represent thank you for the record I am
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
Lauren cig I represent the town of
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
Durham which is straford County District
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
10 and I am in support of this bill um
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
which specifically has to do with
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring that um organizations receiving
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
our State dollars are not violating our
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
federal and state anti-discrimination
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
laws um so uh to answer a question that
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
was asked previously would this cause
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
private religious schools to close no
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
they should continue to receive private
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
dollars from their private um uh
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
enrolled students but that doesn't mean
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
that they should be eligible to receive
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
our public funds for their religious
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
education just as I'm sure many of you
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
would not want to be um forced to endure
 
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh Ultra Orthodox religious Jewish
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
Education as some of my family members
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
endured um and other people would not
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
wish to endure uh Ultra Catholic or
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
Ultra Christian or Ultra Muslim or Ultra
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
bahi or Ultra any other religious
 
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
education if it didn't meet their needs
 
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
it also doesn't mean that we should be
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
funding through public dollars those
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
types of private religious organizations
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
um but furthermore in terms of
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination it's not just based
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
on religion um a number of these
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
organizations discriminate People based
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
on their Identity or based on their
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
gender and um I know that it is crucial
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we make sure that we are honoring
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
all of our children and protecting all
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
of our children and using our public
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all children in our state
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
are receiving an education appropriately
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
to them thank you very much represent s
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
do you know of any uh for-profit or
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit entities that are receiving
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
public dollars that are discriminating
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
um I I I have not taken the time to do
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
specific research about this bill I just
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
was responding to the questions
 
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
previously I know that when my now high
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
school graduate was um looking at and
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
applying to private schools we toward uh
 
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
private religious schools that were not
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
of our faith um and she was
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
fundamentally told well you can come
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
here but you're not going to be allowed
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
to do things the way you like or the way
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
you think you should and was told
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
fundamentally that um her religion was
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
wrong completely um not that they were a
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
welcoming space and I would not
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
therefore have submitted my private
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
dollars to them and would certainly hope
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
that our public dollars weren't going
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
there either thank you uh represent
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
cordelli and then represent belon thank
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
you I just wondering about your opinion
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
um on this because um we've heard
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
testimony about um private excuse me
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
you're not you've already had testimony
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative G you're not supposed to
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
be sitting at that
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
chair um testimony about um students um
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
with EFA accounts um going to private
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
religious schools but this isn't a
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
different section of law this is not
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
under the education Freedom account
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
program which is uh RSA
 
01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
194 so I'm just wondering how does this
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
apply to that because this is talking
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
about um credits for
 
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
graduation uh from a a public school it
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to me so I'm not sure how this
 
01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
applies to um uh funds um from parents
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
going to an uh to a school um based on
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that this is
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
about granting credit leading to
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
graduation and any place that leads to
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
credit for graduation whether it's
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
full-time or part-time um would would
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
fit under that as in my understanding
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
but again I'm I'm not an attorney and I
 
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
don't play one on TV thank you thank you
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
represent Bel thank you Mr chair and
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to take this
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
question which is again again it goes to
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
the idea of this particularly the
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case Carson versus makan
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
out of 2022 where the Supreme Court
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
specifically said because they struck
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
down a main provision that would seem to
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
be very similar to this law that said
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
you cannot
 
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
utilize um public funds toward any sort
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
of religious education but the Supreme
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
Court said you can't do that you have to
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
if you're going to allow any public
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
funds to be utilized by parents toward
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
any type of education you cannot exclude
 
01:17:17.229 --> 01:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
religious organizations and religious
 
01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
organizations cannot be subject to
 
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination law so is is the
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
point of this bill in your your mind to
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
nullify this Supreme Court decision from
 
01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
2022 I I would never presume to um
 
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
nullify a Supreme Court
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
leus since this would apply to any
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
organization that
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
gives that a child can use to get
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
credit would an organization that the
 
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
parent paid for that was Private that
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
parent paid for their own
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
money still have to follow this I mean
 
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's not public money at all oh again
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
I didn't draft the bill and I'm I'm
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
speaking about what I heard and I'm
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
speaking about the content of what I've
 
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
read in the bill and so my understanding
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
and my belief is that we shouldn't be
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
providing any public funds to any
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
organization that that does that
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
um whether someone privately wants to do
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
that I I don't know how that relates to
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
this bill I can't answer your question
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing it thank you very
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
you represent given you've had your
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity do you have a followup I do
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question if there
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
is no public funds going to the organiz
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
to the school the
 
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
organization um then no they don't need
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
to then that coincides with the Supreme
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
Court decision where they don't have to
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
be subject to these the these new laws
 
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
it's when there's Public Funding going
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
into it that they end up having to be in
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
compliance with the um the laws as
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're written uh the other thing I
 
01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
just want to throw out there is that I'm
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
not against P private schools first of
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
all I sent my older son to dairyfield
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
and he graduated there from there last
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
year here and my younger son is
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
currently in a charter school so I'm not
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
against private schools as a whole I
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
just am advocating for um students with
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
any kind of disability or that are
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
discriminated against in any fashion
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we're gonna I follow
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
up no represent Pentel thank you and
 
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
said you send your son to a charter
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
school is that a private school no
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
Charter in the state is public
 
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
um but they do fall under different
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
rules and guidelines than the rest of
 
01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
the um Public Schools so I'm I'm
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
definitely an advocate for for parents
 
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs of their children they
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
the parents know their child best and
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
they know
 
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
what their child needs as far as the
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
education there are different forms of
 
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
Education that are out there for
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
different students which is great
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
to be honest but if we're using public
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
funds they need to be in compliance with
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws I mean this is
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
this is really straightforward so
 
01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.910 align:start position:0%
this is really straightforward so
represent

01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:41.719 align:start position:0%
leus can you show me where it limits
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
this to public funds because I see no
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
reference to public funds let me just
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
quick

01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
oh I see what you're I see what you're
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
saying um if you would like or if the
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
committee would want me to put in an an
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to make that a little bit more
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
clear then I can do that I'm happy to do
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
that or since it's in the committee's
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
hand now um you guys could do that I
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
guess thank you represent dry thank you
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
question um can you help me out if if
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
a school takes one student with public
 
01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
funds now are they El obliged to do it
 
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
all right no matter how what the
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
population is of the school correct okay
 
01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.629 align:start position:0%
population is of the school correct okay
further

01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
questions that was the point of the the
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill if the wording was a little bit off
 
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
then we can fix that with an amendment
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
Horgan pardon
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:53.870 align:start position:0%
Horgan pardon
me

01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
this is yeah we're on 16005 and you have
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
a pink card in 16005 y well that's
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
right I just wanted to very quickly uh
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
agree with those who've advocated for
 
01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
1605 I don't think this would uh put
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
religious schools out of business um
 
01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:14.990 align:start position:0%
religious schools out of business um
there

01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
is regardless even if they you know
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
launder the money or don't accept direct
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
funding if we do
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
allow um any organization into you know
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
this uh to be have their content Beed
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
for adequate education that we are at
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
least uh someone doing State subsidies
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
so I think um we have the right and even
 
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
the duty to uh enforce
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws and we seem to
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
be talking about religion just because a
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
school or any other group calls itself a
 
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
religion doesn't um doesn't give it the
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
right to uh doesn't give it the right to
 
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
discriminate and actually um getting
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
involved these programs may not be good
 
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:55.719 align:start position:0%
for a lot of the religious groups
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
because then you know they are
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
subjecting themselves to State uh
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
regulations so you know there I usually
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
think of the uh Federal First Amendment
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
more as a separation served it came to
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
my Judiciary Committee on an issue I
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to go to details of which
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
isue was but one that turns up in
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
several committees and he said you know
 
01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:15.639 align:start position:0%
the I mean he gave us somewhat a
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
strongman version of what the left's
 
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
position on the issue is and said this
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
is a religion for them so I um thought I
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
was being very smart
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
um asked him asked him a question you
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
know like does that mean that
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
this what what the left position is that
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
protect protected by the First Amendment
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
he said no no no the there's he admitted
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
there's limits to in that case he said
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know that doesn't give it a right to
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
abuse children so that's um so I think
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
this bill protects both the taxpayers
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
and the religious schools and any other
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
organization wants to participate in
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
this program so I think this is a good
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill so thank you are there any
 
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
chair good morning representative thanks
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
for being back in education line 11 of
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
the bill says the entities and
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
non-compliance shall be referred to the
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission do you believe
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
that that might be a bit of a stretch in
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
violation of this law or is that the
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate place to refer someone to um
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
it could be if someone feels strongly
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
enough um we've actually over in
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
judiciary we've been um dealing with the
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
law and then also just the policies and
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
how to run the human rights commission
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
and um so it uh you know it's it's far
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
from perfect but uh it does work
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
sometime and actually they do um have a
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
policy of trying to solve things you
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
know make the Agri parties uh come to an
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
agreement um amongst themselves rather
 
01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
than going through the whole hearing
 
01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
process so that's um I I don't think the
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
human rights Human Rights Commission is
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
not terrible but I think it's uh may not
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
there maybe some some cases where that's
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate if it's an extreme case so
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee no see
 
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and with that we're
 
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
going to close down the hearing for
 
01:25:06.109 --> 01:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
6:05 and we'll start our next hearing up
 
01:25:06.119 --> 01:25:21.270 align:start position:0%
6:05 and we'll start our next hearing up

10:30

01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead with the
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%

01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
organ thank you and I think I well my
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
name was announ you all know who
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
everybody here knows who I am anyway but
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
just for the record I'm represent
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%

County District 10 which is the uh town
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
of Durham so I'm here to introduce HB
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
1592 FNL I'm printing around I'm passing
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
around copies of my printed testimony
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
which I also emailed to the committee
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
and put on the portal on the website so
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
all of you've seen it at least I'm sure
 
01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
you've all like already read it twice
 
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
and absorbed everything in it but I'll
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead and speak to you anyway and I
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's a relative to the use of Education
 
01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.470 align:start position:0%
it's a relative to the use of Education
Freedom

01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
Freedom
 
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
accounts in religious schools and it's
 
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
basically trying to ban it which I know
 
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
is not not exactly universally popular
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
idea there's not counting the last
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
section with the effective date which
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
would be July 1st
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
2024 um it would be uh yeah there's
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
three sections actually I'll just skip
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
very quickly had to section two because
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
there two things which aren't as
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
controversial as
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
section um
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
section two is the part about the
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
funding religious goals that's the most
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
controversial part I haven't gotten any
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
emails about it apparently you're
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
getting bombarded with emails and phone
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
calls about it
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
um I can emphasize I'm there's a couple
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
bills over in judiciary that we're
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
getting bombarded with but um so just
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
skipping very quickly ahead to the to
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
the last paragraph of my testimony uh
 
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
section one stipulates the higher
 
01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
education institutions receiving um I'll
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
call them EFA funds education Freedom
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
count for school vouchers depending on
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
which term you prefer to use um anyways
 
01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
say higher education institutes would
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
have to be accredited
 
01:36:33.149 --> 01:36:33.159 align:start position:0%
and the two relevant available reports
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
on who the vendors are that are
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
receiving these funds and they're both
 
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
as of 20 end of 2022 so they're kind of
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
outdated and they're not uh they're not
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily designed for people like me
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
to try to analyze it but um there's only
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
a few colleges and universities on the
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
vendor list and they all appear to be
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
accredited with the possible exception
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
of something called Ontario universities
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
but they got one grant for
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
$193 so they're not really a major part
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
of the program um and also section three
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
takes out special legal protections
 
01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
granted to EFA recipients and to the
 
01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization itself and
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's uh being the Judiciary Committee
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
um that uh that part of it doesn't
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily sit that well with me but um
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
so and hence hence Force if you use this
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
program to violate the law or violate
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
anyone else's Constitution or common law
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
rights you could be held liable just
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
like anyone else who misuses the
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayer's money or guess AB or so
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's um that's what those two things
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
are about and those might espe those two
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
things might stand without the uh rest
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill in
 
01:37:48.750 --> 01:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
case case as you uh case as you work on
 
01:37:51.149 --> 01:37:51.159 align:start position:0%
it you change in case you feel Maybe
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
maybe those parts of it have some Merit
 
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
you can consider those separately um so
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
it would forbid using the money for
 
01:37:58.119 --> 01:38:00.109 align:start position:0%
it would forbid using the money for
Religious

01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
Religious
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
Education um and I believe this art
 
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
program violates several articles of the
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
State Constitution especially part 1
 
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
article 6 and I guess I don't need to
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
read the whole thing it's in the written
 
01:38:09.719 --> 01:38:11.109 align:start position:0%
read the whole thing it's in the written
testimony

01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
um we'll parenthetically know the Carson
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
case came up in which is a US Supreme
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
Court about Maine I
 
01:38:20.589 --> 01:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
um I didn't mention the first amendment
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
of my test precise because that case was
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
recently decided I think that was
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
specific to a main law which I think is
 
01:38:30.589 --> 01:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
different from both what's being dealt
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
with in this bill and the subject matter
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
of the previous bill so we don't
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily know the Supreme Court if it
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
was asked to Pine on it would overturn
 
01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
this if this became law um so we I think
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's worth I don't think that in itself
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
is an argument for killing the bill but
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't merely allow St anyway
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
the program which is embodied in RSA
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
194f um doesn't merely allow taxpayer
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
funds to be used support religious
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
education it actively encourages that
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
and actually the same could be used
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
about the education tax credit program
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
um which actually this bill doesn't
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
address at all um that one's a little
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
bit different it doesn't take money
 
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
directly from the general education fund
 
01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
so it's limited to the amount
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
voluntarily paid into it by the
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
participating taxpayers and um those are
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
I guess uh see sff enough differences I
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
decided not to attack that not to like
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
do anything about that program in this
 
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:30.679 align:start position:0%
bill both those two programs are
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
currently administered to a nonprofit
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
corporation called the children's
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund New Hampshire which
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
actually is ironically Incorporated in
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
New York City does have an office in
 
01:39:40.599 --> 01:39:42.189 align:start position:0%
New York City does have an office in
conquered

01:39:42.189 --> 01:39:42.199 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
um but uh it's uh Incorporated in New
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
York City and they did actually the
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
parent organization did actually set up
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
a separate um cour entity just to
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
administer um the activities in New
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so even though it's part of a
 
01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.390 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so even though it's part of a
larger

01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
organization located in New York City
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
that uh is active in several other
 
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.550 align:start position:0%
that uh is active in several other
states

01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
um and I was a little bit suspicious I
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
want to first arrived here because it's
 
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
a very small organization um
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
administering a pretty complicated
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
entitlement program and basically on a
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
Cost Plus basis they seem to be just
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
getting a guaranteed percentage of
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
what's spent through the program um and
 
01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
they hav't really been any scandals yet
 
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
there been scandals with similar prros
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
to other states but this one hasn't
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
really been a problem but I'm dubious of
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
it um you know especially with
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
the um especially the larger much more
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
ambitious School voucher program has
 
01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
been added on top of that old tax credit
 
01:40:40.270 --> 01:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
and U it's growing um almost out of
 
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
control I think so
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
it the CFS NH and the program it's
 
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
serves some home schools and secular
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
private schools but its main mission is
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
support religious education and they
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
really don't make any bones about you
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
look in their website you know they've
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
got the banner on the front page there a
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of adorable little children
 
01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
apparently parochial school uniforms
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
with those bright yellow scarves that we
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
see on session days all the time will
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly see it on the day that this
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
bill comes to the floor um so they're um
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know they're very upfront about what
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing um what what their purpose
 
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
is and their conquered office is
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually literally located on the
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
property of the Catholic Church on
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
Lowden Road although we'll say it's
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
appears to be just looking from the
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
outside a pretty small office in a
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
church basement so I guess maybe they're
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
not wasting a lot of the taxpayers money
 
01:41:33.149 --> 01:41:33.159 align:start position:0%
but um so as I said I think this is just
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
a blatant violation of the State
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution you know and the name
 
01:41:38.669 --> 01:41:38.679 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of it's also a bad
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
policy one of the big reasons um is he
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
gives the power to reward some religions
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
which is thees of while punishing those
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
it disapproves of cuz you know there's
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh this organization I I don't know if
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
they've denied any would be religious
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
Educators but U they certainly have they
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
certainly have the power to do so and
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
there's not much accountability or
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's no um you know they're not even
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
subject to uh 91a the right to no law so
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
it's hard and um so I was in the
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2012 when the ETC the
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
educ tax program was created and then of
 
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
course in 20 also 2021 when it was the
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
program we're talking about to they it
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
was created as part of the budget
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill and um I believe they put
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization into that
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
program as administrator precisely with
 
01:42:29.229 --> 01:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
the expectation they would be exempt
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
from many of the state and federal
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
regulations which is agency like the
 
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
State Department of Education would have
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
to obey so
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
I'm maybe that shouldn't be uh trying
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
top people's motives are but that
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely is of course the effect of
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
the bill as it was passed and there's I
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
was not the legislation 1995 with the
 
01:42:49.629 --> 01:42:49.639 align:start position:0%
charged school public charged public
 
01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
school programs established
 
01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
but the laws governing that program
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
they've changed very little over the
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
past three decades um there is a bill to
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
tweak that program a little bit uh Miss
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
represent Horan can you stick to this
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill please not talking charter schools
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
here yes I'm just saying um that program
 
01:43:08.589 --> 01:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
religious schools were Exempted from
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
that program almost 30 years ago and
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
um so okay I guess I can't put in a good
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
word for the bill about that which is
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
coming up here so the program recent
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
growth it's been pretty spectacular
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
almost entirely out of control um in my
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
opinion this would reduce the C amounted
 
01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
by a significant amount certainly more
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
than half as I said the relevant data is
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
a couple years
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
old presented for format it makes it
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
hard to eventually analyze and um I
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have I made a little bit of
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
effort to see what else DOA can provide
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
me they referred me to CSF and I just uh
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
decided to stick with what was on the
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
website so I did a very crude analysis
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
of report called nhed by vendor spending
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
released in January 2023 which covers
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
expenditures apparently from November
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
2021 to June 202nd which shows that at
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
least 54% of the EFA dollars are being
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
spent paid directly to religious
 
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
institutions and I think that's actually
 
01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
an understatement since um only about a
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
third of the program appears to be uh
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
most most a lot of the program is not
 
01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
being spent directly on on tuition and
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
the uh tuition grants is shown in that
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
report and another one are usually less
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
than the full amount of the uh grants
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
that the families are receiving and it's
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
obviously less than the uh Less in the
 
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
cost of to these organizations um and I
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
have a list I have a list here of I
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
listed uh the I flagged all the schools
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
that appear to be religious judging by
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
their names or what I could glean about
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
them the you had to go down to about
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
number 10 on the list before you got a
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
non-religious school which is a school
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
called the high mowing School in Wilton
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
um and actually actually has a secular
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
that does have sort of a spiritual
 
01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint it's clearly a secular school
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
um a few others but the the all the
 
01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
largest users of it are either parochial
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
schools or Christian Christian academies
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
organizations which are very
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
specifically religious schools which um
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily a bad thing I don't
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
really know if that's either
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional or appropriate to use the
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer to directly support
 
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
those organizations but so that's um I
 
01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
actually think this bill will probably C
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
of a lot more than 54% of the program
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
probably at least 75% or so because
 
01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
um you know it would still leave secular
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
schools would still be so family senors
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
students of secular private schools like
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
the H mowing School the Philips heor
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
Academy has a few students in there and
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
a few others then also homeschoolers but
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
not the religious schools so that's um
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's my bill it's kind of simple in
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
principle and
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
um in case anybody ask me about the
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision that applies to
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
the main law which I think is different
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
than what we're considering here so I I
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
think I think this might pass thank you
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for represent
 
01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli yeah um thank you
 
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Horgan for
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
being here again and and yes we did
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
recognize the name yes um the um the
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
subject um you brought it up and was
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
brought back brought up in context of
 
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
the earlier Bill also was the uh Carson
 
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
versus Mak decision but there are
 
01:46:32.669 --> 01:46:32.679 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions going back um as
 
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
that I know of as far as back as 1925
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
Pierce Versus Society of
 
01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
sisters um all and you you can you don't
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
have to write all this down it's all on
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
my website repeal New Hampshire bla.com
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
yes I'll put in a plug um I know I know
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
Senator Blain he's been dead for a long
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
time but I know who he is yeah Blaine of
 
01:46:58.750 --> 01:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
Maine yeah um in the 1990s there was
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
zelman versus Simmons Harris then
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
Trinity Lutheran versus comr yeah which
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
was all about trying to give um rubber
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh materials for school playgrounds to a
 
01:47:16.750 --> 01:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
religious school that was um argued um
 
01:47:18.669 --> 01:47:18.679 align:start position:0%
as being uh
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
then there more recently the past um
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
four years there was Espinosa versus
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
Montana Department of
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue um and then Carson versus Min
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
all of them held that if um funds are
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to a private school it would be
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
discrimination to exclude religious
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
schools um it would it I can give you
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
the quotes from Supreme Court justic
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
Roberts about it's being
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
neutral um to uh respect from for
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
religion um when this happens it's not a
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
violation of The Establishment Clause um
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering
 
01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
how how you um you've mentioned that um
 
01:48:17.229 --> 01:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
uh section three um on lines 5 through 7
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
um complies with our state constitution
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering how you um get around
 
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.589 --> 01:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
decisions I mean I guess I'll just say
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
my reading of it is blatantly violates
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
what's in our state constitution and we
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and as for the rest of those probably
 
01:48:41.589 --> 01:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
before you execu you may want to have a
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
work session and review you know have a
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
have a discussion of those of those
 
01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
decisions I I'm familiar with some of
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
them not familiar with others and um so
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's probably about the best answer I
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
have I just don't believe from what are
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
there any other question seen that those
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
invalidate my my law represent cordelli
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just wanted to bring up
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
you also touched in your testimony and I
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
believe you mentioned uh part one
 
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
article six of the
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution um uh the compelled reason
 
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
Clause it's commonly referred to and I'm
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
just wondering if if you're aware of the
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
history of that why it was added to the
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution um it was because back in
 
01:49:23.639 --> 01:49:24.510 align:start position:0%
Constitution um it was because back in
the

01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
1700s towns were collecting Char uh
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
collecting money for the
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
churches um predominantly the
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
congregational churches and um in 1784
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
this was added to the Constitution so
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
you couldn't compel someone to pay money
 
01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:47.719 align:start position:0%
to the Congregational Church but in
 
01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
1791 there was a law passed that that
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
allowed towns to do this that was
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
eventually repealed in
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
1819 as other faiths started objecting
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
to uh collecting money for the
 
01:50:05.149 --> 01:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
congregational churches they you know
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
they felt the you know they should have
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh equal uh equal dibs on that taxpayer
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
dollars I guess but um so that's the
 
01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
history of article
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
one part one article six so I'm not sure
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
how that
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
um applies to um your attempt in uh
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 to exclude monies from um
 
01:50:29.159 --> 01:50:30.390 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 to exclude monies from um
religious

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
schools I I mean I might respectfully
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
disagree with the with the history um I
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
only been the legislation in 2008 so a
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
lot of those events happened uh before
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
my service um I guarantee you I wasn't
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
around in uh
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
184 I mean I I um there was the
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
separation of church and state you know
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
didn't really exist in the uh 1700s and
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
they kind of that evolved you know in
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
the middle of the 19th century and to
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
some extent I think it's because the uh
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
the churches didn't want to be uh part
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
of the state as much as the state uh
 
01:51:07.069 --> 01:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to be separate from the churches
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
so a little of both and so there was a
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
move away move away from directly
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
subsidizing religious schools so they
 
01:51:14.589 --> 01:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
still existed with private funding and
 
01:51:16.830 --> 01:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
they do get a lot of uh tax advantages
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
so that's uh that's from my answer once
 
01:51:21.069 --> 01:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
again you have an executive session
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
coming up you probably could if you
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to although have many bills have
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
a work session to like more examine
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
those Court decisions in more detail are
 
01:51:31.709 --> 01:51:31.719 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for repres H
 
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
and represent McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
chair I am going to cut to the chase if
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
a law-abiding family is paying their
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
taxes and part of those taxes goes
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
towards funding public education and the
 
01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
EFA program is designed to reimburse
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
some of that tax money back to the
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
family then why shouldn't they be able
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
to put their tax dollars towards a
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
religious school or whatever else they
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
all once again you have an executive
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
session coming up so you can discuss
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
that amongst yourselves I I believe the
 
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
tax mayor money belongs to all the
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers not just you know so and in
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
some cases some of these families are
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in fact especially if
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
they're U within the original purview of
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
the EFA program they uh they wouldn't be
 
01:52:24.589 --> 01:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily paying enough taxes to the
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
state to um you know offset what what's
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
being what's being paid as the grants
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
from the EFA program so and then also
 
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
course the EA program just the way it's
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
designed is a little bit my opinion kind
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
of kind of strange and open to abuse but
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
yes so I would I don't have a good
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
answer better answer than that but you
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
can discuss that amongst yourselves at
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
the exact questions from the committee
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative Luna thank you very much
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
um are
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
you being I mean being the being the
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bill are you aware
 
01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
that back in February actually February
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
15 2022 there was a letter from the
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education to the Joint
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%

01:53:55.599 --> 01:53:57.470 align:start position:0%
are you under the impression that um
that

01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
there that at least that direcor from
 
01:54:02.589 --> 01:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to JL car is not being
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
followed by some uh EF some taxpayer
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
funded Education Service I would say so
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay thank you further questions
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent Horgan I'd
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:32.229 align:start position:0%
 
suton

01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
hey good morning for the record my name
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
is Matt suton um director of policy and
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
compliance at Children's scholarship
 
01:54:41.790 --> 01:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
fund uh so we have a few questions on
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
this bill we would oppose this bill
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
because frankly it strips out the
 
01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
protections for providers and we believe
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
that if we were put in that position we
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
would have to discriminate against
 
01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
providers and as I just said the law
 
01:54:59.069 --> 01:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
explicitly has protections for those
 
01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
providers currently um I know that you
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
have tried to unpack Espinosa and Carson
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
and we believe that the state or we
 
01:55:09.390 --> 01:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
believe that the US Supreme Court has
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
made it clear if you have a private
 
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
school choice program you can't
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
discriminate against uh religious
 
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
institutions so that's all I have thank
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
you very much other questions for Mr
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
Southern yes represent lus are you aware
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
of any monies actually going to
 
01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:29.550 align:start position:0%
of any monies actually going to
religious

01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
training I do not that was an
 
01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:33.800 align:start position:0%
interesting question that I heard would
 
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
that be I mean I would just be
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
speculating is that like Bible study is
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
that what they're talking about because
 
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
alls alls that we would pay for would be
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
tuition to a to a non-public school and
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
again we can't make those value
 
01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
judgments we can't say you know as long
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
as you're approved by the bo Board of
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
Education you're approved by the entity
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
in your state to operate and we vetted
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
you we can't make moral or or or value
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
judgments on well we're going to we're
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
going to allow this one and we're not
 
01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
going to allow that one it specifically
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
says in the law that we can't do that so
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
and this would strip that out so that's
 
01:56:09.870 --> 01:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
what concerns us thank you represent
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
Cordell did you have your hand pass any
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
further representative McDonald thank
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you so much for
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
being here I had something I wanted to
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
clarify the previous representative said
 
01:56:24.589 --> 01:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
that the current law as is may allow the
 
01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to choose to
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
fund one religious school as opposed to
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
another type of religious school may not
 
01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:33.639 align:start position:0%
be funded but I just want to clarify
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
that's not the case and you can't
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on religion yeah no
 
01:56:39.629 --> 01:56:39.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's absolutely not the case
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much law F questions
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you Mr chair it
 
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
it was noted obviously the the case Mak
 
01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
was was implicated in this and uh but it
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
was suggested that that is not a reason
 
01:56:53.550 --> 01:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
to kill this bill but if I were to look
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
at our house rules under 45 section D no
 
01:56:58.750 --> 01:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
committee shall Report with a positive
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation any bill or resolution
 
01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
which would if enacted be a violation of
 
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
any article of the Constitution of New
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the Constitution of the
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
United States do you believe that this
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
bill if enacted would be
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional well I mean I'm not a
 
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional scholar but that's that's
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
what we're afraid of yeah that we'd be
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
breaking the law and that we'd be
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
discriminating against certain
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.069 align:start position:0%
discriminating against certain
individuals

01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:57:20.079 --> 01:57:21.589 align:start position:0%
individuals

01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%

01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
Boni thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:57:26.109 --> 01:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just wondering
 
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
if you could speak a little bit to your
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
vetting process because um we don't
 
01:57:33.069 --> 01:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
really have access to that so I'm just
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
curious how you decide and we're
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely happy to share that process
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
with you it's a series of questions that
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
the um that one of our staff has to go
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
through you would you would you would
 
01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
receive the application and you would
 
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
make sure it's a legitimate entity a
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate person say if it's it's a
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
little bit different if you're a sole
 
01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
proprietor right and you're not a you're
 
01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
not an organization how would we vet to
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that you have the credentials
 
01:57:58.750 --> 01:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
and the experience to be able to teach
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
that job right so we would ask for your
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
resume we'd want ask for your work
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
experience we'd ask for any other
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
relative relative documentation and then
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
of course we have another we
 
01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
would it's a little uncomfortable to say
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
this but we we we use the national insta
 
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
check for you know sexual predators so
 
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
we we do all that because you know what
 
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
we want to do is we want to make sure
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
that these are safe providers that these
 
01:58:27.149 --> 01:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
that these students go to and ultimately
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's the parents decision to represent
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
Choice uh just a quick followup thank
 
01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
you um so is it a committee that does
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
the vetting process is a a small I mean
 
01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
is it one person it's it's typically
 
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
myself and then another member of the
 
01:58:44.990 --> 01:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
compliance team and I'm absolutely happy
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
to email you that the instructions on
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
how we
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
proceed Prof ananana thank you is that
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
information um publicly available um not
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
just the questions but actually the
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
process well the process but also the
 
01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
schools that you vet um is that
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
information publicly available their
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
their responses it's interesting so as
 
01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
part of that as part of that um RFP that
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
we submitted last year we we we are
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
implementing a new process
 
01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
that every um provider will need to um
 
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
when they when they register for for the
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
program and if we approve them then they
 
01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
will have to lay out a number of those
 
01:59:32.069 --> 01:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
documents there including how do they
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
provide a safe learning environment for
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
their student and and will those
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
documents be publicly available
 
01:59:39.149 --> 01:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely they will be publicly
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
available and is this are you talking as
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
long as there I mean as long as we're
 
01:59:45.629 --> 01:59:45.639 align:start position:0%
not talking about you know personal
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%

just talking about that not the
 
01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely and you can look at our new
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures we just updated
 
02:00:02.189 --> 02:00:02.199 align:start position:0%
those a few weeks ago um that's online a
 
02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
lot of that is I mean pretty much
 
02:00:05.550 --> 02:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
everything should be public and if there
 
02:00:08.069 --> 02:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
is information that you want or require
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
please let us know because we'll be
 
02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
putting together an annual report at the
 
02:00:13.950 --> 02:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of each year as a look back
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
um so that you'll be able to see all
 
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
these cost categories where the money
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
was spent uh the different vendors and
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
and all of those further
 
02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:24.910 align:start position:0%
and all of those further
questions

02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
represo thank you very much Mr chair has
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
the uh children's scholarship fund um
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
approved any expenses uh under the EFA
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
program for religious instruction not
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of materials or services
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
used for religious
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
instruction I think are you talking
 
02:00:44.430 --> 02:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
about I mean I I literally have to ask
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
you are you talking about a Bible or
 
02:00:48.189 --> 02:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
what what could you define that for yeah
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
so so in the in the commissioner's um
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
own words in a letter to the uh to J car
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh set forth above the department
 
02:01:00.270 --> 02:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
believes that as enacted the EFA law
 
02:01:03.149 --> 02:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
does not permit the use of EFA funds for
 
02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
religious instruction correct so that's
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
a that's an absolute statement yeah
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding so so I I just
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that the children's
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund has not approved any
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
EFA um any expenses under the EFA
 
02:01:18.719 --> 02:01:19.790 align:start position:0%
EFA um any expenses under the EFA
program

02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
for Educational Services or materials
 
02:01:26.069 --> 02:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
that are being used for religious
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
instruction not to my knowledge but
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
again that's such a subjective question
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
I would need you to Define it so for
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
example is um is a
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
religious history textbook would that
 
02:01:41.229 --> 02:01:41.239 align:start position:0%
be an item that you're describing so for
 
02:01:42.910 --> 02:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
example we would consider that history
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
right we again we don't make value
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
judgments on how they want to teach
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
their students because they these are
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
these are approved non-public schools by
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
the state so so this this really gets
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
followup gets to religious instruction
 
02:02:00.510 --> 02:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm just using the
 
02:02:03.870 --> 02:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner's words here in this letter
 
02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
back in February of 2022 to JL car and
 
02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
and I I guess I'm just interested to
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
know whether or not the um children's
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund has approved the use of
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
EFA funds for any Educational Services I
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
believe is what it's called in
 
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
194f um Educational Services and
 
02:02:28.069 --> 02:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
materials are part of Educational
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
Services um to be used for religious
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
instruction because the commissioner
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
here says that the rules and the Law
 
02:02:39.149 --> 02:02:39.159 align:start position:0%
194f Bar the use of EFA funds for
 
02:02:39.159 --> 02:02:40.430 align:start position:0%
194f Bar the use of EFA funds for
religious

02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
religious
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
instruction so to my knowledge no and
 
02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
again I would I would need to go back
 
02:02:48.189 --> 02:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
and I need to check yeah and I would
 
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely definitely love to read the
 
02:02:52.069 --> 02:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
material that you're reading and then
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
read um you know do we have a definition
 
02:02:56.430 --> 02:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
on what those materials are thank you
 
02:02:59.310 --> 02:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
very much thank you uh not see any
 
02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
further questions I'd like to invite
 
02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:10.390 align:start position:0%
further questions I'd like to invite
Aubrey

02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
Freeman uh Mr chairman committee members
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman I live in Bridgewater
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
private citizen I speak in opposition to
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
this bill um so one of my points I was
 
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
going to make we already talked about
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
the uh Supreme Court US Supreme Court
 
02:03:28.990 --> 02:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
already ruled an Espinosa versus the uh
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
Montana Department of Revenue so that
 
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
was June 2020 so that's pretty clear you
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
have to be neutral on religious schools
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
and school voucher programs so that's
 
02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
all so to me this would just be a waste
 
02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
of time this whole bill but my more
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
important points are actually this would
 
02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:49.950 align:start position:0%
important points are actually this would
remove

02:03:49.950 --> 02:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
remove
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
government schools just don't work out
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
for everybody so that's what school
 
02:03:55.709 --> 02:03:55.719 align:start position:0%
choice is all about If you eliminate
 
02:03:58.910 --> 02:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
like 75% of the options what are those
 
02:04:02.589 --> 02:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
parents going to do so this is removing
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
choices we want more choices not less
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
choices so that's the problem right here
 
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
secondly um I'm Jewish and when my son
 
02:04:14.189 --> 02:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
he went to a regular government school
 
02:04:17.229 --> 02:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
back in California K through 5 then I
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
decided no I don't think this is going
 
02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
to the best option moving forward after
 
02:04:23.709 --> 02:04:23.719 align:start position:0%
Elementary School I sent him to a
 
02:04:27.629 --> 02:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
Catholic school and I have absolutely no
 
02:04:31.629 --> 02:04:31.639 align:start position:0%
interest in Catholicism I had to go to
 
02:04:34.549 --> 02:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
services and they were swinging that
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
weird smoke around and I know nothing
 
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
about that but I didn't care about any
 
02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
of that the school had really high
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
standards the a went down to like 94% 93
 
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
was already in the E I said wo these
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
people have high standards academic
 
02:04:55.870 --> 02:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
standards that's what I'm interested in
 
02:04:59.709 --> 02:04:59.719 align:start position:0%
so the religious part people choose
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
religious schools for all different
 
02:05:06.549 --> 02:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
reasons and um certainly for me I had no
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
interest in that but so he did you know
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
there was one class on religion it
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
didn't hurt him to learn it but it was a
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
good school and I think removing that
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
option is going to be devastating for
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
lot of parents who frankly I go to
 
02:05:22.069 --> 02:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
school board meetings I know what goes
 
02:05:25.229 --> 02:05:25.239 align:start position:0%
on in the schools they're not that good
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
people need other options and this
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
removes it so um uh even though I think
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
it be thrown out of court and every you
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
know just won't work but um it's a bad
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
idea and that's why I oppos this Bill
 
02:05:38.189 --> 02:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are you willing to
 
02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions yes yes questions
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee not see any thank you
 
02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
very much and the last card I have here
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
is Jay Cole cook cook okay
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay wor when they mix up those last
 
02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:55.189 align:start position:0%

letters
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
well looks like a different type of
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
writing I'm not good at that either
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
welcome this is amazing it's my first
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
time in front of anything like this and
 
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
I I can't believe I'm here I'm age 60 I
 
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
grew up in New Hampshire I did win a Dar
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh essay once uh why I love America when
 
02:06:14.910 --> 02:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
I was like in fifth grade think it was
 
02:06:17.189 --> 02:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
$10 Prize or something but this is the
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
closest I've gotten since then I've
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
spent about 30 years over uh Seas with
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
the military uh when I came back I
 
02:06:25.709 --> 02:06:25.719 align:start position:0%
started a family late cuz uh during the
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
the wars we were extremely busy we
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
weren't you know making families so uh I
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
have young kids uh when I got back I
 
02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
moved into what was considered to be one
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
of the nicer I mean you know it was an
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
apartment in a you know a multif family
 
02:06:41.709 --> 02:06:41.719 align:start position:0%
unit but it was still in a neighborhood
 
02:06:44.189 --> 02:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
that I presume was assigned to a good
 
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
Public School my mother is a had taught
 
02:06:49.069 --> 02:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
at that school my sister is a public
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
school teacher in New Hampshire now my
 
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
cousin I have many friends who are
 
02:06:53.950 --> 02:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
public school teachers uh I know for a
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
fact that there's some excellent lots of
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
excellent public schools in the
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh it's a terrible
 
02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
thing when you're a father and you're
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
assigned to a
 
02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
totally failed public school like Mount
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
Pleasant in nashwa and that's not the
 
02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
only one in
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
nashwa it's a terrible thing uh
 
02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
to to think because you don't have money
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
and like a lot of immigrants my wife is
 
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
an immigrant um because you don't have
 
02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
the money to send your kids to a private
 
02:07:28.990 --> 02:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
school that you have to consign them to
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
a failed public school and I'm not
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
talking about failed like you know I
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
don't like the look of it or uh you know
 
02:07:36.669 --> 02:07:36.679 align:start position:0%
I don't like the feel it I'm talking
 
02:07:40.109 --> 02:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
about go to the doe website and check
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
the measurements which a lot of people
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
don't do and it's starting to look like
 
02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:46.350 align:start position:0%
don't do and it's starting to look like
almost

02:07:46.350 --> 02:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
almost
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
like like the legislature that people
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea of school choice at
 
02:07:54.669 --> 02:07:54.679 align:start position:0%
all are uh are just throwing eggs just
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
throwing stones just anything they're
 
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
just trying to make something stick to
 
02:07:58.990 --> 02:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
to end these
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
programs um like Mr I think fre Freedman
 
02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
sir is it said uh you know my kids are
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
not Catholic my wife is not Catholic um
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
the school um I volunteer in it two
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
mornings a week before I go to my own
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
um stuff and I just uh I it's it's more
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
diverse than some Public Schools
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
especially in all in a very heavily
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
white New Hampshire there's tons of
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
Indians there's atheist Chinese in there
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
there there are Orthodox Jews Muslim
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
family um it's uh and so whatever
 
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
discussion is about religion there there
 
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
is a class they do teach a religion
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
class I don't want to be taking a knock
 
02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
or helping the people are trying to kill
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
these programs but uh it's nothing it's
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a very short thing a week
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
and they also talk about Buddhism they
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
also talk about so any University today
 
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
I'm in you know I've taken a theology
 
02:08:56.830 --> 02:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
class at Rivier they they you know they
 
02:08:59.470 --> 02:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
some of them just focus on Christianity
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%
some of them broaden out and at the
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
Catholic school you can do that
 
02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:06.189 align:start position:0%
Catholic school you can do that
uh

02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's enraging and I don't want
 
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
to be negative but it's enraging to
 
02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
think that uh that somebody would try to
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
force us back into failed schools with
 
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
our children you only get one shot this
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
isn't like you're telling me that uh
 
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
you're not going to allow a supermarket
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
in my neighborhood I have to go to the
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
one I don't like cuz we can't get a new
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
one you're you're telling me that I have
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
to send my kids uh to uh to a bad school
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
and uh it seems like that this is like a
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
trojan horse for for teachers unions uh
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
support and not really an interest in in
 
02:09:41.709 --> 02:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
uh the welfare and education of the kids
 
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I think Mr fredman
 
02:09:45.390 --> 02:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
brought did it I don't have to repeat it
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know my kids are not Catholic um but
 
02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh they've excelled um I know parents um
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
at that school who have in some cases
 
02:09:55.470 --> 02:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
seven or eight kids and some of them
 
02:09:57.549 --> 02:09:57.559 align:start position:0%
half them go to public school and half
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
go to the to the Catholic school and uh
 
02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately where we live and where we
 
02:10:05.149 --> 02:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
are in
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
nsha uh and that won't maybe happen in
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
Hollis maybe not in Amis maybe not up
 
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
north maybe you guys got really really
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
good Public Schools you know my sister's
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
a good in a good public school this is
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
not about public school teachers I'm
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
supportive of public schools 100% so is
 
02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
my wife she was against saying the kids
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
cuz she's not Catholic um but uh when
 
02:10:24.669 --> 02:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
you're in a you're assigned to a bad a
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
really a failed public school that's
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
getting single digits on a scale of a
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
100 of proficiency which several uh
 
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
National schools are I know Manchester
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
does too I just follow some of the
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
stats you're not going to do that to
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
your children you're just not going to
 
02:10:42.669 --> 02:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
do it and uh I just it it upsets me I
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
understand that maybe some people just
 
02:10:46.750 --> 02:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
they hate the idea of of taxpayer money
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh being given back the taxpayers uh for
 
02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
for private schools but it just seems
 
02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
like at this point it's not even really
 
02:10:55.709 --> 02:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
about that it just seems like for some
 
02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
people it's just about trying to destroy
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
school choice and um them's fighting
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
words for me right now I got kids and I
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
spent did my time overseas I sacrificed
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
for 30 years over there it's enraging to
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%

02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
who were getting their degrees to be
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
teachers and I held that position for 3
 
02:13:47.069 --> 02:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
years until there was a 50% budget cut
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
for UNH and my position was one of many
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%

02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
private education having attended
 
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.840 align:start position:0%

last two
 
02:14:10.109 --> 02:14:10.119 align:start position:0%
years this bill HB 1084 seeks to
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
reestablish minimum qualifications for
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education and they
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
truly are minimum standards a degree
 
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
from an accredited college or university
 
02:14:23.229 --> 02:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
certification as an educator and 5 years
 
02:14:25.149 --> 02:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
experience as either a teacher or
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
administrator in a public school
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
system while I'm having trouble locating
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
the document um in the 1980s there was a
 
02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:35.559 align:start position:0%
set of standards for all of our
 
02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners including Commissioner of
 
02:14:39.149 --> 02:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
Education um but they were removed in a
 
02:14:41.229 --> 02:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
deregulation sweep during the Reagan Era
 
02:14:43.870 --> 02:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
and have not been Revisited since this
 
02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to create a bare minimum of
 
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
Standards Less in fact than most school
 
02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
systems would require to hire someone as
 
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
a principal let alone a
 
02:14:55.109 --> 02:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
superintendent yet the commissioner is
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
of education is fundamentally the
 
02:14:58.589 --> 02:14:58.599 align:start position:0%
superintendent of all public school
 
02:15:00.149 --> 02:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
systems in New
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um one document that I'm going
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
to share and I only printed one copy
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
because it's 40 something pages and I'll
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
hand that to your committee um gives
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
details of the requirements in States
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
across the country for this crucial
 
02:15:15.189 --> 02:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
position but I pulled out a few key
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
highlights in Alabama the superintendent
 
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
of Education she'll be a person of good
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
moral character with academic and
 
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
professional education equivalent to the
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
graduation from standard college or
 
02:15:28.510 --> 02:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
university who's knowledgeable in school
 
02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
administration and has a training and
 
02:15:32.910 --> 02:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
experience sufficient to qualify him I
 
02:15:34.589 --> 02:15:34.599 align:start position:0%
would add or her to perform the duties
 
02:15:38.669 --> 02:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
of office in Alaska the commissioner
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
shall have um at least a master's degree
 
02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
with five years experience in the field
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
of education and at least three of the
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
five years in an exclusively
 
02:15:48.430 --> 02:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
administrative position
 
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
in Arkansas the commissioner should have
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
a master's degree from an accredited
 
02:15:54.510 --> 02:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
institution 10 years experience as a
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
teacher five of which have to be in an
 
02:15:59.709 --> 02:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
administrative or supervisory nature in
 
02:16:01.549 --> 02:16:01.559 align:start position:0%
Indiana they need to demonstrate
 
02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
personal and professional leadership
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
preferably in administration of public
 
02:16:07.549 --> 02:16:07.559 align:start position:0%
education they need an earned Advanced
 
02:16:09.310 --> 02:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
degree preferably in education or
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
educational Administration awarded from
 
02:16:13.229 --> 02:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
a regionally or nationally accredited
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
college or
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
university they also have to have a
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
license or have held a license as a
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
teacher superintendent or principal or

any combination of these for at least 5
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
years prior to taking the office and at

principal or executive in the field of
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
Education as I said I've got 41 pages I
 
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
could go on but I I don't think that's
 
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
necessary additionally I spoke to a
 
02:16:40.589 --> 02:16:40.599 align:start position:0%
number of people who do hiring for towns
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
for small businesses and for large
 
02:16:44.549 --> 02:16:44.559 align:start position:0%
corporations to see what they look for
 
02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
when hiring or appointing someone to a
 
02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
senior supervisory position
 
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
unequivocally they stated expertise in
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
the field preferably a directly related
 
02:16:55.150 --> 02:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
Advanced degree in the area being
 
02:16:57.389 --> 02:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
supervised a progression of jobs in the
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
industry showing they are prepared and
 
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
have the core skills and experience to
 
02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
fully understand all aspects of the
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
organization they are supervising as
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
well as a demonstrated interest in
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
supporting that
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
organization in case all of this is
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
difficult to understand in theoretical
 
02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
mode here's an example that might be
 
02:17:18.509 --> 02:17:18.519 align:start position:0%
more clear imagine you have a badly
 
02:17:20.349 --> 02:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
broken leg with multiple fractures and
 
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
Bone protruding from your
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
skin you wouldn't want me to be your
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
surgeon even though I've spent hours
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
binge watching ER Grace's anatomy and
 
02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
mash I mean I did pass biology in high
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
school and topics in contemporary
 
02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
chemistry in college and I attended the
 
02:17:36.429 --> 02:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
emergency incident training at lunch
 
02:17:38.669 --> 02:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
here in the state house last spring but
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
none of that makes me qualified to
 
02:17:42.750 --> 02:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
perform the procedure nor to supervise
 
02:17:44.349 --> 02:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
the Doctor Who
 
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
should I began my testimony by saying
 
02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
I'd attended both public and private
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
school when I was younger and that I
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
taught both public and private school
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
it's one reason why this bill specifies
 
02:17:56.830 --> 02:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
experience working in a public school
 
02:17:59.790 --> 02:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
system by law and also by good moral
 
02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
standards Public Schools cannot
 
02:18:04.270 --> 02:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
discriminate about who attends them they
 
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
cannot block a child who might be slower
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
to develop or is learning disabilities
 
02:18:10.589 --> 02:18:10.599 align:start position:0%
or even those with severe behavioral
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
challenges from attending believe me I
 
02:18:15.389 --> 02:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
know I taught those
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
kids there are requirements to provide
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
all sorts of services from public
 
02:18:22.349 --> 02:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
schools and report to any student and
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
Reporting requirements for any student
 
02:18:26.429 --> 02:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
who wants to enroll so the person who
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
heads up the organization that is
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
supposed to ensure that all of our kids
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
are getting a quality education should
 
02:18:33.870 --> 02:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
be familiar with how public schools
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
actually work what some of the Dynamics
 
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
and challenges are and what makes them a
 
02:18:40.030 --> 02:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
truly unique and wonderful example of
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
how to create a more perfect
 
02:18:44.589 --> 02:18:44.599 align:start position:0%
union the success and strength of public
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
school should be reflected in its
 
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
leaders there currently isn't that
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
visibility in supporting teaching and
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
learning in the public school setting
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
nor is there an understanding empathy
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
and support for the difficult scenarios
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
and situations School administrators and
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
teachers face every day um that must
 
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
face every day to keep our kids safe fed
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
and educated um I hope you will support
 
02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and will demonstrate a
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
commitment to meeting the needs of
 
02:19:08.910 --> 02:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
students across New Hampshire
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
additionally um I'm going to be passing
 
02:19:13.469 --> 02:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
out uh written testimony from uh
 
02:19:15.150 --> 02:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative Nick dmana who's also a
 
02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
professor at Keen um ke
 
02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
State ke anyway Keen um he's teaching
 
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
this morning but I have his written
 
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and I want to highlight from
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
your online testimony the New Hampshire
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
Association of school principal
 
02:19:30.509 --> 02:19:30.519 align:start position:0%
submitted their written testimony um in
 
02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
support of this bill focusing on the
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
fact that the role requires a deep
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of the complexities of the
 
02:19:38.349 --> 02:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
education system as well as the ability
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
to navigate the everchanging landscape
 
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
of educational legislation and funding
 
02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
um they go on later to say that the role
 
02:19:47.469 --> 02:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
of Commissioner of education at the
 
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
state level in the United States is a
 
02:19:50.830 --> 02:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
highly demanding position that requires
 
02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
a combination of educational expertise
 
02:19:54.670 --> 02:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
leadership experience and effective
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
communication skills they have much more
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
in their letter I'm just highlighting a
 
02:20:00.910 --> 02:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
couple parts and in the online testimony
 
02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
submissions there are currently 209
 
02:20:05.309 --> 02:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
people who've submitted in support 20
 
02:20:07.309 --> 02:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
who opposed and just one that's
 
02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
neutral thank you very much are there
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:12.870 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
represent

02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:20:15.389 --> 02:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
leus you were talking about the broken
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
leg and I'm wondering
 
02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
if you had a choice between a doctor who
 
02:20:23.710 --> 02:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
had worked at a private institution that
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
specializes in broken legs or a general
 
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
doctor who worked at a public
 
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
institution but that you know that
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
institution is not done well um which
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
would you want to go to I'd want the
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who was qualified to do the
 
02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
surgery and so does where they got their
 
02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:48.590 align:start position:0%
surgery and so does where they got their
experience

02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
matter I I would say that what makes
 
02:20:52.429 --> 02:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
someone qualified definitely has to do
 
02:20:54.429 --> 02:20:54.439 align:start position:0%
with their experience yes and I don't
 
02:20:55.950 --> 02:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
believe that someone who has never had
 
02:20:57.389 --> 02:20:57.399 align:start position:0%
any experience working in a public
 
02:20:59.230 --> 02:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
school system truly understands the
 
02:21:02.190 --> 02:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of how they work thank you uh
 
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
repr sen cascaden and representative
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have um explored the
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
RSA 21 um in preparing this but I just
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
want to point out a couple things and
 
02:21:19.309 --> 02:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
then get your response to that so an RSA
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
21 N3 is about the commissioner and
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
Deputy uh commissioner uh positions and
 
02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
one of the criteria is the commissioner
 
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
and Deputy
 
02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
Commissioner um shall be qualified to
 
02:21:35.710 --> 02:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
hold their positions by reason of
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
education and
 
02:21:40.990 --> 02:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
experience and RSA 21
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
and-4 the duties of a commissioner
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
specify that they are are to be
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
representing the public interest in the
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
administration of the function of the
 
02:21:53.309 --> 02:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed and does this bill
 
02:21:55.550 --> 02:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
change anything in that RSA in
 
02:21:58.190 --> 02:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
particular or are we just not following
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
this RSA my belief is this would
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
strengthen that RSA by making it more
 
02:22:04.510 --> 02:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
specific that they would also have to
 
02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
have experience within a public school
 
02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
system so that they understand the
 
02:22:10.510 --> 02:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of public schools thank you
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%

back to uh 21 and4 the duties of

back to uh 21 and4 the duties of
commissioner

02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:22:20.309 --> 02:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm having trouble finding anything
 
02:22:23.389 --> 02:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
in there in terms of the duties of a
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner that would require them to
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
have been a certified teacher or
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
administrator could you point me to any
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the duties that
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
would representative cascaden just
 
02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:36.910 align:start position:0%
would representative cascaden just
referen

02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
referen
 
02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:38.990 align:start position:0%
referen
them

02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
I General experience and responsibility
 
02:22:45.150 --> 02:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
requires you to have been a certified
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't have further further questions
 
02:22:57.309 --> 02:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent belshire
 
02:22:58.590 --> 02:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:23:01.870 --> 02:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you you suggested
 
02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
that the these particular um
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
qualifications are comparable to what is
 
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
required for a school principal no I
 
02:23:10.190 --> 02:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
said that they were less than what would
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
be required for a school principle but
 
02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
they I was as the bill States these
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
would be absolute minimum standards not
 
02:23:18.429 --> 02:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
maximum ideally it would be someone with
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
an advanced degree with many years
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
experience I know my school district
 
02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
recently hired a new superintendent and
 
02:23:27.269 --> 02:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
they chose to take hire the person with
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
20 years of experience versus the person
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
who had thank you for that correction if
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
I may continue my question um if this is
 
02:23:36.110 --> 02:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
the minimum set of or less than the
 
02:23:39.269 --> 02:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
minimum that is generally required for
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh principles yet we know that all over
 
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
the state we have schools that are
 
02:23:46.349 --> 02:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
struggling including some that are
 
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
outright fake failing then these do not
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
obviously confer some sort of magical
 
02:23:53.710 --> 02:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
ability to a principal to manage a
 
02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
school why would this result in in a
 
02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
good uh
 
02:24:00.429 --> 02:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh I'm not saying that this
 
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
would be the maximum standards very
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
specifically it it's the minimum
 
02:24:06.349 --> 02:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
standards that we would want someone
 
02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
with at the very least a basic
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of how Public Schools work
 
02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
someone who has worked within a public
 
02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
school system and seen the varying
 
02:24:14.190 --> 02:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
Dynamics and the changes that happen
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
within a public school system which are
 
02:24:18.590 --> 02:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
unique to public schools and are not and
 
02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
don't occur in private schools in
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
charter schools in um homeschooling
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
environments or for people who have no
 
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
experience at all in education um the
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of a business for example like
 
02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
the person who runs my Supermarket um
 
02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
they're outstanding at identifying the
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
needs of the
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
supermarket but I wouldn't want them to
 
02:24:39.269 --> 02:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
do my leg surgery and I also don't
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
believe they're qualified to run my
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
school they are very good at the product
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
they provide um just as a factory owner
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
would ideally know the best way to to
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
run their Factory our schools are not
 
02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
factories our schools are sources of
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
education and support for all
 
02:24:56.910 --> 02:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
students F the questions if I may just
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you because that helped clarify
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
what what we're looking at I think in
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
terms of this so if I'm if I understand
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
correctly the the point of implementing
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
these minimum standards is because that
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
would allow for a person who's filling
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
this position to understand how the
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
current system operates such that they
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
can continue to reproduce the current
 
02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
system no it might allow them to make
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
amazing changes to the system maybe what
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
they recognize is the way in which the
 
02:25:25.870 --> 02:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
system doesn't work right now and needs
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be improved or maybe they recognize
 
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
that this school district is doing
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
things well and this one isn't and that
 
02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's ways of partnering those school
 
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
districts to improve both thank you
 
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you chairman L
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
um good morning again good morning I'm
 
02:25:44.269 --> 02:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
looking at uh just something very misu
 
02:25:46.469 --> 02:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
really but on line 12 of your proposed
 
02:25:46.479 --> 02:25:47.510 align:start position:0%
really but on line 12 of your proposed
bill

02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm not suggesting I have anything
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
against your upper your upper
 
02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions on 8 n tanks I agree with
 
02:25:56.110 --> 02:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
those um however on line 12 if this bill
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
became effective July 1
 
02:26:03.230 --> 02:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
2024 what would happen to the current
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
incumbent of that position U who has
 
02:26:09.550 --> 02:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
three years left on their contract so I
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
asked OLS if we could have it state that
 
02:26:14.190 --> 02:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
date or at the conclusion of the current
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner's term and they said we had
 
02:26:20.070 --> 02:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
to pick a specific date so I I don't
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
actually have the answer to your
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
question um I just know that ol said we
 
02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it in or as a an effective
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
date and we had to pick a day okay thank
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you CH L further questions
 
02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:32.950 align:start position:0%
you thank you CH L further questions
represent

02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:26:36.030 --> 02:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you Mr chair and just uh
 
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
followup to give a little bit more
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
clarity so again RSA 21 does specify
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
qualified to hold their positions by
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
reason of education and experience to me
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's not just any experience it's
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
particular to the
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
field but would your town hire a fire
 
02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
chief and a police chief who has not
 
02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
been a firefighter or a police officer
 
02:26:58.830 --> 02:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
just curious uh I mean I can't speak to
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
other people's towns I only know the way
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
my town works and absolutely not they
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
would never hire someone who wasn't
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
qualified to do the job represent
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair am I correct
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
in saying that this bill would put more
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
qualifications into statute for the
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education than compared
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
to commissioners of other departments
 
02:27:20.269 --> 02:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
say Transportation agricultural natural
 
02:27:23.269 --> 02:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources to name a few are
 
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
do those Commissioners also have
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
comparable qualifications written out in
 
02:27:33.389 --> 02:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
statute um so this bill specifically is
 
02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue um in uh next year
 
02:27:39.309 --> 02:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
we can bring forward legislation to make
 
02:27:40.510 --> 02:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
sure that all of our commissioners
 
02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
across boards are qualified in their
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
specific areas I I didn't um as a first
 
02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
term legislator think it was appropriate
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
for me to submit 20 separate bills this
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
year I felt that I would focus on one at
 
02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
a time and make sure that I was doing it
 
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
effectively may I have a followup yes
 
02:27:59.950 --> 02:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
you may so you would see this bill as a
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
start of further
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
regulations for government officials is
 
02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
this the start of more future bills no I
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
see this bill as one to make sure that
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
we have a commissioner of Education who
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
is actually qualified to be the
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay further questions thank you very
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:30.190 --> 02:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
vote thank you Mr chairman good morning

of the best are educating our students
 
02:30:21.469 --> 02:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
the fact that our Commissioner of

education and Deputy Commissioner of

have experience in a classroom or have
 
02:30:32.269 --> 02:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
not even been through the same processes
 
02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
that so many Educators and
 
02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
administrators are required to by New
 
02:30:37.630 --> 02:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%

I have years of experience in Business
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%

towards a state certification in
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
teaching or even in the process of my
 
02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
cags should that qualify me to lead the
 
02:30:56.590 --> 02:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
charge for New Hampshire's education
 
02:30:59.910 --> 02:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
system in any other job application the
 
02:31:01.309 --> 02:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
hiring manager for the position would
 
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
look at that resume and say we're going
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
to pass they have no relevant experience
 
02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
we hold the same standards for any other
 
02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
job in this world currently that
 
02:31:11.550 --> 02:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
relevant experience and specific
 
02:31:13.870 --> 02:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications are necessary to be even
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
considered for the role it's about time
 
02:31:17.469 --> 02:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
that commissioner and Deputy
 
02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education are held to
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
that standard as well for the position
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
you must have experience working or
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
being an administrator in one of our
 
02:31:26.910 --> 02:31:26.920 align:start position:0%

fredman Bridgewater private citizen
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
again I'm going to oppose this bill and
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
similar to the last bill this bill is
 
02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
all about eliminating flexibility and
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
options the thing is the government
 
02:32:13.710 --> 02:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
schools if you hire people only that
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
come that worked and you know got to
 
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
have the 5 years more experience you're
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
getting people from the inside people
 
02:32:22.110 --> 02:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
from the inside are not going to change
 
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
the system I'm not saying they're not
 
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
qualified and they just have it's a
 
02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
world view of youve come from that
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
system it's good and it's got to stay a
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
certain way and and maybe we can tweak
 
02:32:35.830 --> 02:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
it a little bit they're not going to
 
02:32:38.269 --> 02:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
make major changes you need people from
 
02:32:40.990 --> 02:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
the outside and that's why it doesn't
 
02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
mean you can't have people from the
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
inside but having more options uh I
 
02:32:49.030 --> 02:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
think is better for everyone and you get
 
02:32:53.830 --> 02:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
a fresher view fresh blood um also B uh
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
schools are a business and a lot of
 
02:32:59.150 --> 02:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
people say education is it's different
 
02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's the kids Minds no it's not
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
different it's a business the business
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
should be teaching academic skills that
 
02:33:09.070 --> 02:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
is a business and I'm sorry to say the
 
02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
government schools are not doing a great
 
02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
job they're trying to do too much right
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
now they're not focused let's get back
 
02:33:17.269 --> 02:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
to it is a business business of
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
educating academics the basic stuff and
 
02:33:23.309 --> 02:33:23.319 align:start position:0%
I think having the options of getting
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
people with experience and uh from the
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
outside running businesses that can
 
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
actually accomplish the goal at hand is
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to have that flexibility and
 
02:33:37.469 --> 02:33:37.479 align:start position:0%
I think limiting limiting it to people
 
02:33:40.030 --> 02:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
basically from the inside the system is
 
02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
doomed to failure and that's why I
 
02:33:44.269 --> 02:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
oppose this Bill thank you very much are
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
you willing to take questions yes
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
02:33:50.110 --> 02:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman L good
 
02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for coming back again
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
um if you wanted to uh create a new
 
02:34:00.750 --> 02:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
system would you feel more comfortable
 
02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
bringing someone who is focused on
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
creating new systems in a specific field
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
or someone who just creates new systems
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
well I don't think we can bring in a a
 
02:34:15.469 --> 02:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
new system at this point so I'd say
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
improving okay that the question yeah
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
May the question to be clear if you were
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
creating a new system would you prefer
 
02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
to have someone who has experience in
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
the system and recreating it or someone
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
who has no experience to recrea a
 
02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
system I want all yeah I just want all
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
the options open I I don't want limiting
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
options thank you thank you further
 
02:34:42.269 --> 02:34:42.279 align:start position:0%

Belmont Earl I live in barington with my
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
husband and our two School AG children I
 
02:35:10.910 --> 02:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
support HB 1084 because both of my
 
02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
children are autistic and receive the
 
02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
legal right to an appropriate education
 
02:35:17.269 --> 02:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
in public
 
02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
school currently our Commissioner of
 
02:35:21.790 --> 02:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
education does not need to have any
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
background in public education this can
 
02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
result in blind spots including the
 
02:35:29.389 --> 02:35:29.399 align:start position:0%
right of children with disabilities to
 
02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:32.200 align:start position:0%

background in public education is more
 
02:35:49.630 --> 02:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
likely to understand the complexity and

the current educational system in

non-verbal and has sensory challenges
 
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
could somehow be pushed out of a public
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
school and lose
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
fape he is in an integrated preschool
 
02:36:12.790 --> 02:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
program where Educators help him make
 
02:36:15.630 --> 02:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
friends with both typical children and
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
children who experience disability he is
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
learning to recognize the letters in his
 
02:36:24.110 --> 02:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
name and to spell along with his abled
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
classmates if he were to attend a
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
private school specifically for autistic
 
02:36:32.670 --> 02:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
children there is no law guaranteeing
 
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
that he would receive the appropriate
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
education that his other typical
 
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
classmates would
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
receive he also definitely would not be

only someone with a working knowledge of
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
our system could Navigate please pass HB
 
02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:06.600 align:start position:0%

older they're more likely to be
um

02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:46.520 align:start position:0%

in in in view of some of the other
 
02:38:23.790 --> 02:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
comments we've we've we've heard this
 
02:38:26.910 --> 02:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
morning that if we had a commissioner of

Education that actually had a background
 
02:38:34.030 --> 02:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
in in education and in public schools um
 
02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
that if we had a commissioner with that
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
sort of background that they would be
 
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
able to receive advice from their um
 
02:38:45.150 --> 02:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
their state board of you know the State

technical Educators or professionally
 
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
engaged in that work that they would
 
02:39:00.910 --> 02:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner being a skilled
 
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
educator credential educator would be
 
02:39:06.429 --> 02:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
able to receive advice from people who
 
02:39:08.910 --> 02:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
were not professional Educators and that
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
that would serve the public interest in
 
02:39:14.750 --> 02:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
terms of having working knowledge of the
 
02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%

Hampshire and I'm a single M of two boys
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
my oldest boy is 8 years old and on the
 
02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
artist Spectrum I support HP 1084
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
because public education is complic get
 
02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
it and require someone at the helm with
 
02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
more than just a basic understanding of
 
02:40:25.309 --> 02:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
how how it operates I graduated with a
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
bachelor degrees in business finance 13
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
years ago but I struggled advocating for
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
my son I initially trusted the education
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
system after two years in school my uh I
 
02:40:40.269 --> 02:40:40.279 align:start position:0%
noticed that there had been no growth in
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
my my son functional Behavioral or
 
02:40:46.190 --> 02:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
academic abilities he used to enjoy
 
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
singing from the age of 1 to three and
 
02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
used to pronounce a few words but
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
instead of developing them at school he
 
02:40:56.349 --> 02:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
regrets he lost his speech while
 
02:40:58.830 --> 02:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
undergoing speech therapy and obtaining
 
02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
all proper assistance even something as
 
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
easy as an AAC device a common support
 
02:41:08.429 --> 02:41:08.439 align:start position:0%
for communication was denied to my son
 
02:41:11.550 --> 02:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
in first grade I realized I had to start
 
02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
taking matters into my own hands
 
02:41:15.910 --> 02:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
particularly when I started receiving
 
02:41:17.790 --> 02:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
calls to pick up my son from school
 
02:41:20.950 --> 02:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
because he was having l ly Tantrums or
 
02:41:23.230 --> 02:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
meltdowns behavior that are common when
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
children do not have access to
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
communication tools his teacher were
 
02:41:30.309 --> 02:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
AOSS on how to handle it as an educated
 
02:41:32.269 --> 02:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
woman I had to a knowledge I did not
 
02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
know enough to fully advocate for my son
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
I delve more into learning about my
 
02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
son's condition the educational system
 
02:41:41.990 --> 02:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
and disability the more I learn the more
 
02:41:44.030 --> 02:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
I recognize education is complicated
 
02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
based and I became and I began my master
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
degree in special education when I
 
02:41:50.429 --> 02:41:50.439 align:start position:0%
learned the commission of the New
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education was an
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
accounting professional without any
 
02:41:57.550 --> 02:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
special education experience I was
 
02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
perplexed to me it makes no sense for
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
someone lacking special education
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
training or any training in education to
 
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
make decision on behalf of New Hampshire
 
02:42:08.670 --> 02:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
children families and Educators my
 
02:42:10.510 --> 02:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
business degree will have served me well
 
02:42:12.750 --> 02:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
if education were a business fortunately
 
02:42:15.230 --> 02:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's not the commission of education has
 
02:42:17.389 --> 02:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
a complicated job within a complicated
 
02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
system special education is a Bas all on
 
02:42:23.389 --> 02:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
its own it is of the utmost importance
 
02:42:26.190 --> 02:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
to have an amendment in place requiring
 
02:42:28.269 --> 02:42:28.279 align:start position:0%
a background in special education
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
instruction New Hampshire is growing and
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
becoming more diverse this holds
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
significant importance for my family
 
02:42:37.230 --> 02:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
particularly those of us for whom
 
02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
English is a second language navigating
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
a foreign culture and learning the
 
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
language is difficult enough knowing how
 
02:42:46.349 --> 02:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
to advocate for a child with develop and
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
delay further complicated situation
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you very
 
02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:52.960 align:start position:0%

Mr chair thank you for being here I
 
02:43:00.429 --> 02:43:00.439 align:start position:0%
think your son is a very fortunate child
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
to have you as his mom with the effort
 
02:43:05.070 --> 02:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
that you have put into understanding
 
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
what his needs are and I'm wondering if
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
you would comment in your work to get I
 
02:43:12.510 --> 02:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
believe you said your Masters in special
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
education do you think there's a
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
parallel between the increase in your
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge and understanding of how to
 
02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
help and advocate for your son and what
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
a uh Commissioner of Education qualified
 
02:43:27.150 --> 02:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
in the way this bill proposes to be in
 
02:43:29.190 --> 02:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
the different knowledge level and
 
02:43:33.389 --> 02:43:33.399 align:start position:0%
philosophies that might occur from that
 
02:43:36.269 --> 02:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
difference yes um it made a lot of
 
02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
difference um especially when I because
 
02:43:41.309 --> 02:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
before when I was in those meeting I
 
02:43:45.070 --> 02:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to defend or his right
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
or or any more knowledge when because
 
02:43:50.710 --> 02:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
every time I would come to ask for a
 
02:43:52.269 --> 02:43:52.279 align:start position:0%
request for something I was put on the
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
wall like it it could not happen but
 
02:43:58.750 --> 02:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
since I've been furthering my knowledge
 
02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
and taking the special education I did
 
02:44:03.710 --> 02:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of stuff so he he
 
02:44:07.030 --> 02:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
permit me to better advocate for him
 
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
during the meetings and and I see a
 
02:44:15.389 --> 02:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
change since I I um I studed better uh
 
02:44:18.110 --> 02:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
advocating he started receiving Services
 
02:44:20.110 --> 02:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
because I had more knowledge and better
 
02:44:24.349 --> 02:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
to defend the request that was coming
 
02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
after further questions from the
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for coming
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
today thank you I'd like to have
 
02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
sers thank you Mr chair thank the
 
02:44:43.309 --> 02:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing my testimony uh on
 
02:44:47.190 --> 02:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
HB 1084 I look at it as my one of my
 
02:44:48.510 --> 02:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
constituents Aubrey Freeman just
 
02:44:51.389 --> 02:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned to you it's a business and as
 
02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
any of us going into business we know a
 
02:44:55.870 --> 02:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
lot about a business or we have a hot
 
02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
for it but it doesn't mean we know all
 
02:45:00.510 --> 02:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
aspects of it and what we do is we surpr
 
02:45:02.349 --> 02:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
we actually surround ourselves with
 
02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
experts that's what we do and that's
 
02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
what the I think any commissioner would
 
02:45:08.670 --> 02:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
do at this point or Deputy Commissioner
 
02:45:10.429 --> 02:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
they would hire the right people around
 
02:45:13.389 --> 02:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
them or as advisors to make sure they're
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
doing the best job they can so I look at
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
this is that opposing this bill gives
 
02:45:23.309 --> 02:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
more freedom and allows more freedom uh
 
02:45:25.030 --> 02:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
to the person that's going to be in that
 
02:45:27.630 --> 02:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
position and again if you're saying that
 
02:45:29.710 --> 02:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
someone has to have a college
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
education that doesn't make sense
 
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
because we just talked in previous bills
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
about uh social emotional learning that
 
02:45:39.389 --> 02:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
is taking over and what's causing that
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
is uh Caple saying hey if they're more
 
02:45:43.710 --> 02:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
socially and emotional they're going to
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
actually learn on their own by going out
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
to the internet and actually learn and
 
02:45:50.990 --> 02:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
develop their skills on academics so if
 
02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
they go out and do that they may not end
 
02:45:54.349 --> 02:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
up going to college but they're going to
 
02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
go on the internet and learn all they
 
02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
can on a certain subject so therefore
 
02:46:01.349 --> 02:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
you'll be you'll be um taking people
 
02:46:03.469 --> 02:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
that might be qualified because there
 
02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
are a lot of really smart people out
 
02:46:08.030 --> 02:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
there that just haven't gone to college
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
and I just that one reason alone is I'm
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
saying you'd be discarding a bunch of
 
02:46:15.230 --> 02:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
people that actually could be good for
 
02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
the position and the position is not
 
02:46:19.070 --> 02:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
just given anybody I'm sure they're
 
02:46:21.389 --> 02:46:21.399 align:start position:0%
going through an interview as well so
 
02:46:23.070 --> 02:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
again I'm opposing this bill un that's
 
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
the reasons why thank you very much are
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
there any
 
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you uh
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:44.950 --> 02:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
Horgan um thank you I'm represent Tim
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%

the town of Durham so I U I support this
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill I thank the prime sponsor who's
 
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
also from my district for bringing
 
02:46:55.550 --> 02:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
forward and uh for my neighbor former
 
02:46:57.710 --> 02:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
represent voted for coming to speak in
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
behalf of it so I think this is a you
 
02:47:03.550 --> 02:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
know fairly Common Sense Common Sense
 
02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:04.910 align:start position:0%
know fairly Common Sense Common Sense
bill

02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
um and of course there's the uh and you
 
02:47:08.399 --> 02:47:09.469 align:start position:0%
um and of course there's the uh and you
if

02:47:09.469 --> 02:47:09.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
you I mean you are certainly free to
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
amend it too if you if you object
 
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
somebody the fact that the person's has
 
02:47:16.750 --> 02:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
to have five years of experience in a
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
public school which of course is a
 
02:47:20.790 --> 02:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
pretty minimal amount for a commissioner
 
02:47:24.150 --> 02:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
of of any Department you know you can uh
 
02:47:25.550 --> 02:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
get your Advanced degree and be
 
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
certified and um get five years combined
 
02:47:30.269 --> 02:47:30.279 align:start position:0%
experience before you're 30 years old
 
02:47:32.110 --> 02:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
and all the Commissioners are uh you
 
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
know much older than that not that
 
02:47:36.309 --> 02:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
people under 30 aren't aren't very
 
02:47:38.830 --> 02:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
skillful too so I think as a practical
 
02:47:41.269 --> 02:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
matter uh I think that those are all
 
02:47:43.230 --> 02:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
very reasonable requirements we've heard
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
it said that the Public School System
 
02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is failing um it's far
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
from perfect but the idea that it's
 
02:47:52.830 --> 02:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
totally failing is uh I think uh I think
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
fallacious I can understand if you
 
02:47:56.950 --> 02:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
choose to send your kids to private
 
02:47:59.190 --> 02:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
school which is a very legitimate Choice
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh you may uh you may have sort of
 
02:48:05.429 --> 02:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
you're emoly attached to whatever School
 
02:48:07.469 --> 02:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
you send your kids to so far that may be
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know sort of a prival saying the
 
02:48:11.710 --> 02:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
private schools are terrible but they're
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
um they're not perfect but most of them
 
02:48:15.750 --> 02:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
are most of them are pretty good if you
 
02:48:17.830 --> 02:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
go to a private school if you go to a
 
02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
any public school here you'll see uh
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
very adorable kids doing very wonderful
 
02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
things um just like you do when you go
 
02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
to a charter school which is sort of a
 
02:48:28.510 --> 02:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
hyper between a public and private
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
school or you know a private school and
 
02:48:32.550 --> 02:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
also by the other same token not all the
 
02:48:34.510 --> 02:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
private schools in Hampshire are perfect
 
02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:35.750 align:start position:0%
private schools in Hampshire are perfect
like

02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:48:39.150 --> 02:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
um like I I know of someone who sent a
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh their some of their children to a
 
02:48:42.870 --> 02:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
public school some of them to a private
 
02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
school that was actually listen on the
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
EFA vend list um not near the top
 
02:48:51.070 --> 02:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
farther farther down um she I think she
 
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
felt that the uh Public School actually
 
02:48:54.670 --> 02:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
provided a better foundation for those
 
02:48:56.910 --> 02:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
kids and the ones who Oran can you speak
 
02:48:59.550 --> 02:48:59.560 align:start position:0%
to the bill please I'm specifically to
 
02:49:01.550 --> 02:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
the changes in this bill oh I think it's
 
02:49:02.910 --> 02:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
a I think it's a very reasonable thing
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
to expect a person to have experience in
 
02:49:06.429 --> 02:49:06.439 align:start position:0%
the public school system that is the
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
major part of the Doe's uh Mission
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
although it does also oversee other
 
02:49:14.269 --> 02:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
forms of education and um even if we
 
02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
assume for the sake of argument that's
 
02:49:17.269 --> 02:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
corrected the public school system is a
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
total failure you should at least want
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
somebody who uh who knows why it failed
 
02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
which I and I don't agree that it's a
 
02:49:28.670 --> 02:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
total failure and also I think um you
 
02:49:30.750 --> 02:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
know the and people criticize the
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
incumbent the incumbent was a very smart
 
02:49:35.790 --> 02:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
guy he he was asked to take the job and
 
02:49:36.990 --> 02:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
he got it and I think he's doing the
 
02:49:38.670 --> 02:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
best he can but he was not I think that
 
02:49:40.910 --> 02:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
was not necessarily the best decision
 
02:49:43.750 --> 02:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
that was uh that was made by the current
 
02:49:45.870 --> 02:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
governor but um this isn't about him
 
02:49:48.910 --> 02:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
it's about what goes on forward and also
 
02:49:51.309 --> 02:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
I think somewhat I think somewhat if we
 
02:49:53.870 --> 02:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
have somebody who's really just very
 
02:49:55.309 --> 02:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
invested and somehow the idea of the
 
02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
public school system has failed that's
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a good thing to have
 
02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
them in charge it would be like say if
 
02:50:02.830 --> 02:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
we had somebody's convince that our
 
02:50:04.510 --> 02:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
highways are total failures that they're
 
02:50:06.429 --> 02:50:06.439 align:start position:0%
falling down and in fact they're in good
 
02:50:08.110 --> 02:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
condition I I drove up the entire link
 
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
to the Edward ever at Turnpike you know
 
02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
so if we had somebody who like wanted to
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
privatize the turnpike system as their
 
02:50:16.389 --> 02:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
cause we wouldn't want them necessarily
 
02:50:21.469 --> 02:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
being charged of the do if in fact um as
 
02:50:23.469 --> 02:50:23.479 align:start position:0%
as anybody drives our turnpik the
 
02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
turnpikes are not falling down they're
 
02:50:26.670 --> 02:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
in good condition and um I think the
 
02:50:29.469 --> 02:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
same is true the the CH education should
 
02:50:30.670 --> 02:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
be somebody who has at least a certain
 
02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
amount of confident understands that
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's both good things and bad things
 
02:50:36.030 --> 02:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
going on in the public schools so that's
 
02:50:38.150 --> 02:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's a very I think it's a
 
02:50:41.389 --> 02:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
very reasonable uh it's these are very
 
02:50:43.469 --> 02:50:43.479 align:start position:0%
uh these are very low expectations for
 
02:50:45.630 --> 02:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Education I'm sure
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
any future Governor will have no problem
 
02:50:50.510 --> 02:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
finding uh many people with all sorts of
 
02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
different viewpoints who meet those
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
minimal requirements so I I urue to pass
 
02:50:56.110 --> 02:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
the Bill are there any questions for
 
02:50:59.309 --> 02:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
represent Horgan sure represent Bel
 
02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:51:02.190 --> 02:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
taking this question you you made a
 
02:51:04.429 --> 02:51:04.439 align:start position:0%
comparison to the dot and we wouldn't
 
02:51:07.389 --> 02:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
want a do commissioner who wanted to
 
02:51:10.510 --> 02:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
privatize the roads but given given what
 
02:51:12.190 --> 02:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in this bill are you
 
02:51:14.830 --> 02:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the that part of the uh
 
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
rationale for doing this or that the
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
effect of doing this is to Institute a
 
02:51:22.229 --> 02:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
permanent sort of political preference
 
02:51:24.750 --> 02:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
among this job to continue a certain
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
policy um well no I was that wasn't my
 
02:51:30.269 --> 02:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
point although I guess my point although
 
02:51:31.950 --> 02:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
I guess I do believe that the policy
 
02:51:33.870 --> 02:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
that the private public schools are a
 
02:51:36.309 --> 02:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
total failure in the entire education
 
02:51:37.950 --> 02:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
system should be privatized I think
 
02:51:40.830 --> 02:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's simply not a correct
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
view and it's not practical to uh to
 
02:51:46.870 --> 02:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
implement so that but but um that's I
 
02:51:48.670 --> 02:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
may be making maybe exaggerating
 
02:51:50.429 --> 02:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
somewhat even what the uh current
 
02:51:52.269 --> 02:51:52.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner believes but certainly um I
 
02:51:53.830 --> 02:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
think the idea
 
02:51:56.910 --> 02:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
that the idea that we shouldn't have the
 
02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
idea that certainly I think I think it's
 
02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable to expect the Department of
 
02:52:02.229 --> 02:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
Education to be headed by somebody who's
 
02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
at least spent a few years uh teaching
 
02:52:06.750 --> 02:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
in the public schools like um you know I
 
02:52:08.590 --> 02:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks further questions from
 
02:52:10.630 --> 02:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
the committee not see any thank you very
 
02:52:13.469 --> 02:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
much and we will close this hearing
 
02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
we'll start the next hearing at 12:30 in
 
02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:43.429 align:start position:0%
we'll start the next hearing at 12:30 in
this

02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:43.439 --> 03:35:31.429 align:start position:0%
 
room

03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
well good morning afternoon to everybody
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
and welcome to the education committee
 
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
um obviously this bill has attracted a
 
03:35:42.110 --> 03:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
lot of folks folks we have folks in this
 
03:35:44.269 --> 03:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
room and three other rooms where it's
 
03:35:47.710 --> 03:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
all being streamed so I hope everybody
 
03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
can hear me throughout the four rooms
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
including this one uh 1610 is relative
 
03:35:55.790 --> 03:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
to standardized assessment data for
 
03:35:57.830 --> 03:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
participants in education Freedom
 
03:36:00.269 --> 03:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
accounts and we'll start it off here in
 
03:36:02.429 --> 03:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
a few moments but I want to lay out some
 
03:36:04.429 --> 03:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
of the ground rules and how we're going
 
03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
to function here
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
today um due to the nature the number of
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
people that request to speak we're going
 
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
to limit testimony to two minutes two
 
03:36:17.870 --> 03:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
minutes per person and we will then
 
03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
aside from the person that presents the
 
03:36:22.910 --> 03:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
presenter as policy and the education
 
03:36:25.070 --> 03:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee has the time needed to present
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
and discuss the bill with the committee
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
from that point forward including any
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives that come forward it's
 
03:36:35.229 --> 03:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
only two minutes uh per person so we try
 
03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
to be equal and fair to
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
everybody um if you have written test
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
testimony we ask that you not read it
 
03:36:45.910 --> 03:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
for btim try to give us the high points
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
on that testimony so and because we will
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
getting get all the written copies that
 
03:36:53.790 --> 03:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
are presented to us in fact what I'm
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
going to do is rather than you'll see us
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
passing paperwork around here that comes
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
in from people testifying we're going to
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
try and collect it at either end and we
 
03:37:05.950 --> 03:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
chrisc cross it and then hand it out to
 
03:37:08.070 --> 03:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
the committee following this Committee
 
03:37:10.830 --> 03:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
hearing from all the days that I was
 
03:37:12.630 --> 03:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
teacher principal administrator in
 
03:37:12.640 --> 03:37:13.630 align:start position:0%
teacher principal administrator in
school

03:37:13.630 --> 03:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:37:16.030 --> 03:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
districts it's better that we give our
 
03:37:18.070 --> 03:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
attention to the audience to the people
 
03:37:20.229 --> 03:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
testifying rather than sit here and read
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
while somebody else is trying to testify
 
03:37:24.309 --> 03:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that's polite it's
 
03:37:27.150 --> 03:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
basically rude so what we will do is we
 
03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
will stack all that information on
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
either end pass it out at the conclusion
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee to all the people in in
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
the room if something's already been
 
03:37:40.990 --> 03:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
been said by another person
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
you can give your story yes but don't
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
try to rehash the same thing over and
 
03:37:47.389 --> 03:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
over from the looks of it we have
 
03:37:49.110 --> 03:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
overflow to account account for about
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
250 folks if you multiply even just 200
 
03:37:56.670 --> 03:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
times 2 minutes per
 
03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
person and divide it by 60 minutes per
 
03:38:01.630 --> 03:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
hour you can see we're going to be here
 
03:38:03.229 --> 03:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
for over six
 
03:38:07.150 --> 03:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
hours so uh with that we we got to be
 
03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
respectful of each other and try to move
 
03:38:11.189 --> 03:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
on so with this I'd like to go right
 
03:38:14.269 --> 03:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
ahead into the hearing today and welcome
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%

city of

Berlin um and I'm here to present
 
03:38:32.710 --> 03:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
testimony on House Bill
 
03:38:36.510 --> 03:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
1610 um and I have to say uh I commend
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
all of those parents who choose whatever
 
03:38:42.110 --> 03:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
choice of education program they want um
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
I have willingly taught in private
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
schools and in public schools as well so
 
03:38:51.189 --> 03:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
teaching and learning is really my forte
 
03:38:55.349 --> 03:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
and I have a 45y year career in it um I
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
feel bad a little bit because every time
 
03:38:58.750 --> 03:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
something comes up with education
 
03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
Freedom account there is a
 
03:39:03.990 --> 03:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
defensive attitude that we are going to
 
03:39:06.590 --> 03:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
impact parent choice and I want to be
 
03:39:07.950 --> 03:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
clear that parents have always had
 
03:39:10.510 --> 03:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
choice for education and they should
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
continue to always have choice I don't
 
03:39:14.550 --> 03:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
think we should regulate A Parent's
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
Choice on how or where to educate their
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
kids so the attent of this bill is to
 
03:39:22.030 --> 03:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
collaborate in a bipartisan way with
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%

various sports program some learn music
 
03:41:08.990 --> 03:41:09.000 align:start position:0%

03:41:12.670 --> 03:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
the academic proficiency levels are
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
standardized tests have a critical role
 
03:41:15.600 --> 03:41:16.389 align:start position:0%
standardized tests have a critical role
in

03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:41:18.750 --> 03:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
education and I don't
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
Advocate that every single
 
03:41:24.630 --> 03:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
student is going to respond to a
 
03:41:27.550 --> 03:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
standardized test and there are always
 
03:41:30.149 --> 03:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the rule there has to be
 
03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about kids not things and
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
so they vary um while the national
 
03:41:39.269 --> 03:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
assessment of Education progress which
 
03:41:40.750 --> 03:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
is known as Nate
 
03:41:42.790 --> 03:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
has been used in this committee before
 
03:41:45.469 --> 03:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
is a reliable assessment it is based on
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
a representative sample of students and
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
schools must volunteer to participate
 
03:41:52.189 --> 03:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
and a test is administered every two
 
03:41:55.389 --> 03:41:55.399 align:start position:0%
years in grades 48 and 11 this
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
assessment cannot be used to measure
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
individual student growth or proficiency
 
03:41:59.399 --> 03:42:00.790 align:start position:0%
individual student growth or proficiency
over

03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:42:04.349 --> 03:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
time this bill 1610 does not change the
 
03:42:07.149 --> 03:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
EFA requirements it is simply a
 
03:42:09.389 --> 03:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill that directs the
 
03:42:12.309 --> 03:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to submit
 
03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
proficiency levels of students to the
 
03:42:17.070 --> 03:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed to post in a public
 
03:42:19.790 --> 03:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
data report platform like I
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
achieve I will have an amendment to add
 
03:42:25.030 --> 03:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
Clarity and to not impact any provisions
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the law for hom school students House
 
03:42:30.510 --> 03:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 610 will also satisfy one of the
 
03:42:33.030 --> 03:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
requirements from the education freeding
 
03:42:35.950 --> 03:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
savings account oversight committee who
 
03:42:38.189 --> 03:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
recently submitted a report public
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
report dated November 30th
 
03:42:43.590 --> 03:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
2023 um and the recommendation number
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
three was identify current and Future
 
03:42:48.790 --> 03:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
tools or metrics for student performance
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
and accountability including how the
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
school and educational setting
 
03:42:56.429 --> 03:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
demonstrate accountability so House Bill
 
03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
1610 is in the best interest of students
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
it provides transparency to the public
 
03:43:03.550 --> 03:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
and it provides accountability as
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
requested by the Legislative oversight
 
03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I have um circulated leave
 
03:43:12.830 --> 03:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
my extras on the table there just to
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
show you an
 
03:43:17.149 --> 03:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
example um of what the department of Ed
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
has and I have had conversation with
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn Davis about this um they're when
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
when they report their um achievement
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
scores of all the schools in the state
 
03:43:31.149 --> 03:43:31.159 align:start position:0%
there is a cover page that talks about
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
the number of students who have taken
 
03:43:35.750 --> 03:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
the assessment and you all know that
 
03:43:38.030 --> 03:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's an opt out um option and there
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
are also accommodations available but it
 
03:43:43.349 --> 03:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
just identifies that there was a total
 
03:43:43.359 --> 03:43:45.309 align:start position:0%
just identifies that there was a total
of

03:43:45.309 --> 03:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
167,50 students in New Hampshire who
 
03:43:49.870 --> 03:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
took the Statewide assessment and I'm
 
03:43:51.630 --> 03:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
not sitting here to say every student
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
should take the Statewide assessment
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
because it's not the only measure um so
 
03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
you can see the number of students
 
03:44:01.229 --> 03:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
across the state when you look at the
 
03:44:03.670 --> 03:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
backside is also a tab called
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
proficiency and growth and I wanted to
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to that because it's
 
03:44:10.630 --> 03:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
growth over time
 
03:44:12.189 --> 03:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
and that's what teaching and learning is
 
03:44:15.630 --> 03:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
planned from and you can look at in the
 
03:44:17.389 --> 03:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
most C current
 
03:44:20.149 --> 03:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
data what the pre-pandemic and the
 
03:44:23.469 --> 03:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
post-pandemic achievement is and
 
03:44:25.950 --> 03:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
certainly if you look at Ela grades 3 to
 
03:44:30.870 --> 03:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
8 and 11 you can see that prepandemic
 
03:44:33.510 --> 03:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic achievement levels have not
 
03:44:36.030 --> 03:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
been attained yet but if you look at the
 
03:44:38.469 --> 03:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
achievement data from the covid period
 
03:44:40.510 --> 03:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
of 2020
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
and 3 years beyond that you can see that
 
03:44:45.070 --> 03:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
there is steady growth at all grade
 
03:44:47.950 --> 03:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
levels um and it would seem to me that
 
03:44:51.070 --> 03:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
it would be pretty easy to be able to
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
just add either a page or a category
 
03:44:56.149 --> 03:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
that identifies x amount students
 
03:44:58.389 --> 03:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
receiving efas at a certain grade level
 
03:45:00.870 --> 03:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
or it maybe age level because we don't
 
03:45:03.389 --> 03:45:03.399 align:start position:0%
know what kind of learning platform and
 
03:45:05.870 --> 03:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
they may not all be following a
 
03:45:08.349 --> 03:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
traditional grade level but it's to make
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
sure that we know our kids learning how
 
03:45:13.550 --> 03:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
to read um and are they learning math
 
03:45:16.349 --> 03:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
facts and what's important in math um so
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the bill is about and
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's it did not
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
initially bring that forth um the bill
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
really had identified a different RSA
 
03:45:29.309 --> 03:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
but it really is specific to 194 which
 
03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
is the education freedum account
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
sections and that's it Mr chair thank
 
03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
you very much representative cascaden
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
committee yes representa leus
 
03:45:43.309 --> 03:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
I noticed that you haven't changed the
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
part that says unless each student is
 
03:45:48.070 --> 03:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
EXA all public school students in the
 
03:45:49.710 --> 03:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
designated grade shall participate in
 
03:45:52.349 --> 03:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
the assessment unless such student is
 
03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
Exempted from taking the test by his or
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
her parent and currently the EFA
 
03:46:03.229 --> 03:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
students have three ways of evaluating
 
03:46:05.149 --> 03:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
students and this would be one of the
 
03:46:08.910 --> 03:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
ways they would have right so by not
 
03:46:11.590 --> 03:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
choosing this way but by choosing a
 
03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
different way aren't they in
 
03:46:17.469 --> 03:46:17.479 align:start position:0%
effect exempting them from this I
 
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
mean do you what do you want a piece of
 
03:46:22.349 --> 03:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
paper from the parent that says I'm
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
exempting my kid and therefore I'm
 
03:46:26.269 --> 03:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
choosing this method instead of that
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
method because that's all that would
 
03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
happen I don't administer this program
 
03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
sorry is there a copy of the
 
03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
amendment you no um the Amendments have
 
03:46:40.110 --> 03:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
have been held pardon me no no I don't
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
have an amendment at this time okay
 
03:46:42.479 --> 03:46:43.510 align:start position:0%
have an amendment at this time okay
representa

03:46:43.510 --> 03:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
representa
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:46:47.469 --> 03:46:47.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um actually have
 
03:46:48.590 --> 03:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
two but they're linked but I'll ask for
 
03:46:52.429 --> 03:46:52.439 align:start position:0%
a followup in between um so let's say
 
03:46:54.910 --> 03:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
that I mean obviously that the point is
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
the of administering these standardized
 
03:46:58.510 --> 03:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
test I think is generally thought of as
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
as improving things over time but let's
 
03:47:05.189 --> 03:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
say we have administer these uh home
 
03:47:07.950 --> 03:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
these tests to homeschool students and
 
03:47:10.189 --> 03:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
we find some deficiencies
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
what are you proposing that the state
 
03:47:14.830 --> 03:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
does about that first of all I'm not
 
03:47:16.229 --> 03:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
concerned about the progress of a
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
homeschool student I'm concerned about
 
03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
the progress of students who are
 
03:47:23.229 --> 03:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:25.510 --> 03:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
dollars go ahead
 
03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
followup so same question except
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
recipients of EFA funds that are
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
homeschooling their
 
03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
children I'm not getting into the weeds
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
of who's homeschooling who's not I'm
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
very concerned about my tax
 
03:47:43.710 --> 03:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
dollars and where they go and and the
 
03:47:46.750 --> 03:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
it and if I if I may just one one follow
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
up on that uh
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
so regarding the very many government
 
03:47:56.269 --> 03:47:56.279 align:start position:0%
run or public schools that have
 
03:47:59.590 --> 03:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrated low test scores failing
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
level test scores in some cases on these
 
03:48:04.229 --> 03:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
standardized tests we've heard many
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
times in this committee from many
 
03:48:07.149 --> 03:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
members of this committee that the
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
schools are fine but the tests are not
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
properly measuring performance so are we
 
03:48:14.670 --> 03:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
now assuming based on what we're seeing
 
03:48:16.189 --> 03:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
in front of us that these tests are good
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
and they are properly measuring
 
03:48:19.990 --> 03:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
performance I can only speak to the
 
03:48:22.149 --> 03:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
public document on the department evet
 
03:48:24.030 --> 03:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
website I don't know about other
 
03:48:26.309 --> 03:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
standardized tests that are being used
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
because there's a number of them and
 
03:48:31.950 --> 03:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
certainly to be able to upload say a
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
common measure nobody needs to know
 
03:48:36.429 --> 03:48:36.439 align:start position:0%
whether somebody's taken one test or
 
03:48:38.670 --> 03:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
another but to to upload a common
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
measure to a certain group there is anal
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
an uh analytic software that would
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
convert that to one measure whether it's
 
03:48:48.990 --> 03:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
a percentile measure or any type of uh
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
range of proficiency
 
03:48:55.349 --> 03:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
level just for clarification purposes uh
 
03:48:58.550 --> 03:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
for everybody in the rooms we have
 
03:49:02.030 --> 03:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance laws in the state
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
and there's four categories within where
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
you can accomplish compulsory attendance
 
03:49:10.830 --> 03:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
or meet it one is you're in a public
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
school two you're in a private school
 
03:49:16.510 --> 03:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
three you're a homeschooler and fourth
 
03:49:19.389 --> 03:49:19.399 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts they are
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
separate items each one of them separate
 
03:49:24.750 --> 03:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
systems for meeting compulsory
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
attendance in this state so that's for
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
clarification purposes thank you further
 
03:49:31.870 --> 03:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent Kaden represent
 
03:49:35.229 --> 03:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
cordelli um thank you um uh I just
 
03:49:37.349 --> 03:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
wondering if you are aware um it's been
 
03:49:40.149 --> 03:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
brought up several times about um um
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
efas um being used uh using public
 
03:49:46.750 --> 03:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
dollars to purchase education options
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
but uh are you aware that Supreme Court
 
03:49:51.149 --> 03:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
on a number of occasions including
 
03:49:54.670 --> 03:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
zelman versus Simmon Harris had said
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
that once those public
 
03:49:59.309 --> 03:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
dollars are put into an account for the
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
parent they are exercising private
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
choice they are no longer um using
 
03:50:08.070 --> 03:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
public funds at that point are are you
 
03:50:09.870 --> 03:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
aware of that
 
03:50:13.790 --> 03:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not aware of it no and I'm
 
03:50:15.870 --> 03:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
looking out for what's best for
 
03:50:17.950 --> 03:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
kids further
 
03:50:20.229 --> 03:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
03:50:23.710 --> 03:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
much um no more further questions from
 
03:50:25.229 --> 03:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
the committee for
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
you um the way we handle these committee
 
03:50:32.790 --> 03:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh hearings is that we try to get the
 
03:50:34.950 --> 03:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
representatives are wanting to testify
 
03:50:37.429 --> 03:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
out of the room so they can get back to
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
a room where they're breaking away from
 
03:50:41.590 --> 03:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
where they need to be working there and
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
so I do have three cards from
 
03:50:45.149 --> 03:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
Representatives here I'm going to go
 
03:50:47.269 --> 03:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
through those three Representatives then
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
what I will be doing is starting to call
 
03:50:53.149 --> 03:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
as the stack comes up here the the folks
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%

Leon thank you Mr chairman and members
 
03:52:27.750 --> 03:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Erica lean I
 
03:52:29.550 --> 03:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
represent the town of dairy my first
 
03:52:31.189 --> 03:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
year of my first term I sat on this
 
03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
committee I was involved in the bill
 
03:52:34.830 --> 03:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
drafting the EFA program and I did the
 
03:52:36.149 --> 03:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
most recent update of the home school
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
laws um the original concern seems to be
 
03:52:41.189 --> 03:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be a record keeping
 
03:52:43.590 --> 03:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
for the EFA program anybody who takes a
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide takes a test reports it to the
 
03:52:48.229 --> 03:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
EFA program and that goes up what this
 
03:52:50.110 --> 03:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
bill does is it goes into the Statewide
 
03:52:52.710 --> 03:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
testing that regards public schools that
 
03:52:57.710 --> 03:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
is intended to allow this allow informed
 
03:52:59.389 --> 03:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
decisions that can be made concerning
 
03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum inservice education
 
03:53:03.070 --> 03:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
instructional Improvement teacher
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
training resource allocation and
 
03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
Staffing within our local public
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
districts adding this into the statute
 
03:53:11.349 --> 03:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and non gerine to any
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
public any private school or home
 
03:53:14.910 --> 03:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
educated students because this does not
 
03:53:17.710 --> 03:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
deal with home educated students EFA
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
students or private schools this section
 
03:53:23.229 --> 03:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
is about public schools adding this
 
03:53:24.750 --> 03:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
language in is completely
 
03:53:26.590 --> 03:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
counterproductive to the choices that
 
03:53:28.349 --> 03:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
are allowed within the
 
03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
state quite frankly um this language
 
03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
does not work it creates mandates with
 
03:53:36.590 --> 03:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
that are not included in the statutes
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
that oversee home education EFA phas or
 
03:53:41.950 --> 03:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
private schools if you wanted to do this
 
03:53:43.830 --> 03:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
and include this incorporation into all
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
those different programs it would have
 
03:53:46.750 --> 03:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
to be drafted in an entirely different
 
03:53:49.229 --> 03:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
way um however I would like you to take
 
03:53:51.070 --> 03:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
a look and uh anybody who's interested
 
03:53:52.710 --> 03:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
in the EFA performance to look at the
 
03:53:54.429 --> 03:53:54.439 align:start position:0%
actual data that's reported out of that
 
03:53:56.429 --> 03:53:56.439 align:start position:0%
because it's a new program it's been a
 
03:53:57.870 --> 03:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
process in order to have those in and
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
have those reports however they seem to
 
03:54:01.469 --> 03:54:01.479 align:start position:0%
be doing just as good a job reporting
 
03:54:03.630 --> 03:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
that out as any of our local districts
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
so with that I am strongly opposed to
 
03:54:07.309 --> 03:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
this all of these rooms and overflows
 
03:54:09.189 --> 03:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
show you what happens when you threaten
 
03:54:10.750 --> 03:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
the rights of parents to educate their
 
03:54:13.149 --> 03:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
children especially those who don't take
 
03:54:15.910 --> 03:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
State funds and I'd be happy to take any
 
03:54:17.750 --> 03:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions of
 
03:54:19.110 --> 03:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
representa Le on yes representative
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you thank you and thank you
 
03:54:23.950 --> 03:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
for coming uh to testify today
 
03:54:26.149 --> 03:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative uh chairman lad said that
 
03:54:29.590 --> 03:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
there's four parts of um compulsory
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
education public school private school
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
home school and EFA does homeschool
 
03:54:36.550 --> 03:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
break down into two groups one that that
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
is an EFA Homeschool Group and um that
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
therefore would have a unique pupil
 
03:54:45.469 --> 03:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
identifier um versus homeschoolers that
 
03:54:47.710 --> 03:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
don't accept any money from the state
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that question legally
 
03:54:52.070 --> 03:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
if you take EFA funds it doesn't matter
 
03:54:53.910 --> 03:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
where you go to school whether it's a
 
03:54:56.110 --> 03:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
private school or if it's an allart
 
03:54:58.189 --> 03:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
education that you're having at home you
 
03:55:00.910 --> 03:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
are legally an EFA student under I think
 
03:55:00.920 --> 03:55:01.630 align:start position:0%
are legally an EFA student under I think
it's

03:55:01.630 --> 03:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:55:04.030 --> 03:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
193f um it's an entirely different
 
03:55:07.309 --> 03:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
statute than 193a which regulates home
 
03:55:09.910 --> 03:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
educated students those are students who
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
do not have acid they notify their
 
03:55:15.149 --> 03:55:15.159 align:start position:0%
agency and their parents are responsible
 
03:55:17.950 --> 03:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
for their education and their curriculum
 
03:55:19.790 --> 03:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
in order to show that they be able to
 
03:55:21.710 --> 03:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
show that they are having progress they
 
03:55:24.149 --> 03:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
have to either take a Statewide test uh
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
sorry take a standardized test it can be
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
I you can use the old California 90s
 
03:55:30.149 --> 03:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
ones that worked for my husband and I
 
03:55:32.750 --> 03:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
and that we use with our kids because we
 
03:55:34.590 --> 03:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
understand what those measure or you can
 
03:55:36.830 --> 03:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
have a portfolio review you also retain
 
03:55:38.349 --> 03:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
a portfolio of your work and your
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
reading list
 
03:55:41.110 --> 03:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
so there already are good guarantees for
 
03:55:42.630 --> 03:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
those who are trying to look over a
 
03:55:44.550 --> 03:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
parent shoulder in the case of an
 
03:55:46.149 --> 03:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
educational neglect but those are not
 
03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
reported up to the state it would be a
 
03:55:50.510 --> 03:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
wholesale change in order to require
 
03:55:52.469 --> 03:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
homeschool students to go take the same
 
03:55:54.630 --> 03:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
standardized test at a public school and
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's a massive unfunded mandate if you
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
would have to have those kids come into
 
03:56:00.269 --> 03:56:00.279 align:start position:0%
the school and take the test at the
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
local public school that would be a
 
03:56:04.030 --> 03:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous cost to our local districts
 
03:56:05.229 --> 03:56:05.239 align:start position:0%
and right now we're trying to make sure
 
03:56:07.710 --> 03:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
that everything can be provided
 
03:56:10.030 --> 03:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately yes go ahead representor
 
03:56:12.269 --> 03:56:12.279 align:start position:0%
so I just want to I want to understand
 
03:56:15.070 --> 03:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
that you can homeschool and take an EFA
 
03:56:16.590 --> 03:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
or you can homeschool and not take an
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
EFA is that correct no you're not
 
03:56:20.590 --> 03:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
homeschooling if you take an it's not
 
03:56:22.429 --> 03:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
legally considered homeschooling if you
 
03:56:24.269 --> 03:56:24.279 align:start position:0%
take I'll clarify that for everybody
 
03:56:27.149 --> 03:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
here if you're a homeschool student and
 
03:56:30.070 --> 03:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
you choose to take an EFA you are now an
 
03:56:34.389 --> 03:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
EFA student not a h school student in
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
conjunction with compulsory
 
03:56:39.429 --> 03:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
attendance for further questions
 
03:56:41.710 --> 03:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you Mr chair and
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to take my
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
question we've had a lot of sort of back
 
03:56:46.389 --> 03:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
and forth and I think it's been a little
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
confusing about um what is an EFA versus
 
03:56:52.030 --> 03:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
what is
 
03:56:54.269 --> 03:56:54.279 align:start position:0%
homeschooling but the way I'm looking at
 
03:56:56.590 --> 03:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
this and correct me if I'm wrong to see
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
if you read this the same way the very
 
03:57:00.510 --> 03:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
first one of the first changes it says
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
this applies to all learning
 
03:57:04.670 --> 03:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
environments and then lower in the bill
 
03:57:08.070 --> 03:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
it says um home educated students shall
 
03:57:10.149 --> 03:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
contact their local districts to
 
03:57:11.870 --> 03:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
participate in the Statewide assessment
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
so isn't this really just neither here
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
nor there this is about all homeschool
 
03:57:19.750 --> 03:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
students um thank you for that question
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
it actually goes beyond just all
 
03:57:22.950 --> 03:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
students who learn at home whether
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
they're a 193a homeschooler or somebody
 
03:57:27.710 --> 03:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
who takes an EFA this also goes to
 
03:57:29.710 --> 03:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
private school students quite frankly if
 
03:57:31.149 --> 03:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
you look at this it would also include
 
03:57:33.149 --> 03:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
anybody in the Department of Corrections
 
03:57:34.349 --> 03:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if those are already
 
03:57:36.830 --> 03:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
included in those it also does not allow
 
03:57:38.990 --> 03:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
the freedom to opt out that's provided
 
03:57:41.110 --> 03:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
to students in our local public schools
 
03:57:43.750 --> 03:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
so you know quite frankly not only is it
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
poorly drafted it includes uh unfunded
 
03:57:48.429 --> 03:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
mandate onto our local districts it's
 
03:57:50.149 --> 03:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
also discriminatory because it doesn't
 
03:57:52.269 --> 03:57:52.279 align:start position:0%
provide the same accommodations as we
 
03:57:54.469 --> 03:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
have to our students in our Public
 
03:57:57.389 --> 03:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
Schools further questions from the
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh representative John
 
03:58:08.670 --> 03:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
sers yes by way no protocol usually has
 
03:58:11.590 --> 03:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
the uh sponsor waiting to come back
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
since you have such a long period of
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
time for Testimony would you allow the
 
03:58:17.189 --> 03:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor to come back and sit down please
 
03:58:19.269 --> 03:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
oh represent cascaden can come back she
 
03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
just can't ask questions oh she wouldn't
 
03:58:26.149 --> 03:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
yeah are you speaking for her no that's
 
03:58:28.830 --> 03:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
decision representa sers welcome thank
 
03:58:33.189 --> 03:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I thank you committee I
 
03:58:35.830 --> 03:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
represented sellers Grafton district 18
 
03:58:38.710 --> 03:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
I represented the 107 towns of graft
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
about 17,000 residents I just wanted
 
03:58:42.870 --> 03:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
when I started looking at this bill I
 
03:58:44.269 --> 03:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
just want to started picking it apart
 
03:58:46.830 --> 03:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying you know as as one of the
 
03:58:48.229 --> 03:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
representatives just pointed out here it
 
03:58:50.790 --> 03:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
says all learning environments when you
 
03:58:52.110 --> 03:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
use that word
 
03:58:54.750 --> 03:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
all now it gets very you know where do
 
03:58:57.149 --> 03:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
we go do we go to court does the school
 
03:58:58.750 --> 03:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
district say well it says all learning
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
environments you know so it says all
 
03:59:03.510 --> 03:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't say some it says all the other
 
03:59:04.870 --> 03:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
thing that I noticed in pointing out
 
03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
here on line five it says in mathematics
 
03:59:12.750 --> 03:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
at minimum so the the word at minimum or
 
03:59:15.630 --> 03:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
at minimum there is my point is so do
 
03:59:17.469 --> 03:59:17.479 align:start position:0%
they have to do
 
03:59:21.630 --> 03:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
English reading mathematics now they now
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
this District says oh well we want you
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
to test in science uh we want you to
 
03:59:27.990 --> 03:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
test now in history as well you know
 
03:59:30.870 --> 03:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
again it's just saying at minimum so I
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
mean who makes that decision at minimum
 
03:59:35.750 --> 03:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
and again was pointed out here it does
 
03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
say which I've learned actually today
 
03:59:39.070 --> 03:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for helping explain this it
 
03:59:41.710 --> 03:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
does say home educated students and I
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
didn't realize efas were different than
 
03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
home educated so that's interesting and
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look up and read up on that
 
03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
myself to see what that now is but again
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
as the representative before me said
 
03:59:56.469 --> 03:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
there's no opt out and it says these
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
these students shall that means they
 
04:00:00.670 --> 04:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
have to there is no opt out our public
 
04:00:03.149 --> 04:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
school has opt out but these kids don't
 
04:00:05.229 --> 04:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
have opt out same thing with private
 
04:00:08.590 --> 04:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
schools it says shall all right no if
 
04:00:11.429 --> 04:00:11.439 align:start position:0%
butt they shall there's no opt out uh
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
situation for them as well the other
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
couple things I were thinking about here
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm saying just to keep everybody in
 
04:00:20.590 --> 04:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
mind our Public Schools they're failing
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
I mean about 50% of the kids are failing
 
04:00:24.870 --> 04:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
when you when you take these tests and
 
04:00:26.550 --> 04:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
you look at them you go on the doe
 
04:00:29.229 --> 04:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
Report website and you can see they show
 
04:00:32.349 --> 04:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
you the scores for for uh English Math
 
04:00:35.590 --> 04:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
and Science and almost 50% are failing

my name is Michelle lvll and I'm the
 
04:01:26.429 --> 04:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
director of Granite State Home Educators
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
an all volunteer nonprofit with over
 
04:01:32.990 --> 04:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
16,000 members across the state I've
 
04:01:35.349 --> 04:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
been involved in Broad education choice
 
04:01:37.269 --> 04:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
and alternative initiatives for nearly
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
there is no compelling reason for this
 
04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill I remind the committee that just
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
two years ago HB 1663 passed this
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee with a 19 to1 ought to pass
 
04:01:54.070 --> 04:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
vote among other things HB 1663 created
 
04:01:56.070 --> 04:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
a More Level Playing Field for home
 
04:01:57.870 --> 04:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
educated children regardless of
 
04:02:01.630 --> 04:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
Assessments the homeed statute RSA 193a
 
04:02:04.110 --> 04:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
now says that independent homeschooled
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
children must do an in an annual
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
assessment and show quote Pro
 
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
commensurate with age ability and or
 
04:02:13.950 --> 04:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
disability what has changed to mandate
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
these children now take the same
 
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment that is
 
04:02:18.389 --> 04:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
administered in their local public
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
schools I understand an amendment may be
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
offered to remove independent
 
04:02:24.550 --> 04:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers from this heavy-handed
 
04:02:28.469 --> 04:02:28.479 align:start position:0%
bill I would support such an amendment
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
however until it is introduced I cannot
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
make specific comments to it I caution
 
04:02:35.349 --> 04:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
the committee that on any amendment that
 
04:02:37.269 --> 04:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
requires participation in the Statewide
 
04:02:39.950 --> 04:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
assessment however many public school
 
04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
teachers abhor highstakes tests because
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
they are not good reflections of
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
achievement and take away valuable
 
04:02:49.389 --> 04:02:49.399 align:start position:0%
learning time even the National educ
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
Education Association stated that public
 
04:02:53.950 --> 04:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
education should quote think beyond the
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
bubble end quote regarding standardized
 
04:02:59.229 --> 04:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
testing some States including Florida
 
04:03:01.550 --> 04:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
Georgia and New York in bipartisan
 
04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
efforts are rethinking their
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
standardized testing and graduation
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
requirements children are more than test
 
04:03:09.389 --> 04:03:09.399 align:start position:0%
scores and there are other ways to have
 
04:03:11.630 --> 04:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
accountability of government funded
 
04:03:14.670 --> 04:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
education in 2 days the committee will
 
04:03:18.429 --> 04:03:18.439 align:start position:0%
exec on hb610 remember the faces you see
 
04:03:20.149 --> 04:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
in the audience today and remember the
 
04:03:22.149 --> 04:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
compelling stories you're told please
 
04:03:24.750 --> 04:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
vote this Bill itl thank you very much
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
not see anything yes representative
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
Cornell thank you and thank you we
 
04:03:34.149 --> 04:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
haven't seen you in ages so it's nice to
 
04:03:36.510 --> 04:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
see you and I can't remember from HB
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
1663 you said that a report had to be
 
04:03:41.790 --> 04:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
made and and I can't
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
remember who that goes to or what or
 
04:03:46.510 --> 04:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
what it is because I in the old days I
 
04:03:48.670 --> 04:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
remember as a guance council or
 
04:03:51.309 --> 04:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
portfolio review or whatever and I know
 
04:03:53.070 --> 04:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
that's changed and I can't remember what
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
happens now sure so incurrent statute H
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh house it's uh RSA 193a I believe it's
 
04:04:03.870 --> 04:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
subsection five please correct me if I'm
 
04:04:06.030 --> 04:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
wrong it's either five or six I think
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
six um it asks all independent unfunded
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers to still keep a portfolio
 
04:04:16.110 --> 04:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
that includes a reading list and work
 
04:04:18.030 --> 04:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
samples of whatever their child has been
 
04:04:20.710 --> 04:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
doing that is their private property
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's retained by the family they also
 
04:04:26.429 --> 04:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
must do some sort of annual assessment
 
04:04:27.910 --> 04:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
and the Cho there are three broad
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
choices at the parents discretion it can
 
04:04:32.189 --> 04:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
be a standardized test it can be a
 
04:04:34.950 --> 04:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
portfolio review by a teacher or
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
something else that shows quote progress
 
04:04:38.910 --> 04:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
commensurate with with age ability and
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
or disability all of that is retained by
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
the family and part of their child's
 
04:04:46.149 --> 04:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
records so should they enroll in
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
something in their school and need to
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
show what their child has done to
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
qualify for a placement that is part of
 
04:04:54.030 --> 04:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
their records that they could do they
 
04:04:56.830 --> 04:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
could do that when they apply for dual
 
04:05:00.030 --> 04:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment or any other program or any
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
other thing that that child moves on to
 
04:05:04.830 --> 04:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
do it becomes essentially the uh
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
material for a transcript but it is
 
04:05:09.070 --> 04:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
accountability to the parents because
 
04:05:11.790 --> 04:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
they are the ones paying for it not the
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
state so it is the parents records
 
04:05:17.070 --> 04:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
should there ever be need for that
 
04:05:19.990 --> 04:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
information yes so these are the
 
04:05:22.710 --> 04:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
independent homeschool students that do
 
04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
not receive any money through efas or
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
anything else correct thank you further
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not see any
 
04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so Abigail
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%

voice for the children um I've been
 
04:06:02.269 --> 04:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
asking for the last few weeks what their
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
thoughts are on this for homeschoolers
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
that are unfunded huge words from them
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
they're big mad just you now they're
 
04:06:11.429 --> 04:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
angry their anxiety at having to be in
 
04:06:14.590 --> 04:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
an unknown area to be performing a test
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
they're being forced to take a test that
 
04:06:18.670 --> 04:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
they are unknown to taking when they're
 
04:06:21.910 --> 04:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
used to like a pfolio they're not
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
learning to test they're learning for
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
life skills they're learning for life
 
04:06:27.389 --> 04:06:27.399 align:start position:0%
they don't stop at 18 they're being
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
taught to continue their education
 
04:06:31.630 --> 04:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
they're mad they're upset they're scared
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
about taking a test in school being
 
04:06:35.229 --> 04:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
supervised by an untrusted unknown
 
04:06:38.149 --> 04:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
person or persons being in in a room
 
04:06:40.269 --> 04:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
with kids that they don't know having
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
the anxiety of doing so sad that my
 
04:06:43.269 --> 04:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
parents are being asked to take me
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere I've never been not right will
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
not answer the test mean why not cool no
 
04:06:53.070 --> 04:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
fun not fair I test every year or I get
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
a portfolio every year why should I have
 
04:06:57.070 --> 04:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
to go sit in a public school didn't the
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%

don't want to go in an unfamiliar
strange

04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%

time I have disabilities learning is
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%

to my son he has issues with State
 
04:07:34.630 --> 04:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
tested time tests we use the California
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
state test or have a qualified teacher
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
reveal our portfolio why should I have
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
to sit time pressures this is a reward
 
04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
for the school not for
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
me um undermines and minimizes every
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
single reason we choose to homeschool
 
04:07:51.870 --> 04:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
these are from children mind you not the
 
04:07:55.309 --> 04:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
adults um they said we use different
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
programs than what the school uses we
 
04:07:58.870 --> 04:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't use common core standards time's
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
up thank you any questions uh if you
 
04:08:03.670 --> 04:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
have written testimony there this is
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
yours great thank you very much are
 
04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent Hall thank you Mr chair
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I was
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
just curious um after hearing the prime
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor introduce the bill do you feel
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
comfortable or that it does not include
 
04:08:23.109 --> 04:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers well as of right now as
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
it's written it states that
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers whether we take any type
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
of funding unfunded or funded that we
 
04:08:31.229 --> 04:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
are being required to participate in our
 
04:08:34.109 --> 04:08:34.119 align:start position:0%
Public Schools okay follow up yes so do
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
you if it were um I guess do you believe
 
04:08:40.510 --> 04:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
that the amendment would come across
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
that the homeschoolers do well let me
 
04:08:44.750 --> 04:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase that do you believe that
 
04:08:48.109 --> 04:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor does her intent was
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
not to include the home schools not as
 
04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
written you know not as written but she
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
testified that okay thank you on the
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
same path do you believe that private
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
schools should be required as it stays
 
04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
on the next line down from the lines 15
 
04:09:07.790 --> 04:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
and 16 to 16 and 177 they're required to
 
04:09:09.870 --> 04:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
participate do they take State funding
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
should holderness do it Kimble Union do
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
it do they take State funding do they
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
take our tax money I think you've asked
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
answer my question
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
yep repan
 
04:09:22.670 --> 04:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
luno thank you Mr chair so just just
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
following on on that um uh what if um
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
what if this testing requirement either
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
being a Statewide test or a a national
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh um Norm reference test uh were to
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
apply to uh uh student
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
students uh basically EFA students they
 
04:09:45.269 --> 04:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
take State funding right correct they're
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
using state tax dollars to fund their
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
program because they choose not to pull
 
04:09:51.189 --> 04:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
it out of their own Pockets or give up
 
04:09:53.229 --> 04:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
something that they don't want then they
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
are under the government standards why
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
not they're taking funds from the tax
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
pay payers or any program that it is set
 
04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
aside for I'm technically putting tax
 
04:10:07.149 --> 04:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
money in it's funding that somehow they
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
need to have accountability of course
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
because it's got down to the bottom of
 
04:10:12.109 --> 04:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
accounting Alliance that you need to
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
know where the money is going why not
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that that child is actually
 
04:10:17.910 --> 04:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
being tested appropriately for the
 
04:10:19.790 --> 04:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
program that they're using I personally
 
04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
have chosen not to choose to have my
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
children in a public studing in any form
 
04:10:25.550 --> 04:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
in any time of their education and I
 
04:10:27.149 --> 04:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
choose to test them or have them
 
04:10:30.149 --> 04:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
reviewed as I see fit I don't have to
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
review in terms of from the educational
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
board unless you guys ask me if I'm
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
following my letter of the law yeah I'll
 
04:10:38.910 --> 04:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
show show you my totes have
 
04:10:42.510 --> 04:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
fun thank you you have a question thank
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:10:45.870 --> 04:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
question just along that same line
 
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
although um homeschoolers that take efas
 
04:10:50.910 --> 04:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
are called EFA students they're still
 
04:10:54.149 --> 04:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
kind of doing the same program um and
 
04:10:57.510 --> 04:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if the assessment that's
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
available in the education Freedom count
 
04:11:01.870 --> 04:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
statute that's not an assessment test
 
04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
but a portfolio would then meet your
 
04:11:07.229 --> 04:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
requirements sure if that's stated in
 
04:11:09.870 --> 04:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
the law for their EFA you
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
know for being part of that program yes
 
04:11:14.910 --> 04:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
that would qualify all right would you
 
04:11:19.229 --> 04:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
be um um would you mind if they were uh
 
04:11:21.550 --> 04:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
required to take assessments only would
 
04:11:25.229 --> 04:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
that bother you no thank you repent
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
you for being here along the same lines
 
04:11:33.070 --> 04:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
of reasoning if this mandated that all
 
04:11:33.080 --> 04:11:34.070 align:start position:0%
of reasoning if this mandated that all
students

04:11:34.070 --> 04:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:11:37.550 --> 04:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
were in to take this test would do you
 
04:11:39.790 --> 04:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
see that less students would choose to
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
in addition to a portfolio and achieve
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
the amazing things that they make in the
 
04:11:47.189 --> 04:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
portfolio would there be less
 
04:11:49.469 --> 04:11:49.479 align:start position:0%
portfolios as an unfunded homeschooler
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm required to keep a portfolio
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
regardless if I use a standardized test
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
or not okay and the same goes I'm
 
04:11:58.030 --> 04:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
assuming for the EFA loan they are
 
04:11:59.790 --> 04:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
required to keep your portfolio also
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
correct yeah so a followup you'd have to
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
report twice one for the test and one
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
for the port folio it seems to be twice
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
as much am I correct I believe the EFA
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
loan that they are required
 
04:12:16.990 --> 04:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
to put their testing portfolio whatever
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
it is that's required of them towards
 
04:12:21.070 --> 04:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
whatever board is in charge of that
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
whereas me I'm not required to show
 
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
anyone unless somebody is in doubt that
 
04:12:27.070 --> 04:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
I am educating my children correctly
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
that clarifies a lot thank you yes
 
04:12:29.399 --> 04:12:30.389 align:start position:0%
that clarifies a lot thank you yes
further

04:12:30.389 --> 04:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:12:32.590 --> 04:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
much uh Aubrey Freeman followed by Karen
 
04:12:42.269 --> 04:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
Weeden Mr chair afternoon again yeah
 
04:12:47.670 --> 04:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay Aubrey Friedman Bridgewater speak
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill um okay if as
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
as far as homeschoolers there should be
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
no question they are doing all the job
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
themselves incurring the expans not
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
being able to work a full-time job
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be so and actually
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
paying for other kids uh education too
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
so there should be absolutely no testing
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
requirement on them um and there
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
actually there already is that
 
04:13:21.149 --> 04:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation 193 A6 part two has been
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned already so okay about this
 
04:13:24.000 --> 04:13:25.309 align:start position:0%
mentioned already so okay about this
whole

04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
testing fancy scheme as was mentioned by
 
04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative belart even if you had it
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
even just the EFA students alone the
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
ones who take the state money leave
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
alone the homeschoolers what is it
 
04:13:41.950 --> 04:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
actually going to accomplish I mean we
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
see how the government schools do you
 
04:13:46.389 --> 04:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
can pull up any school district or
 
04:13:48.670 --> 04:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
individual school and see the
 
04:13:51.070 --> 04:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
results yeah it's
 
04:13:53.550 --> 04:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
transparent uh the results have been
 
04:13:57.070 --> 04:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
lousy for years before Co after Co what
 
04:14:00.670 --> 04:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
does it actually accomplished now $2.5
 
04:14:02.830 --> 04:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
million do of taxpayer dollars this
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
would be an ongoing thing to um
 
04:14:07.870 --> 04:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
Institute this whole
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
uh testing scheme that would apply
 
04:14:13.630 --> 04:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's per the fiscal note to all the uh
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
EFA and I guess everybody says all
 
04:14:18.149 --> 04:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
learning environments what would be
 
04:14:21.030 --> 04:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
accomplished by it to be honest um I
 
04:14:23.309 --> 04:14:23.319 align:start position:0%
just don't see the advantage and then
 
04:14:25.469 --> 04:14:25.479 align:start position:0%
just the fact that every it's also
 
04:14:28.750 --> 04:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
privacy issue too uh let's see it's uh
 
04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
part one article 2B the New Hampshire
 
04:14:35.109 --> 04:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
Constitution a right to privacy from
 
04:14:37.229 --> 04:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
government intrusion you'd have to to
 
04:14:41.469 --> 04:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
have a state uh assigned ID that's like
 
04:14:44.189 --> 04:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
a a registry basically and a government
 
04:14:46.590 --> 04:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
registry what could possibly go wrong
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
with that so I I definitely have
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
problems with that's a big privacy issue
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
um and that's basically it I don't think
 
04:14:57.149 --> 04:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
this bill would actually accomplish
 
04:14:59.469 --> 04:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
anything thank you very much are there
 
04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
 
04:15:01.359 --> 04:15:02.429 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
representative

04:15:02.429 --> 04:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:15:04.269 --> 04:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
04:15:06.030 --> 04:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you realize that
 
04:15:09.229 --> 04:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
if they take an FAA they have to have a
 
04:15:12.309 --> 04:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
unique pupil identifier sassa with the
 
04:15:14.950 --> 04:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education with the
 
04:15:17.229 --> 04:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
government well I guess if you take
 
04:15:19.269 --> 04:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
State money then you're giving up a
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of privacy so I can kind of
 
04:15:24.109 --> 04:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
understand that but that shouldn't apply
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
to the homeschoolers they should not
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
have to who don't take school yeah if
 
04:15:32.189 --> 04:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
you take the money you give up a little
 
04:15:34.950 --> 04:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
bit of privacy I I I think that's just
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
part of the uh the game I accept that
 
04:15:40.710 --> 04:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
04:15:43.630 --> 04:15:43.640 align:start position:0%

04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you chairman lad honorable
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives my name is Karen tol I'm
 
04:16:17.229 --> 04:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
a resident of miramac New Hampshire I'm
 
04:16:19.870 --> 04:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
a 24-year homeschooler I probably look
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
it and I'm also in leadership for
 
04:16:24.269 --> 04:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
Granite State Home Educators but today I
 
04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk to you not as a member of
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
leadership but just as a
 
04:16:30.670 --> 04:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I'm really concerned about the
 
04:16:32.830 --> 04:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of this bill
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden I really
 
04:16:35.950 --> 04:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to do with
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
accountability and I do appreciate that
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this is the way we're
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
adding millions of dollars to a program
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
that is already costing me tens of
 
04:16:48.750 --> 04:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
millions and with our recent
 
04:16:51.429 --> 04:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
expansion hundreds of millions
 
04:16:53.790 --> 04:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
potentially we're disrupting our Public
 
04:16:57.070 --> 04:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
Schools if we bring people into test we
 
04:16:58.469 --> 04:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
know that our children are struggling
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
already in public schools imagine the
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
chaos When You Haul in the thousands of
 
04:17:06.309 --> 04:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
Home Educators vac students private
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
school students and EFA students into a
 
04:17:11.550 --> 04:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
local District who has to accommodate
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
them and then administer the tests and
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
then finally I'm sure you've heard it's
 
04:17:18.750 --> 04:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
stressful for anyone who's not already
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the system further if you ask any
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
public school teacher what benefit are
 
04:17:25.710 --> 04:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
we really getting out of these tests are
 
04:17:27.189 --> 04:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
we serving our
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
students but I want to talk as a
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer about accountability because if
 
04:17:34.149 --> 04:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
you're spending my dollars on it I agree
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
with you they owe us some accountability
 
04:17:39.070 --> 04:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we need a separate
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation for this I think
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
that we can accomplish it right within
 
04:17:46.710 --> 04:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
194f the EFA law already they are
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
required to either have a nationally
 
04:17:53.229 --> 04:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
standardized Norm reference test or take
 
04:17:55.950 --> 04:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
the state Statewide student assessment
 
04:17:59.109 --> 04:17:59.119 align:start position:0%
or complete a portfolio so would it be
 
04:18:00.830 --> 04:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
possible to amend
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
194f to make for example if you really
 
04:18:05.950 --> 04:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
want State testing for efas you could do
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
it right Within
 
04:18:07.640 --> 04:18:11.790 align:start position:0%
it right Within
194

04:18:11.790 --> 04:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:14.830 --> 04:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
second we can change how we're operating
 
04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
the EFA right now they do have the
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to submit assessment tests
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
however my understanding is it's just a
 
04:18:25.229 --> 04:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
dialogue box on a form no one ever looks
 
04:18:27.630 --> 04:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
at the actual results and we're doing it
 
04:18:30.070 --> 04:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
on the honor System so just by
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
submitting the actual report the
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
committee may feel more comfortable with
 
04:18:36.870 --> 04:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
the accountability of that student your
 
04:18:39.389 --> 04:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
your time is up thank you sir thank you
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
very much for coming are there questions
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:18:45.870 --> 04:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
committee thank you appreciate it uh
 
04:18:45.880 --> 04:18:47.670 align:start position:0%
committee thank you appreciate it uh

04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
zuk good
 
04:18:59.710 --> 04:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Amanda Weeden and
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
I'm a veteran homeschool mom from
 
04:19:03.469 --> 04:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
Rochester New Hampshire I'm a longtime
 
04:19:05.550 --> 04:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
leader in Granite State Home Educators
 
04:19:07.109 --> 04:19:07.119 align:start position:0%
and Christian Home educator of New
 
04:19:09.149 --> 04:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Southern Maine I'm also a
 
04:19:10.710 --> 04:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
special needs homeschooling advocate in
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I've served on heak The
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
Homeschool um home education advisory
 
04:19:18.750 --> 04:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
council is co-chair and I am an unfunded
 
04:19:22.710 --> 04:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
traditional RSA 193 home educator to be
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
clear none of my children are or will
 
04:19:29.189 --> 04:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
ever be in any other educational pathway
 
04:19:31.630 --> 04:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
those available in New Hampshire those
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
of us who want nothing to do with
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
government money and the strong push for
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
extreme unnecessary oversight have now
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
been forced to come up with terms like
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded traditional RSA 193a
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers because the EFA
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
educational pathway legislators and
 
04:19:50.670 --> 04:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
organizations don't understand the
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
difference to be honest I don't want to
 
04:19:55.109 --> 04:19:55.119 align:start position:0%
be here right now poorly written
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
legislation started this mess and by the
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
looks of it it's going to continue ad
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
nauseum in other attempts to regulate
 
04:20:04.510 --> 04:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
the EFA program I've been silent because
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
frankly who can keep up
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
Not Me Home Educators who understand the
 
04:20:13.309 --> 04:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
implications of the EFA program on our
 
04:20:14.910 --> 04:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
freedom in New Hampshire were pushed out
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
of the conversation from the beginning
 
04:20:19.750 --> 04:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
and this the bill that was literally
 
04:20:22.030 --> 04:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
ransomed in the budget bill was sloppy
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
that bill was sloppy this bill is also
 
04:20:27.469 --> 04:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
sloppy it's interesting to me that an
 
04:20:29.349 --> 04:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
entire side of the aisle where I usually
 
04:20:32.109 --> 04:20:32.119 align:start position:0%
land myself has hitched its wagon into a
 
04:20:34.630 --> 04:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
program that's not transparent with
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
proponents who benefit immensely either
 
04:20:38.910 --> 04:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
financially or politically the pattern
 
04:20:41.469 --> 04:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
in other states that we're seeing it's
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
the same Trend in the legislates that
 
04:20:45.109 --> 04:20:45.119 align:start position:0%
have these types of programs and people
 
04:20:47.070 --> 04:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
are starting to wake up to the long-term
 
04:20:50.109 --> 04:20:50.119 align:start position:0%
term implications that they will produce
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
so I could go on about how disastrous
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
the EFA bill has been for home education
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but my needing to be
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
here right now is proved
 
04:21:03.309 --> 04:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
positive I want legislators to do better
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
I want our representatives to consult
 
04:21:07.389 --> 04:21:07.399 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who do not benefit
 
04:21:09.630 --> 04:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
financially or politically from outcom
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:14.950 --> 04:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
up now do you have written testimony
 
04:21:16.750 --> 04:21:16.760 align:start position:0%

1610 uh I should also note that I am
 
04:21:59.710 --> 04:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
currently a certified teacher I hold a
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
certification in the state of
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and I have 10 years of
 
04:22:02.279 --> 04:22:03.309 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and I have 10 years of
teaching

04:22:03.309 --> 04:22:03.319 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
04:22:05.790 --> 04:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
experience uh even as a public school
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
teacher I was not in favor of
 
04:22:11.429 --> 04:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
standardized assessments and now as a
 
04:22:14.429 --> 04:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
homeschooling mother absolutely I am not
 
04:22:17.429 --> 04:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
standardized assessments don't give you
 
04:22:20.309 --> 04:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
a depiction a proper depiction of what a
 
04:22:23.070 --> 04:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
child knows and what that child's
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
individual strengths
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
are as a homeschooling parent I document
 
04:22:32.830 --> 04:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
my daughter's growth through a portfolio
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
that shows her individual growth it
 
04:22:37.229 --> 04:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
shows her
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
strs and there is so much more that we
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
do in homeschooling Beyond reading and
 
04:22:46.750 --> 04:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
math I don't want to be well I'm
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
unfunded so I'm I'm going to speak for
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
my uh EFA counterparts and I support
 
04:22:54.590 --> 04:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
them and not having to do standardized
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
tests either because we choose to to
 
04:22:59.109 --> 04:22:59.119 align:start position:0%
teach our children at home because we
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to give them standardized
 
04:23:03.710 --> 04:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
assessment I've seen what that leads to
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not interested in
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:06.830 align:start position:0%
I'm not interested in
it

04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:23:08.309 --> 04:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for today thank you
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
very much are comments from or questions
 
04:23:12.349 --> 04:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee that's thank you very much uh
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
next person is Sarah
 
04:23:29.550 --> 04:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.229 --> 04:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
sford I'm Sarah zck I live in Salsbury
 
04:23:36.670 --> 04:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm a 193 a
 
04:23:39.550 --> 04:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
homeschooling mother of four I'm here to
 
04:23:41.550 --> 04:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
vehemently oppose this
 
04:23:44.149 --> 04:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
bill my husband Marcus and I knew we
 
04:23:46.030 --> 04:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
would be homeschoolers before the birth
 
04:23:49.109 --> 04:23:49.119 align:start position:0%
of our first child we decided this
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
because we knew that no stranger could
 
04:23:53.950 --> 04:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
ever possibly be as invested in our
 
04:23:57.109 --> 04:23:57.119 align:start position:0%
children in the future of our family as
 
04:23:57.119 --> 04:23:57.870 align:start position:0%
children in the future of our family as
we

04:23:57.870 --> 04:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
are as parents we know that no stranger
 
04:24:02.550 --> 04:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
could ever possibly understand our
 
04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
children their learning styles or their
 
04:24:08.070 --> 04:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
individual needs better than we do
 
04:24:11.189 --> 04:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
as homeschoolers we enjoy the freedom to
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
create a curriculum that reflects our
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
fam's values and to cherry-pick all
 
04:24:18.910 --> 04:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
materials and any instructors from
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
outside our family who best support our
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
goals since our children possess strong
 
04:24:28.510 --> 04:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
vocabularies we chose a phonics based
 
04:24:31.469 --> 04:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
reading program because they see both of
 
04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
their parents working around their house
 
04:24:36.510 --> 04:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
we chose a self-paced math program based
 
04:24:38.830 --> 04:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
on conceptual intuition built from
 
04:24:38.840 --> 04:24:39.990 align:start position:0%
on conceptual intuition built from
practical

04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
practical
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
examples we are a Jewish Family a
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
portion of our curriculum is dedicated
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
to Jewish studies we carefully selected
 
04:24:50.670 --> 04:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
a Jewish studies instructor with
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
children in the same age bracket who we
 
04:24:55.269 --> 04:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
felt would be best suited to approach
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
cultural historical and Theological
 
04:25:00.109 --> 04:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
subject matter in a manner which Best
 
04:25:03.389 --> 04:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
Suits us my point is that time and
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
effort go into building both a
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum and Outsourcing assistance as
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
needed no two homeschooling families are
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
precisely the same just as no two
 
04:25:17.149 --> 04:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
students are precisely the same
 
04:25:19.550 --> 04:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers as a whole do share one
 
04:25:21.389 --> 04:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
important quality with the private and
 
04:25:23.910 --> 04:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
parochial school students who this would
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
also who would also be affected by this
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
bill regardless of the philosophy that
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
motivates them or the pedagogical
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
approaches they employ across all
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
categories of students in all types of
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
learning environments the fames this
 
04:25:42.630 --> 04:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
bill wishes to scrutinize perform better
 
04:25:44.189 --> 04:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
than the public school students your
 
04:25:47.950 --> 04:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
time is up it ignores okay thank you
 
04:25:51.389 --> 04:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
very much Sarah where do I pardon me yep
 
04:25:53.710 --> 04:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
okay right over there any questions from
 
04:25:56.670 --> 04:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you
 
04:25:56.680 --> 04:25:58.189 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you
again

04:25:58.189 --> 04:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:26:00.429 --> 04:26:00.439 align:start position:0%
uh Karina
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
Reitman uh lens Sanford then Lisa Cody
 
04:26:06.750 --> 04:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
Lisa had to leave
 
04:26:09.630 --> 04:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
this is not here
 
04:26:13.830 --> 04:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
Garcia well that's a young
 
04:26:19.349 --> 04:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
one not quite homeschooled yet but you
 
04:26:22.030 --> 04:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
know well everything you need to know is
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
learning in kindergarten you're getting
 
04:26:23.199 --> 04:26:24.710 align:start position:0%
learning in kindergarten you're getting
pretty

04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
close learning to uh roll over so far so
 
04:26:30.429 --> 04:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's our lesson at the moment
 
04:26:32.990 --> 04:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah my name is Karina Ryman and I live
 
04:26:36.229 --> 04:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
in Bradford New Hampshire and I I I
 
04:26:37.750 --> 04:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
homeschooled my children without any
 
04:26:37.760 --> 04:26:38.830 align:start position:0%
homeschooled my children without any
state

04:26:38.830 --> 04:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:26:41.349 --> 04:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
funding I want to say that to me this
 
04:26:44.429 --> 04:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
bill is basically a bureaucratic
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
intrusion into uh something that we
 
04:26:49.469 --> 04:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers are already
 
04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
doing um it seems we've met many people
 
04:26:54.309 --> 04:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
of I think all homeschooling families
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
have made many people who seem to have
 
04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of grudge against
 
04:27:01.950 --> 04:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
homeschooling uh for some reason and uh
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
I think they try to make it go away in
 
04:27:06.030 --> 04:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
some way or make it look as much as
 
04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
possible as public schools and um this
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
bill would basically be doing one one
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
more step in in that direction created
 
04:27:16.830 --> 04:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
this sort of rigid and state directed
 
04:27:20.189 --> 04:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
uniformity as opposed to the choice that
 
04:27:23.070 --> 04:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
we uh homeschooling families appreciate
 
04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
so much and the reason that we do this
 
04:27:29.070 --> 04:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh I have two older children besides
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
this one who I'm homeschooling I have
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
been a teacher for over 20 years I have
 
04:27:36.590 --> 04:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
master's degree in physics and moreover
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
I am the mother of my children so I
 
04:27:42.070 --> 04:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
think I know best what they need and how
 
04:27:45.469 --> 04:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
to evaluate what they are learning uh
 
04:27:46.830 --> 04:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would basically put that
 
04:27:49.149 --> 04:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
decision in the hands of a bunch of
 
04:27:51.149 --> 04:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats I don't see how that would
 
04:27:53.830 --> 04:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
be beneficial for anyone I have also
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
taught in schools and like others have
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
already said even School teachers think
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
standardized tests are terrible and uh
 
04:28:04.990 --> 04:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
they are useless moreover because
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
children's knowledge is not really
 
04:28:09.149 --> 04:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
represented in the results of these
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
tests so I'm not sure why we would want
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
to include even more children in
 
04:28:16.670 --> 04:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
something that is already
 
04:28:16.680 --> 04:28:18.910 align:start position:0%
something that is already
useless

04:28:18.910 --> 04:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
useless
 
04:28:23.670 --> 04:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
um the way to educational success is
 
04:28:25.590 --> 04:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
most likely not through even more
 
04:28:28.030 --> 04:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
regulation if regulation was the answer
 
04:28:29.790 --> 04:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
Public Schools would be doing amazing
 
04:28:31.510 --> 04:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
and um they're
 
04:28:35.830 --> 04:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
not so I just I think I want to urge you
 
04:28:37.870 --> 04:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
you to deem this bill inexpedient to
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislate it's adding absolutely nothing
 
04:28:42.189 --> 04:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
and creating more complications and
 
04:28:44.750 --> 04:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
something that already has a solution
 
04:28:46.309 --> 04:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
because we are already required to
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
evaluate our children thank you very
 
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
much for coming today from your very
 
04:28:50.910 --> 04:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
very busy
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
schedule any questions from the
 
04:28:56.750 --> 04:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee not see you thank you very
 
04:28:58.950 --> 04:28:58.960 align:start position:0%

good afternoon hi hi I had to cut this
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
down in two minutes so please bear with
 
04:29:22.469 --> 04:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
me um hello my name is Larin Sanford of
 
04:29:24.750 --> 04:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
gtown New Hampshire and I'm an EFA
 
04:29:27.109 --> 04:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
student the efas have added to our
 
04:29:28.710 --> 04:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
education with more learning
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities and experiences for my
 
04:29:32.710 --> 04:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
siblings and I for the past few years
 
04:29:34.269 --> 04:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
we've been going to a learning Co-op
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
once a week I've taken public speaking
 
04:29:38.109 --> 04:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
there which I'm putting into practice
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
right now and I'm currently taking a
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
class called seminar topics which covers
 
04:29:44.309 --> 04:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
a variety of subjects and through which
 
04:29:46.950 --> 04:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
we can explore possible career paths one
 
04:29:49.389 --> 04:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
of the topics we covered was on Aviation
 
04:29:50.910 --> 04:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm now considering getting my
 
04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
pilot's license in a few years a pilot
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
volunteered some time with me as a
 
04:29:57.269 --> 04:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
result and I discovered a love for
 
04:29:59.790 --> 04:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
flying my point in all of this is not
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
only to share some of the opportunities
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
we've had with the EFA program but to
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
show you that there is so much learning
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
to be done done outside of a public
 
04:30:09.389 --> 04:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
school setting we don't follow the exact
 
04:30:11.349 --> 04:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
timeline or the same curriculum as a
 
04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
public school student does my brothers
 
04:30:15.429 --> 04:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
and I take math and language arts
 
04:30:17.389 --> 04:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
lessons as well as the other required
 
04:30:20.269 --> 04:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
EFA School subjects with online and book
 
04:30:22.510 --> 04:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
resources and we do quizzes and tests
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
for these
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
subjects as an EFA family we also
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
already take approved standardized tests
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
and submit those through the CSF program
 
04:30:33.870 --> 04:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year to add the NH
 
04:30:35.710 --> 04:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
State assessments on top of all this
 
04:30:37.229 --> 04:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
would be redundant and a waste of
 
04:30:39.630 --> 04:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money you shouldn't lump all
 
04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
the educational Pathways under this bill
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
over the years our family has been part
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
of public school a traditional home
 
04:30:48.670 --> 04:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
education and now the EFA program and we
 
04:30:50.670 --> 04:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
know they are all covered under their
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
own rules and regulations with the state
 
04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
this is how it should remain this past
 
04:30:57.790 --> 04:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
year I've also developed an interest in
 
04:30:59.229 --> 04:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
politics and I've been given
 
04:31:00.990 --> 04:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities to go to events like the
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
first in nation Leadership Summit meet
 
04:31:05.710 --> 04:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
presidential candidates face to face and
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
have signed waved for several state and
 
04:31:09.630 --> 04:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
local elections I couldn't do these
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
things without the freedom and
 
04:31:13.710 --> 04:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
flexibility we have now in conclusion I
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
told my mom that in when I am old enough
 
04:31:18.510 --> 04:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
I might run for state state reps so that
 
04:31:20.670 --> 04:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
I can continue to protect educational
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
freedoms and school choice in our Live
 
04:31:24.830 --> 04:31:24.840 align:start position:0%

good afternoon my name is Jacqueline
 
04:32:13.349 --> 04:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
Garcia um we are a non-funded homeschool
 
04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
family from Meredith New Hampshire I am
 
04:32:19.349 --> 04:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
here today to ask you to oppose hb610
 
04:32:22.349 --> 04:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is too broad and infringes on
 
04:32:24.229 --> 04:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
our rights as homeschoolers in New
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the wording of this bill is
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
not specific to allowing home educated
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
students to be opted out by their
 
04:32:32.790 --> 04:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
parents yet clearly gives that option to
 
04:32:36.990 --> 04:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
public school students per RSA 193 A6 we
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
are already required by law as
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers to do a yearly assessment
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
and so requiring us to participate in a
 
04:32:46.750 --> 04:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment is redundant and
 
04:32:49.070 --> 04:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary home education is the
 
04:32:51.149 --> 04:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the parents not the
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
government and public
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
officials this bill would make New
 
04:32:56.910 --> 04:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the highest regulated state
 
04:32:56.920 --> 04:32:57.670 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the highest regulated state
for

04:32:57.670 --> 04:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooling homeschool freedom in New
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a major reason so very many
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
families including my own have relocated
 
04:33:07.429 --> 04:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
to this beautiful State and according to
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 193 A6 our assessment results are
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
private and this bill would violate that
 
04:33:14.830 --> 04:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
right so I'm asking you today to please
 
04:33:16.949 --> 04:33:16.959 align:start position:0%
oppose this Bill thank you thank you
 
04:33:19.230 --> 04:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions from the
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
04:33:25.510 --> 04:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
much thank you um Virginia

Martell hello my name is Virginia Avery
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm from Deerfield I'm a New
 
04:33:41.070 --> 04:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certified educator who has 15
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
years of experience teaching in both
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
public and private schools I am
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
currently a parent and a home educator
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
to my three children as well as a home
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
school portfolio evaluator I am speaking
 
04:33:56.750 --> 04:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
in opposition um to HB 1610 uh one of
 
04:33:58.269 --> 04:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
the biggest things uh that I want to
 
04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
point out is that current parents of
 
04:34:02.029 --> 04:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
public school children uh have the
 
04:34:03.869 --> 04:34:03.879 align:start position:0%
option of exempting their students from
 
04:34:06.150 --> 04:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
this testing and if this were to pass
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
home education parents would not be
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
given the same opportunity and I believe
 
04:34:11.629 --> 04:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
that there is no reason that any student
 
04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
choosing an educational pathway outside
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
of the public school system should have
 
04:34:18.029 --> 04:34:18.039 align:start position:0%
more restrictive regulations than
 
04:34:18.039 --> 04:34:19.429 align:start position:0%
more restrictive regulations than
traditional

04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
04:34:23.230 --> 04:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
students um also uh currently homeschool
 
04:34:25.470 --> 04:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
families um have the ability to contact
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
their school to take these State um
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
testing so if they feel um that
 
04:34:31.070 --> 04:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
participating in this test would be
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
better inform their instruction um they
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
can contact their school to do so uh it
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
would not be beneficial to mandate this
 
04:34:40.590 --> 04:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
it would also be illogical to burden the
 
04:34:42.070 --> 04:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
public school with such an outrageous
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
task when their time and resources will
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
be best used to serve the current
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
student population the bill is requiring
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
all students to enter the public school
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
to take this assessment and I want you
 
04:34:53.470 --> 04:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
to take a moment to think about what
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
that would actually look like students
 
04:34:57.310 --> 04:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
who have never foot um set foot in a
 
04:34:59.470 --> 04:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
public school before special education
 
04:35:01.709 --> 04:35:01.719 align:start position:0%
students students with anxiety sensory
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
processing disorder autism Behavior
 
04:35:05.709 --> 04:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
challenges just to list a few
 
04:35:07.590 --> 04:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
um the needs of these students cannot be
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
recognized by the public school since
 
04:35:11.830 --> 04:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're ineligible for an IEP unless
 
04:35:14.070 --> 04:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
they are fully enrolled they will now be
 
04:35:15.949 --> 04:35:15.959 align:start position:0%
required to take a test with zero
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
supports or
 
04:35:19.150 --> 04:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
accommodations I want to paint a picture
 
04:35:20.390 --> 04:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
of what that would look like for one of
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
my daughters in her home education she
 
04:35:24.269 --> 04:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
received specialized curriculum and
 
04:35:26.429 --> 04:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
instruction tailoring to her individual
 
04:35:29.390 --> 04:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
needs um some of which include speech um
 
04:35:31.470 --> 04:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
OT working with a child psychologist
 
04:35:33.949 --> 04:35:33.959 align:start position:0%
focusing on her anxiety if she required
 
04:35:36.150 --> 04:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
to take this test you could expect there
 
04:35:38.910 --> 04:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
to be crying crying screaming kicking
 
04:35:40.789 --> 04:35:40.799 align:start position:0%
flipping of chairs attempts to escape
 
04:35:42.750 --> 04:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
the room and likely refusal to enter the
 
04:35:44.590 --> 04:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
building to begin with um and so I'd
 
04:35:46.070 --> 04:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
like to just end by saying how could
 
04:35:47.629 --> 04:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
this mandated test be in the best
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
interest of these children's well-being
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
and educational progress thank you thank
 
04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
you very much represent
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you thank you for being here
 
04:35:58.189 --> 04:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
and taking my question could you just
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
inform us a bit more you comment about
 
04:36:03.629 --> 04:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
being a portfolio evaluator um can you
 
04:36:06.510 --> 04:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
tell us how that works yes um so one of
 
04:36:10.949 --> 04:36:10.959 align:start position:0%
the choices for um the RSA 193 um a
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers is they could get their
 
04:36:16.510 --> 04:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
portfolio evaluated by a licensed um
 
04:36:19.269 --> 04:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
teacher so I meet with parents we
 
04:36:21.310 --> 04:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
discuss goals we review their work
 
04:36:23.429 --> 04:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
samples um and through their work
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
samples they need to provide um evidence
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
that they're showing progress um conasur
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
with age and ability um and through this
 
04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
meeting and through look I look through
 
04:36:34.510 --> 04:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
their work samples um and then I will
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
confirm with my credentials that they
 
04:36:40.109 --> 04:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
have indeed um met the requirements and
 
04:36:42.629 --> 04:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
have shown progress over their Year's
 
04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
work thank you I got a question for you
 
04:36:49.070 --> 04:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
too as a a person that's taught before
 
04:36:51.551 --> 04:36:51.561 align:start position:0%
in the public schools I would assume was
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
public ver private either one yeah um do
 
04:36:57.070 --> 04:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
you believe that the Statewide
 
04:36:59.910 --> 04:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
assessment as we give in this state will
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
be aligned with your homeschooling
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
program and the objectives outcomes you
 
04:37:09.230 --> 04:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
expect at home I do not agree um as a
 
04:37:11.590 --> 04:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
homeschooler we are not obligated um by
 
04:37:14.150 --> 04:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
law to follow the same guidelines and
 
04:37:16.230 --> 04:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
the same standards that the schools use
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
um parents have autonomy to decide um
 
04:37:21.150 --> 04:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
what standards and uh what guidelines
 
04:37:22.269 --> 04:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
they would like to follow in what
 
04:37:24.789 --> 04:37:24.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum um and so the odds of it
 
04:37:26.830 --> 04:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
aligning with what public schools are
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
doing um are slim while there might be
 
04:37:32.109 --> 04:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
some that may align um there are many
 
04:37:34.029 --> 04:37:34.039 align:start position:0%
that I believe will not thank you very
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
much forther the questions from the
 
04:37:39.070 --> 04:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
committee thank you thank
 
04:37:45.789 --> 04:37:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
Freeman and uh Louise marel
 
04:37:54.310 --> 04:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:57.310 --> 04:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
Levante welcome hi I'm Marian Freeman
 
04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
from Sutton New Hampshire I'm a
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
traditional unfunded home education
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
parent under RSA 193a and I would ask
 
04:38:09.269 --> 04:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
you to oppose this bill I'm going to
 
04:38:11.269 --> 04:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
give you an example of something that
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
happened while my son was in public
 
04:38:19.310 --> 04:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
school and uh took part in an assessment
 
04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
that was computer
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
generated my understanding is that in
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
order for um tests to have True Value
 
04:38:29.789 --> 04:38:29.799 align:start position:0%
the students need to have been taught
 
04:38:32.109 --> 04:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
the material the questions need to
 
04:38:35.070 --> 04:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
reflect that material appropriately and
 
04:38:37.629 --> 04:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
the student needs to sit for the test in
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
an authentic manner in other words try
 
04:38:40.080 --> 04:38:40.869 align:start position:0%
an authentic manner in other words try
their

04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:38:44.830 --> 04:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
best so my son took a math assessment
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
and was so stressed out that uh he
 
04:38:51.551 --> 04:38:51.561 align:start position:0%
almost shut down at one moment he
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
decided to follow something he had heard
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
his mother say once which was when I was
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
in college if we didn't know the answer
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
we usually picked C and it worked out
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
okay and I didn't know that he had done
 
04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
this when I got his math results he
 
04:39:14.629 --> 04:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
scored average ability in math for grade
 
04:39:17.551 --> 04:39:17.561 align:start position:0%
seven which from what I knew of him I
 
04:39:20.269 --> 04:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
thought was a reasonable assessment then
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
I got the information from the math
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
teacher that told me which areas he
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
needed to work on in his weaknesses they
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
made no sense to me because I knew
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
everything that he knew so I went to him
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
and said said can you tell me what
 
04:39:38.430 --> 04:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
happened that day during the testing
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
because we were new to New Hampshire and
 
04:39:43.628 --> 04:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
new to the school district and
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
everything was new he explained to me
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
that he was stressed he didn't know what
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
to do he was afraid he wasn't going to
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
have time to complete and so he picked
 
04:39:54.910 --> 04:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
this nugget out of his memory and
 
04:39:57.470 --> 04:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
generally speaking picked C for the rest
 
04:40:00.750 --> 04:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
of the test he finished the test in
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
record time because he didn't really
 
04:40:05.628 --> 04:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
take time to review the
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
questions and the teachers and the
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors didn't note that he
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
had finished the test in about 15
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
minutes unfortunately your time is up so
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
all I want to say is these results from
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
any of these assessments are not helpful
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
to the students and they are a colossal
 
04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
waste of time and money and I don't
 
04:40:28.948 --> 04:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
support it and I ask you to also not
 
04:40:30.628 --> 04:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
vote for it thank you thank you very
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%

children that are currently using the
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
EFA accounts to homeschool I am here to
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
oppose hb610 homeschooling was never the
 
04:42:26.590 --> 04:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
plan until my son entered Berlin public
 
04:42:28.350 --> 04:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
school and had a very rough kindergarten
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
year he was new three months of the
 
04:42:32.750 --> 04:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum after nine months and Berlin
 
04:42:34.830 --> 04:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to move him to first grade that's
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
when we pulled him from public school we
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
have two more kids and then come to
 
04:42:41.270 --> 04:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
Child Number Four he was placed with us
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
at eight months of age in foster care
 
04:42:44.830 --> 04:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
and we adopted him when he was three
 
04:42:46.750 --> 04:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
between trauma and medical diagnosis
 
04:42:48.350 --> 04:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
multiple doctors recommended public
 
04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
school for the services and consistent
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
environment we debated and ultimately
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
decided to do half days at Berlin and
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
half day EFA student home with me since
 
04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
even after preschool at Min mounties 2
 
04:43:00.628 --> 04:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
days a week he would come home and
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
violently rock on our couch trying to
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
regulate he was considered a level five
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
for special education requiring a one
 
04:43:08.750 --> 04:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
toone perah from the moment he got off
 
04:43:10.990 --> 04:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
the special ed bus until he was back on
 
04:43:13.350 --> 04:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
the bus 2 and a half hours later he can
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
be a Flight Risk when overwhelmed
 
04:43:18.030 --> 04:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
however Berlin did not follow his IEP
 
04:43:20.190 --> 04:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
they were legally required to follow
 
04:43:21.990 --> 04:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
they thought bouncing a child with
 
04:43:23.550 --> 04:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
special needs between all four
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
kindergarten classes so his one toone
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
Aid could cover other students with
 
04:43:30.750 --> 04:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
their shortage of pairs was acceptable
 
04:43:32.430 --> 04:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
they also found it acceptable to send
 
04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
his one-on-one Aid to lunch he's only
 
04:43:36.550 --> 04:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
there for two and a half hours while he
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
was on the playground in no one to cover
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
that time period none of which was
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
communicated to us until my son got off
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
the bus one day saying he couldn't play
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
on the playground because he didn't have
 
04:43:47.590 --> 04:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
snow pants which were actually in his
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
background that is how I found out his
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
one-on-one was with another student and
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
he was on his own without the help he
 
04:43:55.550 --> 04:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
needed and it was happening over the
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
past month often so if burlin could not
 
04:44:01.150 --> 04:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
pro provide the proper staff when
 
04:44:03.230 --> 04:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
legally required how are the schools
 
04:44:04.750 --> 04:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
going to have the staff to come the
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
requirements for the testing or am I
 
04:44:08.550 --> 04:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to drop my Flight Risk child
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
off to a test and just hope when I go
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
back to pick him up that he is there
 
04:44:14.350 --> 04:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
safe and receive the commendations he
 
04:44:14.360 --> 04:44:15.230 align:start position:0%
safe and receive the commendations he
would

04:44:15.230 --> 04:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
need let the schools focus on those
 
04:44:18.990 --> 04:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
children and the parents of private
 
04:44:20.430 --> 04:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
schools focus on the children we have
 
04:44:22.628 --> 04:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
chosen to educate since sometimes those
 
04:44:24.310 --> 04:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
reasons are because the public school
 
04:44:26.350 --> 04:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
failed them and sending them back for a
 
04:44:28.948 --> 04:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
test with zero purpose is not acceptable
 
04:44:32.150 --> 04:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
your your time is up thank you are there
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%

um I'm the executive director of
 
04:45:11.470 --> 04:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
homeschool legal defense Association
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
action the policy armor of hslda um we
 
04:45:15.750 --> 04:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
have about 100,000 uh homeschool
 
04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
families Nationwide we are the world's
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
largest homeschool advocacy organization
 
04:45:21.230 --> 04:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of those families and along
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
with our allies Gran State Home
 
04:45:24.030 --> 04:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
Educators and Catholics United for home
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
education hsld strongly opposes hb610 in
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
its entirety this bill as drafted is not
 
04:45:32.350 --> 04:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
about educational freedoms accounts it's
 
04:45:34.990 --> 04:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
a in fact a high stakes test mandate
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
the bill would put New Hampshire at this
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
point below New York and Massachusetts
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
as the most hostile States for home
 
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
education in the United States uh
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative pelli was correct on
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
January 29th when she said that the
 
04:45:46.750 --> 04:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
testing mandate in this bill would cause
 
04:45:49.350 --> 04:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
concern for home education families uh
 
04:45:51.910 --> 04:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
we do have serious concerns home
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
education thrives in its freedom to
 
04:45:55.070 --> 04:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
recognize and respond to the uniqueness
 
04:45:57.150 --> 04:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
of each child as we've heard here today
 
04:45:58.990 --> 04:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
as someone who was home educated myself
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
and who educates my own children there's
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
a breathtaking amount of diversity and
 
04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
customization that exists within a
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
family um for how we teach each kid how
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
we're able to accommodate the needs of
 
04:46:09.948 --> 04:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
each kid between the parents and the
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
children the New Hampshire law already
 
04:46:13.590 --> 04:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
requires annual testing for
 
04:46:16.150 --> 04:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers as you well know uh this
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
is no need of changing this testing
 
04:46:19.390 --> 04:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
mandate would require homeschool
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
students to take Statewide assessments
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
built around the state s sols in a sense
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
just like public school students this is
 
04:46:26.510 --> 04:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
actually inferior to current law which
 
04:46:27.910 --> 04:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
is a nationally Norm reference
 
04:46:29.310 --> 04:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
standardized achievement test published
 
04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
and scored by an independent third party
 
04:46:34.230 --> 04:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
the replacement would preparis be of
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
Criterion assessment test judging a home
 
04:46:37.830 --> 04:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
School student's ability to regurgitate
 
04:46:38.948 --> 04:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
information based on public school
 
04:46:40.708 --> 04:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
learning objectives Public School
 
04:46:42.788 --> 04:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
teachers already consistently complain
 
04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
that they are forced to teach to the
 
04:46:46.548 --> 04:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
test at the expense of actual education
 
04:46:47.670 --> 04:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
this testing manate would drag
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers into that existing
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
Quagmire and that undercuts the secret
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
sauce that makes homeschooling Thrive
 
04:46:54.270 --> 04:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
with a back door implementation
 
04:46:56.190 --> 04:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
implementation of State mandated
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum trust New Hampshire citizens
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
to act responsibly and love their
 
04:47:01.270 --> 04:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
children and teach them well don't view
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
them with suspicion which this bill
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
communicates now Live Free or Die means
 
04:47:06.910 --> 04:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
something in New Hampshire and I trust
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
in this bill it still does thank you
 
04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
much for your time I urge you to vote
 
04:47:11.628 --> 04:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
against hb610 but I would be happy to
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee has
 
04:47:15.628 --> 04:47:15.638 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee thank
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
you very much Matt I'm not going to do
 
04:47:21.670 --> 04:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:26.830 --> 04:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:26.840 --> 04:47:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
door

04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
door
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
oh I was the one responsible for this
 
04:47:32.910 --> 04:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
you guys should have them at your desk
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.110 --> 04:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
you hello good afternoon Angela thank
 
04:47:56.548 --> 04:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
you for having us here um my name is
 
04:47:58.830 --> 04:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
Angela Turka I'm from do New Hampshire I
 
04:48:00.868 --> 04:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
am currently homeschooling three kids
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
one of which is still unregistered
 
04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
because he's only three
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
but he still gets homeschool Services um
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
we are unfunded of course and um I
 
04:48:13.590 --> 04:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and I'm asking you to
 
04:48:18.270 --> 04:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
do so as well um mandating testing of
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
any sort does not help our children to
 
04:48:22.350 --> 04:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
learn as I know people have mentioned
 
04:48:24.670 --> 04:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
teaching to a test doesn't actually
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
teach doesn't allow for that flexibility
 
04:48:28.990 --> 04:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
to really learn like our kids came down
 
04:48:30.788 --> 04:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
here to conquer it and they're looking
 
04:48:34.548 --> 04:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
at the buildings like holy moly and that
 
04:48:36.750 --> 04:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
is a learning experience just looking
 
04:48:38.910 --> 04:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
around and being able to do that that's
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
not teaching to a test if you're
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
teaching to a test you don't have time
 
04:48:42.590 --> 04:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:48:45.310 --> 04:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
stuff and it creates anxiety and can
 
04:48:48.030 --> 04:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
cause uh feelings of inadequacy and
 
04:48:50.670 --> 04:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
inferiority if they're doing less than
 
04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
average when kids have
 
04:48:56.070 --> 04:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
struggles um one of my daughters has had
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
a speech impediment and has taken her
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
years to overcome that and so she's
 
04:49:03.310 --> 04:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
behind on reading but she's catching up
 
04:49:05.548 --> 04:49:05.558 align:start position:0%
but if she's taking a reading test by
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
state standards and she sees that she's
 
04:49:10.868 --> 04:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
behind she's going to feel defeated
 
04:49:13.230 --> 04:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
already and that's not fair to our
 
04:49:15.030 --> 04:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
students when we're we're waiting for
 
04:49:17.190 --> 04:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
them to catch up and we're learning and
 
04:49:19.750 --> 04:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
teaching them at their own
 
04:49:22.190 --> 04:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
pace um there is no language in this
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill that allows for difference is in
 
04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
any learning abilities as you can see I
 
04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
have a son with Down syndrome and how is
 
04:49:32.350 --> 04:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
he supposed to be able to adapt that
 
04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
without any kind of help
 
04:49:37.470 --> 04:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
or anything when there's no language to
 
04:49:40.670 --> 04:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
protect him it also set uh infringes on
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
our familiar rights as we choose to be
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
separate from the public school
 
04:49:48.548 --> 04:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
education for uh system this forces
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
families to participate in a system they
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
do not have a desire to be a part
 
04:49:55.510 --> 04:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
of even if it's just to receive a
 
04:49:57.628 --> 04:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
student ID number some of us are opposed
 
04:49:57.638 --> 04:49:58.390 align:start position:0%
student ID number some of us are opposed
to

04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
that the state does not
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
need the uh the pupil range our pupil's
 
04:50:06.750 --> 04:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
range of learning for homeschooled
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
children the data gathered from home
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
educated children cannot and should not
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
have an effect on improving Ed uh
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
instruction and learning for those
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
within the public school system your
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
your time is up oh wow that was quick it
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
goes by quickly so far any questions are
 
04:50:27.868 --> 04:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
there any questions no okay thank you I
 
04:50:29.470 --> 04:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
know that when I bring the grandkids
 
04:50:31.750 --> 04:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
down here at 5 years old they say look
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
papa there's the golden Castle and you
 
04:50:36.430 --> 04:50:36.440 align:start position:0%

04:50:43.390 --> 04:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.910 --> 04:50:47.920 align:start position:0%

04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
I juam okay and then Samantha
 
04:51:02.760 --> 04:51:05.788 align:start position:0%
I juam okay and then Samantha
Marbury

04:51:05.788 --> 04:51:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:08.110 --> 04:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
uh hello again Matt Southerton for
 
04:51:10.510 --> 04:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
children scholarship fund is is this on
 
04:51:14.030 --> 04:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
I can't tell um anyway so we oppose this
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
bill as written we we believe that
 
04:51:18.270 --> 04:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
current law is the right way to go it
 
04:51:20.190 --> 04:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
provides families and parents the most
 
04:51:22.910 --> 04:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility to choose the the the
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
different option or method that they
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
want to use to comply with the law that
 
04:51:28.990 --> 04:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
is best for them one of the unintended
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
consequences that I'm really worried
 
04:51:32.350 --> 04:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
about so as I've been in this position
 
04:51:34.270 --> 04:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
I've learned that a number of um
 
04:51:35.708 --> 04:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
families that have students with special
 
04:51:38.390 --> 04:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
needs actually prefer the portfolio
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation because they believe that
 
04:51:41.750 --> 04:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's just the way that they can best
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
measure growth for their students so
 
04:51:45.230 --> 04:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
that really would concern me if we
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
changed that um obviously current law
 
04:51:50.548 --> 04:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
provides the most flexibility and I do
 
04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
have some metrics if you're interested
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
in those from 2022 and
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
2023 uh 69% of the students in the EFA
 
04:52:04.350 --> 04:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
program chose a standardized test uh 30%
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the students in the EFA program uh
 
04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
met that obligation with the uh student
 
04:52:15.390 --> 04:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
portfolio so that roughly 1% of parents
 
04:52:18.390 --> 04:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
chose the Statewide assessment thank you
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
Matt do you have those metrics available
 
04:52:21.788 --> 04:52:21.798 align:start position:0%
for us I do I can I can email those to
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
the committee yes I appreciate it okay
 
04:52:26.510 --> 04:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
no yes representative Boni thank you Mr
 
04:52:32.110 --> 04:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:52:35.070 --> 04:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
question and responding to to my emails
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
giv the information um if if this if
 
04:52:41.470 --> 04:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
something was passed that affected uh
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
students receiving the EFA accounts um
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you already are
 
04:52:48.750 --> 04:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
collecting some information of students
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
that are taking standardized tests would
 
04:52:55.868 --> 04:52:55.878 align:start position:0%
it be would there be a a way to make
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
that information publicly
 
04:52:57.920 --> 04:52:59.470 align:start position:0%
that information publicly
available

04:52:59.470 --> 04:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay in terms of sheer number so we're
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're prohibited by law from sharing any
 
04:53:08.830 --> 04:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
P pii right pii so what we do when we
 
04:53:10.270 --> 04:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
when we send this information to the
 
04:53:12.350 --> 04:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education we're required
 
04:53:15.190 --> 04:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
to send them aggregated data so that's
 
04:53:16.590 --> 04:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
why I can give you yes I can give you
 
04:53:18.788 --> 04:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
the sheer numbers the the absolute
 
04:53:20.548 --> 04:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
numbers in each
 
04:53:23.070 --> 04:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
method okay so what you're saying is you
 
04:53:25.750 --> 04:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
can provide the aggregate information to
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education uh for the
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
testing data yes yes okay thank
 
04:53:34.150 --> 04:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
you aggregated numbers and correlated
 
04:53:35.628 --> 04:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
with the number of students that are in
 
04:53:38.670 --> 04:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
that aggregate correct okay represent
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair thank
 
04:53:43.788 --> 04:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr Southerton is that information
 
04:53:46.590 --> 04:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
being reported out um by the um
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
education department right
 
04:53:52.708 --> 04:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
now I I would not know that's just we
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
send them the
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
data I don't know if it's posted online
 
04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
or not all right and and and a followup
 
04:54:00.190 --> 04:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
so that's so that data has been sent to
 
04:54:03.270 --> 04:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
them for each of the that is that period
 
04:54:03.280 --> 04:54:04.070 align:start position:0%
them for each of the that is that period
so

04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
yeah that's my understanding and then um
 
04:54:08.270 --> 04:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
this year students will start to
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
re-qualify in July uh they'll have until
 
04:54:12.670 --> 04:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
July 15th to send us one of those three
 
04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
methods and then we'll have you know
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's always a year look back okay and
 
04:54:18.788 --> 04:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
final followup is there is there
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
anything in the in 194f that would um
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
prohibit the department from um
 
04:54:26.628 --> 04:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
publishing that data the same way they
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
do for public
 
04:54:30.628 --> 04:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
schools uh yeah I mean not that I'm
 
04:54:32.910 --> 04:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
aware of as long for an aggregate yeah
 
04:54:34.510 --> 04:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's I'm saying it's the same way in
 
04:54:36.270 --> 04:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
public schools so and I think again I
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
think that'll probably be one of the
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
pieces in our annual report that we're
 
04:54:40.310 --> 04:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to be you know we're going to
 
04:54:42.548 --> 04:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
create an annual report give a look back
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
at the um EFA program each year so that
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
if you do have data that we can share
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
with you please let us know uh you know
 
04:54:51.788 --> 04:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
if you find that helpful and we'll
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
include that in the board obviously
 
04:54:55.708 --> 04:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
thank thank you you're welcome any
 
04:54:58.390 --> 04:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr San thank you
 
04:55:01.390 --> 04:55:01.400 align:start position:0%

yeah um quickly I will pass from
 
04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
speaking seeing that all the points I
 
04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
was going to make today um time is
 
04:55:19.868 --> 04:55:19.878 align:start position:0%
ticking have been um brought forth
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
eloquently I strongly oppose uh the bill
 
04:55:25.150 --> 04:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
I think it the language is poorly
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
written and it would also affect
 
04:55:29.030 --> 04:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
homeschool Educators as well as EA
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%

I'm a homeschool mom of four from
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
wolfboro New Hampshire um I just want to
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
say I'm opposed to this bill I'm not
 
04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to continue on because everybody's
 
04:56:34.708 --> 04:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
pretty much covered everything that i'
 
04:56:38.190 --> 04:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
would like to say um I also have a
 
04:56:40.948 --> 04:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
letter that uh you guys should already
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
have that you can read uh with my
 
04:56:45.708 --> 04:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
opinions but I did just want to say that
 
04:56:48.990 --> 04:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
um you know if if everyone is looking at
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
us as how we're using tax fund you know
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
tax money uh taxpayer dollars I just
 
04:56:57.390 --> 04:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
think we should also be looking at the
 
04:56:59.788 --> 04:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
school systems to see you know if
 
04:57:01.310 --> 04:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
they're failing what is the consequence
 
04:57:04.750 --> 04:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
for that if if we're paying $20 ,000 per
 
04:57:07.548 --> 04:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
student annually where's that money
 
04:57:09.230 --> 04:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
going and what are the uh what are the
 
04:57:11.470 --> 04:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
benefits of that and so if everybody's
 
04:57:12.910 --> 04:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about what homeschoolers are
 
04:57:14.788 --> 04:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
doing I think maybe we should be looking
 
04:57:18.190 --> 04:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
at those big organizations first uh
 
04:57:19.990 --> 04:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
04:57:20.000 --> 04:57:20.708 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
any

04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:57:29.310 --> 04:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.070 --> 04:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
schmith hello hi my name is Megan
 
04:57:34.590 --> 04:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I'm a resident of conquered and
 
04:57:37.548 --> 04:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
I am a traditional homeschooler who does
 
04:57:40.470 --> 04:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
not receive any funding for doing so as
 
04:57:42.430 --> 04:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
it stands this bill would subject my
 
04:57:44.270 --> 04:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
four children to be forced into
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
standardized testing a method that I who
 
04:57:49.590 --> 04:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
arguably know my children best can tell
 
04:57:51.470 --> 04:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
you would not be an accurate example of
 
04:57:54.270 --> 04:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
the knowledge that they have this bill
 
04:57:56.830 --> 04:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
is poorly written redundant in many ways
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
due to RSA
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
193a and a violation of homeschoolers
 
04:58:03.270 --> 04:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
rights especially when many of us here
 
04:58:05.150 --> 04:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
today have left public schools for the
 
04:58:07.470 --> 04:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum or standardized tests so I
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
ask you to please vote itl on 1610 thank
 
04:58:13.708 --> 04:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from the
 
04:58:15.990 --> 04:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
waiting uh Jessica
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
blasic good afternoon thank you
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me the
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Jessica
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
Seaman I'm a resident of Dairy New
 
04:58:33.270 --> 04:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a homeschooling mom on under
 
04:58:35.948 --> 04:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
the RSA 193a traditional unfunded
 
04:58:38.350 --> 04:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and I also maintain my New
 
04:58:40.510 --> 04:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire teacher certification here in
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
the state I do that particularly so that
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
I can legally provide homeschool
 
04:58:47.310 --> 04:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
portfolio evaluations for homeschoolers
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
in our state these families have
 
04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
established a relationship with me over
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
several years so that we can evaluate
 
04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
their progress Year bye through the EB
 
04:58:58.150 --> 04:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
and flow of the programs curriculums and
 
04:59:00.510 --> 04:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
techniques that the parents are using to
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
address their students changing needs or
 
04:59:05.430 --> 04:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
Dynamic needs for throughout the years
 
04:59:07.390 --> 04:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
these evaluations are a rich discourse
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
between the parent and myself as we are
 
04:59:11.430 --> 04:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
looking over their portfolio and it
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
allows a deep understanding of the
 
04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
progress the student has made during
 
04:59:18.590 --> 04:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
that year I wholeheartedly believe that
 
04:59:20.628 --> 04:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
for some students that rich education
 
04:59:22.150 --> 04:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
that I see occurring in these very
 
04:59:24.670 --> 04:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
personalized educational Pathways might
 
04:59:27.190 --> 04:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
not be accurately reflected on a rigid
 
04:59:29.390 --> 04:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
standardized fill in the bubble test
 
04:59:31.350 --> 04:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's very concerning to me parents
 
04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
would have to put much of that beautiful
 
04:59:34.750 --> 04:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive education that they're
 
04:59:37.070 --> 04:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
doing aside in order to teach to the
 
04:59:38.590 --> 04:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
test just that their student would do
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
well on paper and that's a sad option
 
04:59:43.230 --> 04:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
this will be especially detrimental to
 
04:59:45.430 --> 04:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
students who have any level of test
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
anxiety throwing even a neurotypical
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
child into a completely unknown
 
04:59:52.110 --> 04:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
environment and asking them to perform
 
04:59:55.390 --> 04:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
very well in a test is is laughable at
 
04:59:58.150 --> 04:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
best and cruel at worst so much of
 
04:59:59.910 --> 04:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
current education pushes for
 
05:00:02.548 --> 05:00:02.558 align:start position:0%
individualization of instruction so why
 
05:00:03.628 --> 05:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
take away the freedom for
 
05:00:07.070 --> 05:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
individualization of evaluation as well
 
05:00:10.070 --> 05:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
hb610 also allows the parents of public
 
05:00:12.030 --> 05:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
school students to opt them out from
 
05:00:14.350 --> 05:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
this standardized testing format but
 
05:00:16.150 --> 05:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
that opt out is not afforded to the
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
other educational Pathways and that is
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
discriminatory I urge you to urge um itl
 
05:00:25.110 --> 05:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote itl on hb610 thank

nine years I am also an immigrant I am

indigenous I am Latina and I am an EFA
 
05:01:21.070 --> 05:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
educator as well the notion that our
 
05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
family is freeloading off of the state
 
05:01:26.110 --> 05:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
and not making sacrifices in order to
 
05:01:28.190 --> 05:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
accept state funding in order to offer
 
05:01:30.708 --> 05:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
our children resources for their
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
education is elitist and and frankly
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
insulting my family has sacrificed
 
05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
everything we have sacrificed our
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
country my culture my
 
05:01:43.990 --> 05:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
language family everything also that my
 
05:01:46.548 --> 05:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
children can have freedom and
 
05:01:48.670 --> 05:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities beyond what we have ever
 
05:01:53.708 --> 05:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
had I urge you to vote no on hb610 as an
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
EFA educator our family already
 
05:01:58.830 --> 05:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
participates in standardized testing and
 
05:02:01.150 --> 05:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
it is already uploaded to the portal
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
that is required per the existing
 
05:02:07.110 --> 05:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
requirements of receiving the EFA funds
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
I have three children with special needs
 
05:02:11.910 --> 05:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
one of them with a genetic disorder who
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
require significant amount of special
 
05:02:17.910 --> 05:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
education the EFA allows our children to
 
05:02:19.948 --> 05:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
have opportunities that would not be
 
05:02:22.350 --> 05:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
available to them otherwise such as
 
05:02:24.990 --> 05:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
speech therapy occupational therapy
 
05:02:27.750 --> 05:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
Aviation camps and other wonderful
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
resources that we have been able to do
 
05:02:32.708 --> 05:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
our children recently finished
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
standardized testing and for my one
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
child it took her 14 hours spread out
 
05:02:41.190 --> 05:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
for the last 3 days with me reading
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
every single question to her as you can
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
imagine this would be an unnecessary
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
burden to the public schools especially
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
to Salsbury Elementary School which is
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
the district that we are in that has 63
 
05:02:55.868 --> 05:02:55.878 align:start position:0%
students currently in addition of five
 
05:02:59.590 --> 05:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
more children is a 133% increase to them
 
05:03:02.830 --> 05:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
and a 300% increase in special education
 
05:03:06.190 --> 05:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
resources to them 14 hours for one child
 
05:03:08.670 --> 05:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
9 hours for the other and 8 hours for
 
05:03:11.470 --> 05:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
the other child of individual attention
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
my one child with a genetic disorder
 
05:03:16.430 --> 05:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
also has a medical condition and the
 
05:03:18.030 --> 05:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
individualized attention the
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
individualized requirements are required
 
05:03:24.910 --> 05:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
per her doctor per her psychologist per
 
05:03:27.350 --> 05:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
her psychiatrist so this is not
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
something that would be optional for the
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
school to provide it would be mandatory
 
05:03:33.868 --> 05:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would be discri
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote no thank you thank
 
05:03:38.910 --> 05:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
you very much any questions from the
 
05:03:41.830 --> 05:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee not see you thank you very
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
much uh Jamie Wilder uh Melissa blasic

and Kayla
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
look good afternoon good afternoon
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives my name is JMA Wilder
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
from campon New Hampshire I'm the mother
 
05:04:01.628 --> 05:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
of five children and have homeschooled
 
05:04:03.788 --> 05:04:03.798 align:start position:0%
my children and sent two of them to
 
05:04:05.470 --> 05:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brook line upper elementary
 
05:04:07.868 --> 05:04:07.878 align:start position:0%
middle school and high school I oppose
 
05:04:11.230 --> 05:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
hb610 the claim is that the bill will be
 
05:04:13.150 --> 05:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
used to identify a pupil's range of
 
05:04:15.310 --> 05:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
learning and yields objective data to
 
05:04:17.628 --> 05:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
use an improving instruction and
 
05:04:20.270 --> 05:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
learning it would be
 
05:04:22.990 --> 05:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
impossible to assess my children for
 
05:04:24.990 --> 05:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
improvements because besides English
 
05:04:27.510 --> 05:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
language arts reading and Mathematics my
 
05:04:29.628 --> 05:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
children are taught complex culinary
 
05:04:32.590 --> 05:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
arts Maple syruping beekeeping gardening
 
05:04:34.990 --> 05:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
starting from seeds building framing
 
05:04:38.510 --> 05:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
whittling mechanical drama music theory
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
personal finance just to list a few I am
 
05:04:43.548 --> 05:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
confident that my teaching surpasses the
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
level of learning of the public private
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
or charter schools that is why I
 
05:04:49.990 --> 05:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
homeschool if you were to test my
 
05:04:51.830 --> 05:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
children on Common Core math they would
 
05:04:54.548 --> 05:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
not recognize the ridiculous questions I
 
05:04:56.670 --> 05:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
would be confident for the most of the
 
05:04:59.190 --> 05:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
adults in this room that's also true we
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
live in a society where many teenagers
 
05:05:03.628 --> 05:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
can't count change back to you but will
 
05:05:05.548 --> 05:05:05.558 align:start position:0%
not acknowledge the harm this curriculum
 
05:05:08.350 --> 05:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
is causing my tax dollars go to the
 
05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
school district even though I receive no
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
financial support or resources from the
 
05:05:15.788 --> 05:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
district or state it appears that this
 
05:05:17.708 --> 05:05:17.718 align:start position:0%
bill is being used to keep money in the
 
05:05:19.350 --> 05:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
public schools instead of allowing
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
parents to choose what is best for their
 
05:05:23.868 --> 05:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
children I believe that this is a
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
gateway to control P private school
 
05:05:29.190 --> 05:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
school choice and home school curriculum
 
05:05:30.868 --> 05:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
when my children were in public school
 
05:05:33.390 --> 05:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
the testing scores had dropped over over
 
05:05:36.510 --> 05:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
onethird one year after covid the
 
05:05:39.070 --> 05:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent blamed the DNA
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
of the parents for the decline they
 
05:05:44.548 --> 05:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
refused to consider lockdowns mandates
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
and remote learning on the decline
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers did not have a loss of
 
05:05:51.788 --> 05:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
learning it is common knowledge that
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
teachers are required to teach to the
 
05:05:56.190 --> 05:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
test if you are concerned with the level
 
05:05:57.868 --> 05:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
of learning you should look into the
 
05:05:59.948 --> 05:05:59.958 align:start position:0%
consequences of the decisions made by
 
05:06:02.548 --> 05:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
the public school Educators over the
 
05:06:05.310 --> 05:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
last four years this bill is going to
 
05:06:07.708 --> 05:06:07.718 align:start position:0%
cost taxpayers Untold spending and will
 
05:06:10.110 --> 05:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
not improve education in the public
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
private school choice or homeschooling
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
homes your thank you very much good

rebuild NH uh rebuild opposes both the
 
05:06:52.270 --> 05:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
intent and the consequences of hb610 um
 
05:06:53.788 --> 05:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of testimony today
 
05:06:56.590 --> 05:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
about sort of the uh the all learning
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
environment so I'll I'll uh Focus my
 
05:07:01.510 --> 05:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
testimony on as it would apply to EFA
 
05:07:03.708 --> 05:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
students uh Reb has supported education
 
05:07:05.830 --> 05:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts as a means of giving
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
underprivileged children and families
 
05:07:09.788 --> 05:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
more educational options outside of the
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
public school system currently EFA
 
05:07:13.548 --> 05:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
students are required to submit an
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
end-year evaluation standardized test of
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
their choice or they can send their
 
05:07:20.030 --> 05:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
child to a registered and approved
 
05:07:22.270 --> 05:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
Private School uh standardized tests are
 
05:07:24.548 --> 05:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
meant to gauge the efficiency of the
 
05:07:26.750 --> 05:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum Public School curriculums are
 
05:07:28.628 --> 05:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
now based in common core and tests have
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
been modified to reflect that curriculum
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
we are all aware that teacher regularly
 
05:07:35.310 --> 05:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
teach to the test families who choose
 
05:07:37.390 --> 05:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
EFA as an option are looking for
 
05:07:39.350 --> 05:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
something different than what the public
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
schools are currently offering parents
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
who take their children out of public
 
05:07:45.070 --> 05:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
school should not be required to tailor
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
their curriculum or their private
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
schools curriculum to match what is
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
being taught in public schools while I
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
understand the desire for an objective
 
05:07:55.628 --> 05:07:55.638 align:start position:0%
standard to which to hold all taxpayer
 
05:07:57.948 --> 05:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
funded education I don't believe that
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
such a metric exists and in the absence
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
of such an objective metric I don't
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
believe it is fair to demand one set of
 
05:08:07.548 --> 05:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funded education have strings
 
05:08:09.150 --> 05:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
attached while public schools have no
 
05:08:11.110 --> 05:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
real Benchmark at which poor performance
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
loses funding thank you thank you very
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%

05:08:20.110 --> 05:08:20.120 align:start position:0%

great thank you members of the committee
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon my name is
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
Sarah schaer I'm from stod New Hampshire
 
05:09:04.110 --> 05:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today in opposition to
 
05:09:05.230 --> 05:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:09:07.548 --> 05:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
1610 I'd like to start just briefly by
 
05:09:08.990 --> 05:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
concurring with the many previous
 
05:09:10.750 --> 05:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
speakers that have shared the many flaws
 
05:09:13.708 --> 05:09:13.718 align:start position:0%
in this bill I agree that has very poor
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
broad sweeping language the execution
 
05:09:17.390 --> 05:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
and the attent are not very clear as it
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
stands written I do see this as a direct
 
05:09:22.110 --> 05:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
attack on parental rights and as it has
 
05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
been mentioned having students take a
 
05:09:25.310 --> 05:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
test that their specific curriculum has
 
05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
not prepared them for is not by any
 
05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
means a fair assessment of their
 
05:09:31.510 --> 05:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
education but what I would really like
 
05:09:33.150 --> 05:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
to share today today is my personal
 
05:09:35.628 --> 05:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
story because I'm a homeschool graduate
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
my parents um had me attend kindergarten
 
05:09:39.190 --> 05:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
in public and after that they decided
 
05:09:42.030 --> 05:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
they could do better and they did I had
 
05:09:45.628 --> 05:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
a very full Rich wonderful education I'm
 
05:09:48.070 --> 05:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
so thankful for the sacrifices they made
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
I received curriculum and education that
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
was personalized to me and to my
 
05:09:55.548 --> 05:09:55.558 align:start position:0%
strengths and to my weaknesses I'm quite
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
certain at some point I would have
 
05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
struggled with a standardized test but
 
05:10:01.270 --> 05:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
my parents weren't required to send me
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
to unfamiliar location to be
 
05:10:04.510 --> 05:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
administered a test that my curriculum
 
05:10:06.470 --> 05:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
didn't prepare me for and so when I
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
struggled they re-evaluated we made
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
adjustments tried a new curriculum until
 
05:10:14.548 --> 05:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
I had success again my home education
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
has served me very very well in life and
 
05:10:19.948 --> 05:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
more important than my experience
 
05:10:21.030 --> 05:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
because to be honest high school and
 
05:10:23.230 --> 05:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
college was a long time ago I'm here
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
today because now I'm a mother my
 
05:10:27.788 --> 05:10:27.798 align:start position:0%
husband and I have two very bright
 
05:10:29.470 --> 05:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
daughters four-year-old and almost

of individualized education for my girls
 
05:10:50.990 --> 05:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
my parents moved here in 2006 to find a
 
05:10:52.670 --> 05:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
state that would support the opportunity
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
for them to provide more educationally
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
to their children and I'm here today to
 
05:11:00.350 --> 05:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
ask you to uphold that state for me for
 
05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation for my children
 
05:11:04.750 --> 05:11:04.760 align:start position:0%

feel my education has made all the
 
05:11:54.070 --> 05:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
difference in my life instead of my
 
05:11:55.868 --> 05:11:55.878 align:start position:0%
education being focused on test
 
05:11:57.548 --> 05:11:57.558 align:start position:0%

individualized education with curriculum
 
05:12:03.470 --> 05:12:03.480 align:start position:0%

annual
 
05:12:12.510 --> 05:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
assessments I was given the opportunity
 
05:12:15.670 --> 05:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
to learn for the sake of learning for
 
05:12:19.470 --> 05:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
growth and personal development not
 
05:12:22.110 --> 05:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
pressure to perform on a

test I am here today to ask you to
 
05:12:26.830 --> 05:12:26.840 align:start position:0%

homeschooling family in
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
barington I have heard so many families
 
05:13:35.190 --> 05:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
speaking to the many reasons why this is
 
05:13:38.350 --> 05:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
a very very poorly written bill but I'm
 
05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
going to speak to the fiscal note for
 
05:13:41.470 --> 05:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
those that might not care about the
 
05:13:41.480 --> 05:13:42.590 align:start position:0%
those that might not care about the
personal

05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
personal
 
05:13:45.990 --> 05:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
stories representative cascaden promoted
 
05:13:50.230 --> 05:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
this bill as a way to track the progress
 
05:13:53.548 --> 05:13:53.558 align:start position:0%
of EFA students EFA students as you've
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
already heard from the CSF have to
 
05:13:59.628 --> 05:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
submit that progress to the CSF and it's
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
submitted to the state in an aggregate
 
05:14:01.040 --> 05:14:02.830 align:start position:0%
submitted to the state in an aggregate
form

05:14:02.830 --> 05:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
form
 
05:14:04.390 --> 05:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
this would require those students to
 
05:14:06.990 --> 05:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
submit to a second
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
test putting a burden on the district
 
05:14:12.990 --> 05:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
schools to administer it representative
 
05:14:17.230 --> 05:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
cascaden has spoken to say that the
 
05:14:19.910 --> 05:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
money is what she's worried about yet
 
05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
she's caused more spending in the
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
execution of it thank
 
05:14:28.070 --> 05:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
 
05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
committee when you said a couple of
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
graduated already Yes did they take the
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
SAT or no we did not participate in the
 
05:14:39.948 --> 05:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
SAT we do review of our work okay so my
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
next question is when you're applying to
 
05:14:44.510 --> 05:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
colleges do they ask for anything like
 
05:14:48.310 --> 05:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
that our oldest has not chosen to use uh
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
the college system at this time but as
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding to be that there are
 
05:14:57.510 --> 05:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
many uh well-received uh homeschooling
 
05:14:59.670 --> 05:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh applicants to many Nationwide
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
universities thank you thank you
 
05:15:05.948 --> 05:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
uh next one is
 
05:15:13.390 --> 05:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
Audrey Boden B bodden and Lydia o
 
05:15:19.270 --> 05:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:23.628 --> 05:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
Allen hello hi my name is Audrey Bowden
 
05:15:28.390 --> 05:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
and I am a resident of dairy I am a mom
 
05:15:31.628 --> 05:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
a small business owner and a student of
 
05:15:34.750 --> 05:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
political science I will graduate in May
 
05:15:39.788 --> 05:15:39.798 align:start position:0%
I'm currently an EFA homeschooling
 
05:15:43.190 --> 05:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
parent and a lot of what I have to say
 
05:15:47.150 --> 05:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
has already been pointed out to the
 
05:15:47.160 --> 05:15:48.670 align:start position:0%
has already been pointed out to the
committee

05:15:48.670 --> 05:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
but in efforts to with stain from being
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
an echo chamber I want to kind of point
 
05:15:57.310 --> 05:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
out some of the things that a few people
 
05:16:01.030 --> 05:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
before me have have touched upon but not
 
05:16:03.868 --> 05:16:03.878 align:start position:0%
really founded upon So currently there
 
05:16:07.190 --> 05:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
are stipulations for receiving the EFA
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
fund and a lot of those stipulations
 
05:16:13.070 --> 05:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
have to do with income so not all
 
05:16:15.670 --> 05:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
homeschooling parents qualify for this
 
05:16:19.830 --> 05:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
EFA fund they're I believe it's a cap of
 
05:16:22.548 --> 05:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
$75,000 per year you can correct me if
 
05:16:26.548 --> 05:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but each student is awarded
 
05:16:26.558 --> 05:16:27.948 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but each student is awarded
approximately

05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
$5,000 per year that's roughly
 
05:16:37.150 --> 05:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
25% of what the average cost of funding
 
05:16:42.430 --> 05:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
a pupil in the school system is and
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
so what your bill is proposing is that
 
05:16:49.548 --> 05:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
homeschooling students meet the same
 
05:16:53.910 --> 05:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
standards or prove that they are capable
 
05:16:56.990 --> 05:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
of reading and writing according
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
to their
 
05:17:02.030 --> 05:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
peers and so my
 
05:17:04.590 --> 05:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion for all of you is that if you
 
05:17:08.190 --> 05:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
want these homeschooling students to
 
05:17:10.830 --> 05:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
meet the same standards as publicly
 
05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
educated students then I would strongly
 
05:17:16.430 --> 05:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
suggest increasing the amount of money
 
05:17:18.628 --> 05:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
that these homeschooling parents are
 
05:17:22.310 --> 05:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
receiving to match the same level of
 
05:17:24.830 --> 05:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
Education that you're giving or the same
 
05:17:26.470 --> 05:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
cost that you're giving these publicly
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
funded students I also write um have
 
05:17:31.590 --> 05:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
written down here that to touch upon on
 
05:17:33.110 --> 05:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
what you were just discussing with the
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
person before me is that college
 
05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
colleges and
 
05:17:42.990 --> 05:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
um some of the top tier higher education
 
05:17:45.070 --> 05:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
institutions like Harvard are actually
 
05:17:47.948 --> 05:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
moving away from accepting standardized
 
05:17:51.230 --> 05:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
testing including the SAT and the act
 
05:17:54.230 --> 05:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so what we're seeing is public
 
05:17:55.948 --> 05:17:55.958 align:start position:0%
outcry from
 
05:17:58.670 --> 05:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
Educators from all different levels not
 
05:18:01.590 --> 05:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
just Elementary Middle High School but
 
05:18:03.910 --> 05:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
College as well that standardized
 
05:18:06.670 --> 05:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
testing is actually
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
becoming kind of useless your your time
 
05:18:11.548 --> 05:18:11.558 align:start position:0%
is up perfect thank you so much thank
 
05:18:14.270 --> 05:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
you very much for
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%

law school right now as well my oldest
 
05:18:43.390 --> 05:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
two have already graduated high school
 
05:18:46.230 --> 05:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
one is uh continuing her education at
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
Boston architectural College my other is
 
05:18:51.390 --> 05:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
heading out to Africa to do humanitarian
 
05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
work I have two more in homeschool high
 
05:18:57.310 --> 05:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
school right now and uh they're finding
 
05:18:58.628 --> 05:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
out who they are and what they want to
 
05:19:01.708 --> 05:19:01.718 align:start position:0%
be and it's it's an exciting process um
 
05:19:04.350 --> 05:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm in school too and so it's this
 
05:19:06.030 --> 05:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
journey that we see in homeschooling
 
05:19:08.230 --> 05:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
that education never ends learning that
 
05:19:10.708 --> 05:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
was the goal when my husband and I went
 
05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
into uh homeschooling was we wanted our
 
05:19:14.990 --> 05:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
kids to love learning and see it as a
 
05:19:17.910 --> 05:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
forever thing it's exciting to learn
 
05:19:20.350 --> 05:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
what people shared today there's so many
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
of the points that I agree with
 
05:19:23.350 --> 05:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
thoroughly there's one thing that I want
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
to point to just in particular for you
 
05:19:28.230 --> 05:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
all um and it was touched on by somebody
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
much earlier they they pointed out um um
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
the the case law between Pierce and
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
versus the Society of sisters that um
 
05:19:39.990 --> 05:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
was determined by the Supreme Court back
 
05:19:43.548 --> 05:19:43.558 align:start position:0%
in 1925 and I want she read one sentence
 
05:19:45.430 --> 05:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
from it I want to read the paragraph
 
05:19:48.150 --> 05:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
because I think it encompasses much that
 
05:19:50.350 --> 05:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
pertains to what is being discussed
 
05:19:52.948 --> 05:19:52.958 align:start position:0%
today um under the doctrine of Meer
 
05:19:55.948 --> 05:19:55.958 align:start position:0%
versus Nebraska this was a the opinion
 
05:19:58.110 --> 05:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
given by Justice MC Reynolds under the
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
doctrine of Meyer versus Nebraska we
 
05:20:02.030 --> 05:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
think it entirely PL
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
that the act of 1922 unreasonably
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
interferes with the liberty of parents
 
05:20:08.030 --> 05:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
and Guardians to direct the upbringing
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
and education of children under their
 
05:20:12.110 --> 05:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
control as often here to pointed out
 
05:20:15.070 --> 05:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
rights guaranteed by the Constitution
 
05:20:17.310 --> 05:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
may not be Abridged by legislation which
 
05:20:19.708 --> 05:20:19.718 align:start position:0%
has no reasonable relation to some
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
purpose within the competency competency
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
of the state the fundamental theory of
 
05:20:26.750 --> 05:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
Liberty upon which all governments in
 
05:20:30.030 --> 05:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
this Union Repose excludes any G general
 
05:20:32.430 --> 05:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
power of the state to standardize its
 
05:20:34.590 --> 05:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
children by forcing them to accept
 
05:20:36.868 --> 05:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
instruction from public teachers only
 
05:20:38.430 --> 05:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
the child is not the mere creature of
 
05:20:39.990 --> 05:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
the state those who nurture him and
 
05:20:42.670 --> 05:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
direct his Destiny have the right
 
05:20:44.670 --> 05:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
coupled with a high duty to recognize
 
05:20:46.990 --> 05:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
and prepare him for additional
 
05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
obligations that being coupled with the
 
05:20:51.150 --> 05:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
information that the standardized test
 
05:20:53.350 --> 05:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
has not been effective it is not being
 
05:20:55.750 --> 05:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
effective it is being thrown out in many
 
05:20:58.070 --> 05:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
places it does not appear to be a
 
05:21:00.430 --> 05:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable form of standardization for
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
the competent of children in our state
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that we would find some
 
05:21:05.670 --> 05:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
legal issues if we were to pursue with
 
05:21:08.270 --> 05:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much thank you are
 
05:21:10.590 --> 05:21:10.600 align:start position:0%

students the last two speakers kind of
 
05:21:50.788 --> 05:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
stole a little bit of my thunder uh but
 
05:21:51.910 --> 05:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh I want
 
05:21:55.230 --> 05:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
to relate to you I have multiple college
 
05:21:58.788 --> 05:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
degrees for two decades I've worked in a
 
05:22:01.310 --> 05:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
learning and education environment uh
 
05:22:03.510 --> 05:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
some as an educator but for the last
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
nine supporting graduate level education
 
05:22:09.390 --> 05:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
at a global top 30 University public top
 
05:22:13.390 --> 05:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
five University and during that time I
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
have witnessed the
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
devaluing of standardized assessments
 
05:22:23.150 --> 05:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
for college admittance and use both
 
05:22:25.708 --> 05:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
undergraduate and for gradu even the
 
05:22:27.868 --> 05:22:27.878 align:start position:0%
specific exams like the lsats and the
 
05:22:29.788 --> 05:22:29.798 align:start position:0%
mcats and stuff like that they've been
 
05:22:31.948 --> 05:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
devaluing those
 
05:22:37.350 --> 05:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
also uh I want I relate that to you to
 
05:22:40.590 --> 05:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrate my passion and understanding
 
05:22:43.948 --> 05:22:43.958 align:start position:0%
the value of Education now I do choose
 
05:22:47.030 --> 05:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
for our own homeschool assessments to do
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
standardized testing for specific couple
 
05:22:52.910 --> 05:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I can pick the test to best fit
 
05:22:56.830 --> 05:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
our uh curriculum second I can make that
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
test as less or as distressful as
 
05:23:01.510 --> 05:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
possible for my
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
children with placing them in a highly
 
05:23:06.030 --> 05:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
stressed environment when they haven't
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
been in a public school where the days
 
05:23:11.990 --> 05:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
are chosen does not allow them the best
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
situation for me to assess where they
 
05:23:16.430 --> 05:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
might have weaknesses so that I can
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
alter the curriculum the following year
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
and while I do not accept EFA money and
 
05:23:26.270 --> 05:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
will not my opinion here and that
 
05:23:28.430 --> 05:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
benefit that I get a choosey assessment
 
05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
when I can uh give it would apply EFA
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
parents as well they can make sure that
 
05:23:36.670 --> 05:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
the assessment they provide is done in a
 
05:23:39.230 --> 05:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
way that gets the most useful assessment
 
05:23:41.110 --> 05:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
information to the parent it's not going
 
05:23:44.070 --> 05:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
to be of any use to the public schools
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're not the Educators we are for our
 
05:23:47.548 --> 05:23:47.558 align:start position:0%
children thank
 
05:23:49.948 --> 05:23:49.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much are there any
 
05:23:51.670 --> 05:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:23:54.670 --> 05:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
you Kathy uh
 
05:24:01.150 --> 05:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
Baker yes hello I'm Kathy Baker I'm a
 
05:24:04.030 --> 05:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
homeschool mom
 
05:24:07.070 --> 05:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that um is very
 
05:24:10.350 --> 05:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
clear to me is that um we already have
 
05:24:11.948 --> 05:24:11.958 align:start position:0%
under our current
 
05:24:15.070 --> 05:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
rsas accountability through various
 
05:24:18.310 --> 05:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
means of evaluation for all four classes
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
of students in our states both types of
 
05:24:23.390 --> 05:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers private schools and public
 
05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
including public charter schools and so
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
I wonder because I know that the
 
05:24:31.390 --> 05:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill know that this is
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
not news to them so I wonder why they
 
05:24:37.708 --> 05:24:37.718 align:start position:0%
put forth this bill they put forth today
 
05:24:40.708 --> 05:24:40.718 align:start position:0%
and I can only assume that the purpose
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to destroy diversity and
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
educational choice you have already
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
heard from many parents talking about
 
05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
the issues of teaching to the test and
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
that homeschoolers and not mentioned but
 
05:24:56.430 --> 05:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
private schools and Charter Schools all
 
05:24:58.788 --> 05:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
offer their own curriculums which are
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the same as public
 
05:25:03.990 --> 05:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
school um
 
05:25:07.788 --> 05:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
and if you are forcing all of these
 
05:25:10.110 --> 05:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
institutions and every student in the
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
state to be evaluated on the public
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
school curriculum You Are by virtue
 
05:25:19.548 --> 05:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
destroying diversity in curriculums and
 
05:25:22.590 --> 05:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
tailoring of curriculums to individual
 
05:25:25.390 --> 05:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
children and I'm thinking perhaps
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's a threat felt by the moneyed
 
05:25:31.670 --> 05:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
interests in the schools um for example
 
05:25:33.708 --> 05:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
um as our state education commissioner
 
05:25:36.470 --> 05:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we now have 32 public
 
05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
charter schools in the state each of
 
05:25:42.110 --> 05:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
them serving a different mission for
 
05:25:45.430 --> 05:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
more than 5,500 students
 
05:25:48.390 --> 05:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide um instructing based on
 
05:25:52.390 --> 05:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
students unique needs this enhances
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
education for the individual students
 
05:25:57.150 --> 05:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
across the state and this is what our
 
05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
state education committee here as well
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
as all our state reps and people in the
 
05:26:05.910 --> 05:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
state should want but the moneyed
 
05:26:07.708 --> 05:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
interests probably don't like that there
 
05:26:11.470 --> 05:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
are 55,000 people in public Charters
 
05:26:13.670 --> 05:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
which are under a different umbrella
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
they probably don't like and in fact I
 
05:26:18.510 --> 05:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
believe there's been a direct attack in
 
05:26:22.430 --> 05:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
this bill on the EFA program I don't
 
05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
participate in the EFA program but they
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
are already evaluated they already have
 
05:26:30.110 --> 05:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
an RSA that has a structure for
 
05:26:32.628 --> 05:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
supervision and accountability and again
 
05:26:36.948 --> 05:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill know that but
 
05:26:39.150 --> 05:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
gosh if we start providing people money
 
05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
to choose this private school or this
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
charter school or extra help for
 
05:26:45.708 --> 05:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
homeschooling when you know we might
 
05:26:48.430 --> 05:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
have a working that needs to be home
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
people feel threatened and that's what
 
05:26:52.628 --> 05:26:52.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is an attack on and I ask you
 
05:26:56.230 --> 05:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
to um ditch it with your inexpedient to
 
05:26:58.510 --> 05:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
05:27:01.110 --> 05:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
the committee oh I'm
 
05:27:03.590 --> 05:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Carolyn
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
Mayer good afternoon thank you house
 
05:27:19.390 --> 05:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the education
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Carolyn Hawkins
 
05:27:25.070 --> 05:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm from Milford New Hampshire and uh I
 
05:27:27.470 --> 05:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
was public educated and I went to
 
05:27:29.190 --> 05:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
Virginia Tech for my bachelor's in
 
05:27:31.868 --> 05:27:31.878 align:start position:0%
horiculture and and I'm familiar with
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
standardized testing it was not my
 
05:27:36.270 --> 05:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
favorite growing up but I had to learn
 
05:27:41.070 --> 05:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
to master that um I am a wife of 26
 
05:27:43.708 --> 05:27:43.718 align:start position:0%
years to a veteran and a mother of four
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
children two of whom have graduated from
 
05:27:49.910 --> 05:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
our homeschooling of 17 years um we
 
05:27:52.150 --> 05:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
began homeschooling in Pensacola Florida
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
so Florida law was our first
 
05:27:56.270 --> 05:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
introduction we were required annual
 
05:27:58.390 --> 05:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
testing we had a a homeschool umbrella
 
05:28:00.788 --> 05:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
Co-op that we did the Iowa Test which
 
05:28:02.910 --> 05:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
covered a lot more than just reading
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
math and language um so having that
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
first picture of it um we moved to New
 
05:28:10.590 --> 05:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was 10 years ago now so I was
 
05:28:14.750 --> 05:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
thankful for the freedoms that we had um
 
05:28:17.750 --> 05:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
to choose is an assessment better
 
05:28:21.750 --> 05:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation I've kept portfolios I have
 
05:28:24.470 --> 05:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
so many portable containers of my
 
05:28:28.830 --> 05:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
schools My Children's School uh work um
 
05:28:30.510 --> 05:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
my two that have graduated high High
 
05:28:31.910 --> 05:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
School dual enrolled at Nashville
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
Community College um I had to keep a
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
transcript for them and then when they
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
graduated from the state as you all know
 
05:28:40.590 --> 05:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that they have
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
completed the required um education and
 
05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
all of the different things so I am
 
05:28:50.590 --> 05:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded um traditional I guess we've
 
05:28:52.590 --> 05:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
lived on a shoestring budget for many
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
years under one income um but our goal
 
05:28:58.150 --> 05:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
was not to teach our children for
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
testing understand the value of of some
 
05:29:03.430 --> 05:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
of those testings it's helped me when my
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
children have needed more time in some
 
05:29:07.788 --> 05:29:07.798 align:start position:0%
of the subjects so I have a full
 
05:29:12.510 --> 05:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.070 --> 05:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
um I think the one thing with the um EAS
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
is there's already things in place so
 
05:29:22.070 --> 05:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
when I heard about this just this
 
05:29:25.070 --> 05:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
morning I I drove up from Milford and I
 
05:29:27.190 --> 05:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
said you know we we have freedoms we
 
05:29:29.548 --> 05:29:29.558 align:start position:0%
have laws in place and I think we should
 
05:29:32.350 --> 05:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
oppose this House Bill 1610 because we
 
05:29:35.230 --> 05:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
already have laws that regulate what
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're required as homeschool parents to
 
05:29:39.270 --> 05:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
do and I think for this next Generation
 
05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
coming to have that freedom especially
 
05:29:44.350 --> 05:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
with all the testimony today for those
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
who have special need children or you
 
05:29:48.750 --> 05:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
know our children need to get outside
 
05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's so much learning outside your
 
05:29:52.750 --> 05:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
time is up now thank you so much I
 
05:29:54.350 --> 05:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate it Virginia Tech has a good
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
basketball team this year too yes they
 
05:29:58.868 --> 05:29:58.878 align:start position:0%
do yes they do go
 
05:30:05.070 --> 05:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:08.470 --> 05:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
re good afternoon good afternoon my name
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
is Nicole Lee and I live in Broadford
 
05:30:12.868 --> 05:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are an unfunded
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
traditional homeschooling family and I
 
05:30:19.350 --> 05:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
oppose house bills 1610 we actually
 
05:30:21.070 --> 05:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
don't meet the requirements to get
 
05:30:23.548 --> 05:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
funding otherwise we would because we
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
are always over budget with our
 
05:30:29.190 --> 05:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
homeschooling um and we did try public
 
05:30:32.430 --> 05:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
schooling in the year 2021 2022 my
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
oldest attended a public preschool um
 
05:30:38.470 --> 05:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
and we did decide to withdraw him from
 
05:30:40.910 --> 05:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
the kindergarten registration because
 
05:30:42.910 --> 05:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
many different circumstances that arise
 
05:30:45.310 --> 05:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
during the year including bullying
 
05:30:48.070 --> 05:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
anxiety and just overall negative
 
05:30:50.150 --> 05:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
behavioral changes that we saw within
 
05:30:53.788 --> 05:30:53.798 align:start position:0%
him um we opposed the bill for all of
 
05:30:56.030 --> 05:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
the same reasons we've seen come up here
 
05:30:58.430 --> 05:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
so I won't go through everything but I
 
05:31:01.310 --> 05:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
will say that I was publicly educated in
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
the State of Florida and um I was never
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
a great test taker it
 
05:31:10.310 --> 05:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually did not enhance anything that I
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
had ever learned and honestly I
 
05:31:15.990 --> 05:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
literally studied to pass a test and not
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
to actually learn and as I have been
 
05:31:20.510 --> 05:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
teaching my own children I'm actually
 
05:31:23.270 --> 05:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
more excited now to learn the subjects
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
that I kind of didn't we just skimmed
 
05:31:28.270 --> 05:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
through them so that I could pass a test
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
um so that really sticks out in my mind
 
05:31:34.590 --> 05:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
that I already know how my kids tests
 
05:31:37.470 --> 05:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
take and it's not great because we do
 
05:31:40.430 --> 05:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
assess them ourselves um so I am asking
 
05:31:44.190 --> 05:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
you to please oppose House Bill 1610 and
 
05:31:46.910 --> 05:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
add this to the testimonies today thank
 
05:31:49.628 --> 05:31:49.638 align:start position:0%
you questions are from the
 
05:31:53.350 --> 05:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much uh Sarah
 
05:31:53.360 --> 05:31:56.390 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much uh Sarah
Sarah

05:31:56.390 --> 05:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:06.670 --> 05:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:09.230 --> 05:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I am Sarah may I live in
 
05:32:11.470 --> 05:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
Anum New Hampshire this is my son Ron
 
05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
who is with me in solidarity opposing
 
05:32:16.670 --> 05:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
this bill he does not have a prepared
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
statement uh I'm the mother of six
 
05:32:23.150 --> 05:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
children two of them are EFA students we
 
05:32:25.510 --> 05:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
had to terminate our home education
 
05:32:27.430 --> 05:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
program in order to enroll them in the
 
05:32:30.190 --> 05:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
fa which we use to send them to a a
 
05:32:32.830 --> 05:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
private school in our town that was the
 
05:32:35.310 --> 05:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
best choice that we made as parents for
 
05:32:37.548 --> 05:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
the education of our two high schoolers
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
it has worked out wonderfully now I
 
05:32:42.948 --> 05:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
understand that some standardized
 
05:32:46.150 --> 05:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
testing is part and parcel of accepting
 
05:32:49.548 --> 05:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
State funds I think it's foolish but it
 
05:32:51.990 --> 05:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
is what it is and they are already
 
05:32:55.070 --> 05:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
participating in some standardized
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
testing that is being reported I got the
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
test scores um after they participated
 
05:33:03.910 --> 05:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
in those tests at the school I have in
 
05:33:07.110 --> 05:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
the past used the California achievement
 
05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
test as my endof year evaluation for my
 
05:33:13.548 --> 05:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
other four homeschooled students which
 
05:33:16.708 --> 05:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
are traditional and unfunded and I have
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
seen both uh the demoralizing effects on
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
my children who look at test questions
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
and burst into tears because they don't
 
05:33:30.110 --> 05:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
know how to answer them I think and also
 
05:33:31.230 --> 05:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
I have
 
05:33:35.190 --> 05:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
seen how any kind of time enforcement on
 
05:33:39.190 --> 05:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
those tests is just not helpful I
 
05:33:42.270 --> 05:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
have uh mostly used portfolio
 
05:33:43.628 --> 05:33:43.638 align:start position:0%
evaluations for our home education
 
05:33:45.990 --> 05:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
program and has turned out so much
 
05:33:48.708 --> 05:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
better um this is a deviation from my
 
05:33:50.590 --> 05:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
written prepared statement as all of the
 
05:33:52.670 --> 05:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
other reasons why I oppose this bill
 
05:33:55.788 --> 05:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
have been addressed but I did want to
 
05:33:59.430 --> 05:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
mention that no standardized testing is
 
05:34:02.110 --> 05:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
going to to reflect the learning that my
 
05:34:06.030 --> 05:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
children have today in coming coming to
 
05:34:06.040 --> 05:34:07.470 align:start position:0%
children have today in coming coming to
this

05:34:07.470 --> 05:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:34:12.070 --> 05:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
hearing they also do not reflect the
 
05:34:14.670 --> 05:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
amount of time that we put into in our

self-control and the Golden Rule these
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
things are not going to be reflected on
 
05:34:34.590 --> 05:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
whether they know that helium is a noble
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%

05:35:08.830 --> 05:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
pixler um good afternoon members of the
 
05:35:10.910 --> 05:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for taking my
 
05:35:13.430 --> 05:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
testimony um my name is Amar Banfield
 
05:35:14.990 --> 05:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a parental rights advocate in New
 
05:35:18.230 --> 05:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire focused on education uh I do
 
05:35:20.708 --> 05:35:20.718 align:start position:0%
support in terms of the transparency
 
05:35:22.590 --> 05:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
that you are seeking I think that that's
 
05:35:24.628 --> 05:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
important and I and I would support
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
something like that I cannot support uh
 
05:35:30.788 --> 05:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
the bill as written I cannot support for
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
standardized testing of the state
 
05:35:35.948 --> 05:35:35.958 align:start position:0%
standardized test on EFA students on
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
homeschool students on students in
 
05:35:42.110 --> 05:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
private schools on anybody including
 
05:35:44.470 --> 05:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
students in public schools this test is
 
05:35:46.590 --> 05:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
seriously flawed I'm happy to expand on
 
05:35:48.150 --> 05:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
that if I run out of time feel free to
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
ask me um but we have a seriously
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
followed test to begin with so forcing
 
05:35:55.310 --> 05:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
this on any child any
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
school um I think is is is
 
05:35:58.680 --> 05:36:01.310 align:start position:0%
school um I think is is is
counterproductive

05:36:01.310 --> 05:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
counterproductive
 
05:36:04.310 --> 05:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
um first of all the time that is that
 
05:36:06.470 --> 05:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
you would have to invest because they're
 
05:36:08.230 --> 05:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
already required to take the test so a
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
private school is going to already give
 
05:36:12.030 --> 05:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
them their test that they that they
 
05:36:14.350 --> 05:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
choose so now you're going to add many
 
05:36:16.788 --> 05:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
many hours of a student having to take
 
05:36:19.230 --> 05:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
another test that's a big
 
05:36:19.240 --> 05:36:22.190 align:start position:0%
another test that's a big
problem

05:36:22.190 --> 05:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
um fair test.org is a great source uh
 
05:36:29.190 --> 05:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative lad you looking for um uh
 
05:36:31.510 --> 05:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
schools colleges that don't take the SAT
 
05:36:34.150 --> 05:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
fair test.org I think it's was up to 800
 
05:36:36.310 --> 05:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
colleges in universities don't even look
 
05:36:39.190 --> 05:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
at the SAT I know that um St anoms does
 
05:36:42.350 --> 05:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
not um I cannot support the amendment
 
05:36:44.948 --> 05:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
again because even though it might pull
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
some of these students out it doesn't
 
05:36:49.270 --> 05:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
pull them all out and if my child were
 
05:36:51.070 --> 05:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
in a public school I would refuse this
 
05:36:53.670 --> 05:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
test but I as I have recommended to
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
other public school students because it
 
05:36:58.708 --> 05:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
is so flawed and then I would I I
 
05:37:01.510 --> 05:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
normally uh recommend that they take
 
05:37:03.548 --> 05:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
another maybe like a classical
 
05:37:05.190 --> 05:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
achievement test which is quite
 
05:37:07.030 --> 05:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
different um I don't know if you knew
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
this but when No Child Left Behind was
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh Sunset it and then we U moved to Essa
 
05:37:16.350 --> 05:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
Essa also included in change the
 
05:37:18.310 --> 05:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
accountability so accountability was not
 
05:37:20.430 --> 05:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
just your standardized test it is now
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
also uh grading skills so I can go to
 
05:37:25.110 --> 05:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
the standards and I can read the
 
05:37:26.830 --> 05:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
standards that'll be tested but I don't
 
05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
see anything public on skills so asking
 
05:37:33.150 --> 05:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
these schools to administer a test that
 
05:37:34.910 --> 05:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
they don't even know what skills are
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
05:37:38.548 --> 05:37:38.558 align:start position:0%
tested doesn't set you up for Success
 
05:37:40.868 --> 05:37:40.878 align:start position:0%
your time is up okay yeah yeah I think
 
05:37:42.868 --> 05:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
that our kids are set up for failure
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
taking this test in any school
 
05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
environment thank you are there any
 
05:37:47.590 --> 05:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
committee not see any thank you very
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%

Moran I guess good afternoon my name is
 
05:38:23.868 --> 05:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
Amber fixler I'm a constituent from
 
05:38:25.590 --> 05:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
Epsom New Hampshire we have been
 
05:38:27.548 --> 05:38:27.558 align:start position:0%
homeschooling our three children for the
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
entirety of their education we are
 
05:38:31.830 --> 05:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
traditional unfunded homeschooling
 
05:38:34.468 --> 05:38:34.478 align:start position:0%
family I've already sent my testimony
 
05:38:36.830 --> 05:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
through email to all of you I stand in
 
05:38:39.468 --> 05:38:39.478 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 1610 because of the
 
05:38:41.350 --> 05:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
need to test all students in the state
 
05:38:42.910 --> 05:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
including home education students
 
05:38:44.590 --> 05:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
according to the language of the
 
05:38:47.150 --> 05:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
bill um one of the reasons that I oppose
 
05:38:49.708 --> 05:38:49.718 align:start position:0%
this is that home educated students like
 
05:38:52.270 --> 05:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves are already required to
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
complete an annual evaluation which we
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
happily do um I recognize the state may
 
05:38:59.070 --> 05:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
need to evaluate its public education
 
05:38:59.080 --> 05:39:00.150 align:start position:0%
need to evaluate its public education
system

05:39:00.150 --> 05:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:39:02.230 --> 05:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
through portfolios or evaluations or
 
05:39:05.110 --> 05:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
standardized testing um and even to
 
05:39:07.030 --> 05:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
provide documentation of EFA students
 
05:39:09.590 --> 05:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
progress however um the data collected
 
05:39:11.350 --> 05:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
on home educated students in that
 
05:39:14.590 --> 05:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
category isn't going to have any um any
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
meaning for someone analyzing that
 
05:39:19.948 --> 05:39:19.958 align:start position:0%
data another reason I oppose this bill
 
05:39:21.468 --> 05:39:21.478 align:start position:0%
is that it is increasing regulatory
 
05:39:22.948 --> 05:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
requirements on homeschooling families
 
05:39:25.788 --> 05:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
and students in general um people are
 
05:39:28.310 --> 05:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
able to find folks with similar values
 
05:39:29.788 --> 05:39:29.798 align:start position:0%
um and I can attest that the local
 
05:39:32.230 --> 05:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
in-person homeschooling networks and
 
05:39:33.788 --> 05:39:33.798 align:start position:0%
online homeschooling networks that are
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
nationwide are U robust and I see that a
 
05:39:38.070 --> 05:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
lot of homeschooling families wishing to
 
05:39:40.430 --> 05:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
relocate consider New Hampshire for many
 
05:39:42.070 --> 05:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
really great reasons my husband and I
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
are both longtime lifelong residents of
 
05:39:46.628 --> 05:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um he's a veteran of a
 
05:39:48.548 --> 05:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
local National Guard unit we both have
 
05:39:50.270 --> 05:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
Bachelor degrees from New Hampshire
 
05:39:52.590 --> 05:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
colleges so we love New Hampshire
 
05:39:55.548 --> 05:39:55.558 align:start position:0%
however um it's considered moderate for
 
05:39:58.270 --> 05:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
its homeschooling regulations only New
 
05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
York Connecticut Pennsylvania and
 
05:40:02.350 --> 05:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts are more highly regulated
 
05:40:04.350 --> 05:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire for homeschooling
 
05:40:06.510 --> 05:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
laws um I don't want to see New
 
05:40:08.110 --> 05:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire become the most strictly
 
05:40:10.948 --> 05:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
regulated state for homeschooling in New
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um another reason that I
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill is that it allows for
 
05:40:16.708 --> 05:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
public schooling families to exempt
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
their students from this testing however
 
05:40:20.990 --> 05:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
that same exemption privilege is not
 
05:40:22.628 --> 05:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
given to other types of
 
05:40:24.868 --> 05:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
students um it is my personal belief
 
05:40:26.548 --> 05:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire overall will benefit
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
from encouraging families to live and
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
work here by improving the schools by
 
05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
decreasing regulations that apply to
 
05:40:35.150 --> 05:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers and students in general in
 
05:40:38.030 --> 05:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
our great lier die State increasing
 
05:40:40.270 --> 05:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
educational freedom and maybe even
 
05:40:41.830 --> 05:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
increasing homeschooling family numbers
 
05:40:43.390 --> 05:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is going to benefit our
 
05:40:45.510 --> 05:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
local communities your time is up and
 
05:40:47.468 --> 05:40:47.478 align:start position:0%
our state thank you thank you very much
 
05:40:50.590 --> 05:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee not see
 
05:40:56.310 --> 05:40:56.320 align:start position:0%

05:41:12.990 --> 05:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
know well Zer blower didn't do a good
 
05:41:14.830 --> 05:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
job here
 
05:41:17.628 --> 05:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
um William
 
05:41:19.628 --> 05:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
McKenzie go ahead thank you for the
 
05:41:22.110 --> 05:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I am an independent
 
05:41:23.990 --> 05:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooling mother from wolfboro New
 
05:41:27.150 --> 05:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um much of much of my personal
 
05:41:28.990 --> 05:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
testimony has been touched on already
 
05:41:30.350 --> 05:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
but but just a couple of things that I
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
would like to say is that ideally an
 
05:41:34.910 --> 05:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
assessment's purpose is to act as a tool
 
05:41:36.750 --> 05:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
for educators to show their students
 
05:41:39.390 --> 05:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
growth proficiency and reveal areas in
 
05:41:41.670 --> 05:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
which a student may need more support
 
05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
the reality is that in public schools
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
EST State assessments are also an
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
accountability measure to ensure
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars are being used
 
05:41:49.948 --> 05:41:49.958 align:start position:0%
effectively toward the educational
 
05:41:52.150 --> 05:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
growth of the children whose families
 
05:41:53.868 --> 05:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
have chosen to enroll their kids in that
 
05:41:56.990 --> 05:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
educational path the state the T state
 
05:41:58.548 --> 05:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
test designed for the educational
 
05:42:00.628 --> 05:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
approach chose for use in public schools
 
05:42:02.750 --> 05:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
would never be able to act as an
 
05:42:04.548 --> 05:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
accurate measure for children across a
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
very broad academic landscape including
 
05:42:08.750 --> 05:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
privately schooled independently
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooled or those along one of the
 
05:42:13.390 --> 05:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
variety of paths afforded uh to families
 
05:42:15.110 --> 05:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
who use education Freedom accounts to
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
fund their child's education uh finally
 
05:42:20.670 --> 05:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
in our school district despite a 90%
 
05:42:22.990 --> 05:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
graduation rate and according to the
 
05:42:26.590 --> 05:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
state standardized test scores only 36%
 
05:42:28.230 --> 05:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
of high school students test scores
 
05:42:31.350 --> 05:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
reveal Prof efficiency in math and 50%
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
of middle schoolers test scores
 
05:42:35.150 --> 05:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
reflected a proficient reading level as
 
05:42:37.230 --> 05:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer and a parent who cares very
 
05:42:39.270 --> 05:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
much about the education of the children
 
05:42:41.310 --> 05:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
in our state I would much rather see the
 
05:42:43.510 --> 05:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
budget recommended for this bill around
 
05:42:46.830 --> 05:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
2.5 million annual public tax dollars go
 
05:42:49.070 --> 05:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
toward improving academic rigor within
 
05:42:51.230 --> 05:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
the public school system in order to do
 
05:42:52.750 --> 05:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
what is best by the families who have
 
05:42:54.110 --> 05:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
enrolled their children in that
 
05:42:56.830 --> 05:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
educational path thank you very much
 
05:42:58.510 --> 05:42:58.520 align:start position:0%

05:43:17.280 --> 05:43:18.788 align:start position:0%
 
am

05:43:18.788 --> 05:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
am
 
05:43:20.830 --> 05:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon someone said earlier I don't
 
05:43:22.670 --> 05:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
want to be here I was kind of laughing
 
05:43:25.270 --> 05:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on
 
05:43:28.110 --> 05:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
that uh my name is Kim moltisanti I
 
05:43:29.390 --> 05:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
homeschool four children children in
 
05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
marac New Hampshire we are an unfunded
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh RSA
 
05:43:37.230 --> 05:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
193a homeschool family I oppose this
 
05:43:40.468 --> 05:43:40.478 align:start position:0%
bill as um almost everyone here does so
 
05:43:42.030 --> 05:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
many points were made today that I
 
05:43:43.788 --> 05:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
completely scrapped my notes and I'm
 
05:43:45.948 --> 05:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
going to read this chicken scratch here
 
05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just address um the these
 
05:43:51.510 --> 05:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is was written with very broad
 
05:43:53.270 --> 05:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
language and so everyone's talking about
 
05:43:54.910 --> 05:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
amendments and all these things and
 
05:43:57.030 --> 05:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's the the part that the people of
 
05:43:58.390 --> 05:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where we get nervous
 
05:44:00.070 --> 05:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we came here for our freedom
 
05:44:01.788 --> 05:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
when I met my husband I lived in
 
05:44:03.230 --> 05:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and he lived in New
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he works in nsha and I was
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
pushing to live closer to my family and
 
05:44:09.510 --> 05:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
he said it's going to be more free in
 
05:44:11.270 --> 05:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the home school laws are
 
05:44:13.708 --> 05:44:13.718 align:start position:0%
Freer the life is Freer and now I'm
 
05:44:15.390 --> 05:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
looking at this if this bill passes it
 
05:44:17.390 --> 05:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
will be the strictest and most regulated
 
05:44:19.628 --> 05:44:19.638 align:start position:0%
homeschool state in the United States
 
05:44:21.868 --> 05:44:21.878 align:start position:0%
which is wild to me so I'm asking you to
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
oppose it um and and one more point
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
there there are a lot of families here
 
05:44:29.070 --> 05:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
that are accept accepting the EA fund
 
05:44:31.468 --> 05:44:31.478 align:start position:0%
for lots of reasons uh right wrong or
 
05:44:33.510 --> 05:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
indifferent I want you to consider the
 
05:44:35.708 --> 05:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
number of families here who qualify for
 
05:44:38.468 --> 05:44:38.478 align:start position:0%
the help and don't ask for it it's
 
05:44:40.628 --> 05:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
because we want to be left alone I'm not
 
05:44:42.628 --> 05:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
asking you my tax dollars go to your
 
05:44:45.430 --> 05:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
schools I'm that's great I'm not asking
 
05:44:46.910 --> 05:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
for funding to homeschool my kids we're
 
05:44:48.548 --> 05:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
taking on that financial burden and
 
05:44:50.990 --> 05:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
sacrifice just to be left alone and I
 
05:44:52.990 --> 05:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
think that's that's probably the biggest
 
05:44:54.670 --> 05:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
point I could make today so thank you
 
05:44:57.110 --> 05:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
for listening do you have any questions
 
05:44:59.868 --> 05:44:59.878 align:start position:0%

05:45:02.430 --> 05:45:02.440 align:start position:0%

committee thank you thank you very
much

05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%

um going to jump uh to lra
 
05:45:11.430 --> 05:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%

welcome my name is lar Brown and I live
 
05:45:27.468 --> 05:45:27.478 align:start position:0%
in bosow New Hampshire I'm opposing this
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill because it would make me and my
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
brother and sister go into a public
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
school and take a test every year the
 
05:45:35.628 --> 05:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
reason I do not want to do this is
 
05:45:37.350 --> 05:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
because public school kids do not have
 
05:45:40.708 --> 05:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
to take this test so why should
 
05:45:42.788 --> 05:45:42.798 align:start position:0%

yeah New Hampshire by degree is not
 
05:46:51.430 --> 05:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
displaying the level of ignorance we've
 
05:46:56.750 --> 05:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
seen in our neighbors in Maine or
 
05:47:00.150 --> 05:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
Colorado which was uh on the front page
 
05:47:04.110 --> 05:47:04.120 align:start position:0%

unilaterally an individual in Maine or a
 
05:47:16.910 --> 05:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
group of whoever in Colorado deny all
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
other citizens in their state the right

05:47:54.468 --> 05:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over those who uh
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%

05:48:30.670 --> 05:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
confused um literacy in
 
05:48:35.120 --> 05:48:36.868 align:start position:0%
confused um literacy in
America

05:48:36.868 --> 05:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
America
 
05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
preceded formal
 
05:48:42.990 --> 05:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
education and it was a high rate of
 
05:48:46.990 --> 05:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
literacy I'm talking in the high 90th
 
05:48:50.468 --> 05:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
percentile Connecticut uh
 
05:48:53.110 --> 05:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh New Hampshire if you
 
05:48:54.670 --> 05:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
05:48:59.230 --> 05:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
1853 New Hampshire school board report
 
05:49:02.910 --> 05:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
and look at the charts uh I think in the
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
whole town of uh gtown there might have
 
05:49:09.670 --> 05:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
only been a couple children or even
 
05:49:12.990 --> 05:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
adults were counted that could not read
 
05:49:16.788 --> 05:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
and write your your time is up okay

know pieces of
 
05:49:38.110 --> 05:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
information and the reason is
 
05:49:43.548 --> 05:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
because uh of potential intimidation or
 
05:49:47.830 --> 05:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
whatever like education of parities
 
05:49:49.670 --> 05:49:49.680 align:start position:0%

05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
yes good afternoon um my name is Serena
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
vley and I reside in Conquer New
 
05:50:21.310 --> 05:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have seven kids and over the
 
05:50:23.468 --> 05:50:23.478 align:start position:0%
years I've homeschooled them I've
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
private school sent them to private
 
05:50:28.468 --> 05:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
school public school we've done vac
 
05:50:28.478 --> 05:50:29.548 align:start position:0%
school public school we've done vac
we've

05:50:29.548 --> 05:50:29.558 align:start position:0%
we've
 
05:50:33.430 --> 05:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
done um online school and we've
 
05:50:36.948 --> 05:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
done the EFA program so a lot of the
 
05:50:38.628 --> 05:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
things here have already been covered so
 
05:50:42.070 --> 05:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want to focus on that today um
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
and I agree with almost all of it but
 
05:50:49.548 --> 05:50:49.558 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to talk about today was um
 
05:50:51.750 --> 05:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account so if the
 
05:50:54.830 --> 05:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
bill is focused just on stuent
 
05:50:56.708 --> 05:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
recipients of the education Freedom
 
05:50:58.868 --> 05:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
account I'd like to just
 
05:51:02.110 --> 05:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
um point out that the purpose of the
 
05:51:04.830 --> 05:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account was
 
05:51:04.840 --> 05:51:06.948 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account was
Freedom

05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
Freedom
 
05:51:10.150 --> 05:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
meaning it covers people sending kids or
 
05:51:13.150 --> 05:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
having kids homeschool sending kids to
 
05:51:15.468 --> 05:51:15.478 align:start position:0%
private school and the idea was wanting
 
05:51:19.468 --> 05:51:19.478 align:start position:0%
to encourage homeschooling and other
 
05:51:21.510 --> 05:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
things so I understand it's a separate
 
05:51:24.788 --> 05:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
program but the purpose was to encourage
 
05:51:27.708 --> 05:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
Freedom um so the testing that we have
 
05:51:29.070 --> 05:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
05:51:33.270 --> 05:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
in the context of public schools so we
 
05:51:35.948 --> 05:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
are the state is over public schools and
 
05:51:37.628 --> 05:51:37.638 align:start position:0%
so therefore would need to test them
 
05:51:40.270 --> 05:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
because we have authority over those and
 
05:51:42.110 --> 05:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure like we're
 
05:51:43.948 --> 05:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
administering them so we need to see how
 
05:51:47.310 --> 05:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
they're working and use that testing to
 
05:51:49.310 --> 05:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
evaluate and that's the purpose of
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
testing and that's fine but in this
 
05:51:58.830 --> 05:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
context of um the people who are doing
 
05:52:02.350 --> 05:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and other things um the
 
05:52:04.990 --> 05:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
idea was to give people that freedom and
 
05:52:09.190 --> 05:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
not to impose more regulation and I just
 
05:52:11.190 --> 05:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
one thing that I want to point out is
 
05:52:14.030 --> 05:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
that we don't have control over private
 
05:52:17.788 --> 05:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
schools or um homeschooling families we
 
05:52:19.948 --> 05:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
you have control over the schools the
 
05:52:22.310 --> 05:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
public schools so that the testing is
 
05:52:24.030 --> 05:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
only for that and as other people have
 
05:52:26.670 --> 05:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
said we already have requirements that
 
05:52:29.230 --> 05:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
we have to meet um and then I would just
 
05:52:32.350 --> 05:52:32.360 align:start position:0%
finally say that you're here to serve
 
05:52:35.468 --> 05:52:35.478 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire people and there
 
05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
aren't the New Hampshire people are not
 
05:52:39.070 --> 05:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
asking for this they're not there's
 
05:52:41.590 --> 05:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
nobody saying this is what we need so I
 
05:52:44.350 --> 05:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
just ask that you vote in expedient to
 
05:52:46.590 --> 05:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you any questions from
 
05:52:46.600 --> 05:52:47.750 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you any questions from
the

05:52:47.750 --> 05:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:52:54.628 --> 05:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:57.150 --> 05:52:57.160 align:start position:0%

uh is Jody
 
05:53:12.628 --> 05:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
a consoles here
 
05:53:14.590 --> 05:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
tried pardon
 
05:53:16.830 --> 05:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
me Jody
 
05:53:23.788 --> 05:53:23.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:26.548 --> 05:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
yeah you don't get the
 
05:53:28.708 --> 05:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
card I'm there somewhere
 
05:53:30.628 --> 05:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody it's a long day
 
05:53:33.590 --> 05:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
isn't it uh my name is jod Underwood I
 
05:53:35.708 --> 05:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
live in cro New Hampshire um my husband
 
05:53:38.070 --> 05:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
and I coote this testimony a lot of
 
05:53:39.430 --> 05:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
which I am not going to read because
 
05:53:41.910 --> 05:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's been covered um but I will share my
 
05:53:43.868 --> 05:53:43.878 align:start position:0%
the testimony with um representative
 
05:53:47.910 --> 05:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
beler after um so I have to say that
 
05:53:49.510 --> 05:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
this bill appears to be a thinly
 
05:53:51.230 --> 05:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
disguised attempt to subject
 
05:53:53.468 --> 05:53:53.478 align:start position:0%
home-educated students to the kind of
 
05:53:55.548 --> 05:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
micro and mismanagement that prompted
 
05:53:56.910 --> 05:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
their parents to keep them out of
 
05:53:58.868 --> 05:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
schools in the first place
 
05:54:00.868 --> 05:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
now this interpretation can't be
 
05:54:03.708 --> 05:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
dismissed out of hand my husband
 
05:54:05.350 --> 05:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
personally witnessed members of an
 
05:54:06.948 --> 05:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
activist Group which includes one of the
 
05:54:09.910 --> 05:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
Bill's sponsors formulating plans to
 
05:54:11.788 --> 05:54:11.798 align:start position:0%
collect copies of the birth certificates
 
05:54:13.230 --> 05:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
of all the children born in New
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in order to keep tabs on
 
05:54:17.430 --> 05:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
children whose parents keep them out of
 
05:54:20.390 --> 05:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
the system excuse
 
05:54:22.430 --> 05:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
me I'm
 
05:54:25.510 --> 05:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
person that's not a factual statement it
 
05:54:27.750 --> 05:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
was his experience he was there he saw
 
05:54:27.760 --> 05:54:28.708 align:start position:0%
was his experience he was there he saw
it

05:54:28.708 --> 05:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:54:31.788 --> 05:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
I will will you state on task with this
 
05:54:34.468 --> 05:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
bill please well it is it was completely
 
05:54:35.868 --> 05:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
about the
 
05:54:39.670 --> 05:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
bill so that was point one um we do
 
05:54:42.190 --> 05:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
agree that if a student is taking money
 
05:54:44.910 --> 05:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers those taxpayers have an
 
05:54:46.548 --> 05:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
interest in seeing what they're getting
 
05:54:47.868 --> 05:54:47.878 align:start position:0%
something that they're getting something
 
05:54:49.948 --> 05:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
for their money we might call this the
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
if we pay we get a say principle or pay
 
05:54:57.548 --> 05:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
say for short so this would also mean
 
05:55:00.150 --> 05:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
that it would appli to public schools so
 
05:55:02.310 --> 05:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
and right now public school students can
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
exempt themselves from taking the state
 
05:55:05.468 --> 05:55:05.478 align:start position:0%
assessment but that goes against the
 
05:55:07.270 --> 05:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
accountability that this test is
 
05:55:10.030 --> 05:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to do so if you know in other
 
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
words if you don't want your kids to
 
05:55:12.990 --> 05:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
take those assessments that's fine but
 
05:55:14.590 --> 05:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
then they shouldn't be able to attend
 
05:55:16.590 --> 05:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
the schools right for free they would
 
05:55:17.948 --> 05:55:17.958 align:start position:0%
have to make other arrangements like
 
05:55:21.150 --> 05:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
paid tuition or homeschool or otherwise
 
05:55:24.270 --> 05:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
um my third Point um adds on to what
 
05:55:26.510 --> 05:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative seller said he mentioned
 
05:55:28.150 --> 05:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
learning environments and that there was
 
05:55:30.510 --> 05:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
a problem with such a broad statement
 
05:55:32.430 --> 05:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to add on to that to
 
05:55:35.628 --> 05:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
to um give further examples so it it's a
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
very vague statement so for example if I
 
05:55:39.948 --> 05:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
use EFA funds to pay for jiujitsu
 
05:55:42.750 --> 05:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
classes piano lessons and these are used
 
05:55:45.708 --> 05:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
for these um types of classes that
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
clearly takes place in a learning
 
05:55:49.868 --> 05:55:49.878 align:start position:0%
environment if I use EA funds to buy a
 
05:55:52.150 --> 05:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
computer so my kid my kid can use Con
 
05:55:53.590 --> 05:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
Academy that's clearly a learning
 
05:55:55.430 --> 05:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
environment does that mean that the gym
 
05:55:57.948 --> 05:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
or the time is up that was 2 minutes
 
05:56:01.150 --> 05:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
that was two minutes wow damn oh well
 
05:56:04.070 --> 05:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
all right um thank you you're more than
 
05:56:06.708 --> 05:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
welcome uh Jen
 
05:56:10.468 --> 05:56:10.478 align:start position:0%

05:56:36.030 --> 05:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
organization we did already email you a
 
05:56:37.868 --> 05:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
statement in opposition to this bill
 
05:56:39.310 --> 05:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
what I would like to share is my
 
05:56:42.430 --> 05:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
personal testimony um I have brought
 
05:56:44.270 --> 05:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
with me today an essay which my
 
05:56:47.910 --> 05:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
16-year-old son wrote um it is about
 
05:56:50.990 --> 05:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hannibal's March um and his first major
 
05:56:53.468 --> 05:56:53.478 align:start position:0%
victory in Italy he went back to primary
 
05:56:55.830 --> 05:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
sources and he read them and he
 
05:56:58.150 --> 05:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
formulated this Essay with good par
 
05:57:00.708 --> 05:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
structure sentences which would be good
 
05:57:02.990 --> 05:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
for any child um but I'm especially
 
05:57:04.868 --> 05:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
proud of him because he could not have
 
05:57:07.190 --> 05:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
taken a standardized test in early
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
elementary school because he has
 
05:57:11.150 --> 05:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
dyslexia he could not read or write well
 
05:57:14.270 --> 05:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
in those years um so I am bringing this
 
05:57:15.948 --> 05:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
essay for you to look at as a positive
 
05:57:18.270 --> 05:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
outcome for homeschooling thank you
 
05:57:19.750 --> 05:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much now do we have a
 
05:57:21.030 --> 05:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
copy of that or are you going to drop
 
05:57:23.350 --> 05:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
that off thank you
 
05:57:26.190 --> 05:57:26.200 align:start position:0%

05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:42.030 --> 05:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
Lambert welcome good afternoon uh Dave
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
gin here um we're a traditional unfunded
 
05:57:49.830 --> 05:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh 193a homeschool family of two uh
 
05:57:52.788 --> 05:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
we're here to oppose hb610
 
05:57:55.948 --> 05:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
the reason is fundamentally the purpose
 
05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill really is to function as a
 
05:58:01.430 --> 05:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
poison pill for the entire homeschooling
 
05:58:04.310 --> 05:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
Community it is intended to push us all
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
of us whether traditional 193 or EFA
 
05:58:12.788 --> 05:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
families teach each to uh a very
 
05:58:16.150 --> 05:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
problematic test that is linked to a
 
05:58:18.708 --> 05:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
mediocre and morally bankrupt Common
 
05:58:18.718 --> 05:58:20.390 align:start position:0%
mediocre and morally bankrupt Common
Core

05:58:20.390 --> 05:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
Core
 
05:58:23.030 --> 05:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
Curriculum as such it's really an it's
 
05:58:24.868 --> 05:58:24.878 align:start position:0%
it's an attack on homeschooling families
 
05:58:26.750 --> 05:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
and families in general because it is
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
presupposes that
 
05:58:31.310 --> 05:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
um the government
 
05:58:33.350 --> 05:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
um School
 
05:58:36.030 --> 05:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
administrators ass sorted other other
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats know it is best for our kids
 
05:58:41.868 --> 05:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
better than we do as
 
05:58:44.628 --> 05:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
parents we should be the primary
 
05:58:48.310 --> 05:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
decision makers not the state not the
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
education system those of us who choose
 
05:58:53.390 --> 05:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
to participate in the
 
05:58:56.270 --> 05:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
homeschooling uh
 
05:58:58.230 --> 05:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
Endeavor in
 
05:59:00.270 --> 05:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
and if you think about it logically why
 
05:59:02.948 --> 05:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
did we go through all this difficulty
 
05:59:06.110 --> 05:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
all this trouble of embarking on this
 
05:59:08.708 --> 05:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
homeschool project because we want to
 
05:59:12.030 --> 05:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
avoid these tests these government tests
 
05:59:15.030 --> 05:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
we want to avoid Common Core we want to
 
05:59:17.788 --> 05:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
avoid everything that comes all that
 
05:59:20.390 --> 05:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
negative baggage that we associate with
 
05:59:22.070 --> 05:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
the public education system that's
 
05:59:25.230 --> 05:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
precisely what we work so hard to avoid
 
05:59:26.670 --> 05:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
and what this bill is doing is
 
05:59:29.590 --> 05:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
essentially fostering it back back upon
 
05:59:33.750 --> 05:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
us um so for that reason um we would
 
05:59:35.708 --> 05:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
like to we you know we strongly oppose
 
05:59:37.868 --> 05:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
this bill and we'd like to uh see it
 
05:59:39.390 --> 05:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
rejected in its entirety without
 
05:59:41.590 --> 05:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
amendments just completely rejected in
 
05:59:44.390 --> 05:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
full you know basically K like the
 
05:59:46.430 --> 05:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said in 1925 the kids
 
05:59:48.628 --> 05:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
belong to the to the parents to the moms
 
05:59:51.788 --> 05:59:51.798 align:start position:0%
and dads not to the state um and that's
 
05:59:53.310 --> 05:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
what we that's what we are here to
 
05:59:55.990 --> 05:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
defend thank you thank you very
 
05:59:59.230 --> 05:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
much any questions the
 
06:00:01.948 --> 06:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
committee okay Kate
 
06:00:01.958 --> 06:00:05.030 align:start position:0%
committee okay Kate
Bloom

06:00:05.030 --> 06:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
y done hi I'm Kate Bloom from where New
 
06:00:11.030 --> 06:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot of my topics have been
 
06:00:12.788 --> 06:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
touched on so I'm going to come at this
 
06:00:15.548 --> 06:00:15.558 align:start position:0%
from a different angle as a taxpayer um
 
06:00:17.948 --> 06:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire I am also
 
06:00:20.548 --> 06:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
a traditional unschooling or traditional
 
06:00:22.910 --> 06:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
homeschooling family with three children
 
06:00:25.548 --> 06:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
um so the fiscal note on this bill says
 
06:00:27.468 --> 06:00:27.478 align:start position:0%
that it will cost the state at least 2.5
 
06:00:30.910 --> 06:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
$5 million a year um plus the cost in
 
06:00:33.510 --> 06:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
the local education if the goal is to be
 
06:00:35.150 --> 06:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
accountable to the taxpayers does it
 
06:00:37.310 --> 06:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
really Mak sense to be spending $2.5
 
06:00:39.590 --> 06:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
million a year to force unfunded
 
06:00:42.230 --> 06:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers and EFA students to take
 
06:00:43.708 --> 06:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
assessments when we already have
 
06:00:45.750 --> 06:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
accountability measures in place via
 
06:00:47.788 --> 06:00:47.798 align:start position:0%
required annual education assessments
 
06:00:49.868 --> 06:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
this is something that is already
 
06:00:52.070 --> 06:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
covered under current law do we need to
 
06:00:53.948 --> 06:00:53.958 align:start position:0%
spend Millions more dollars every year
 
06:00:57.548 --> 06:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
of taxpayer money I don't think so um
 
06:01:00.350 --> 06:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
few questions to ponder on do the
 
06:01:02.670 --> 06:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
results of standardized tests prove the
 
06:01:05.468 --> 06:01:05.478 align:start position:0%
Worth or adequacy of an education will
 
06:01:07.390 --> 06:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
these test results be used to determine
 
06:01:09.390 --> 06:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
if the EFA program is successful or if
 
06:01:10.830 --> 06:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
the tax money is being spent in a
 
06:01:13.110 --> 06:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
worthwhile way if you do think the
 
06:01:15.070 --> 06:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
results of a test can prove that money
 
06:01:16.990 --> 06:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
isn't being spent well then what does
 
06:01:18.750 --> 06:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
that say about the public school system
 
06:01:21.230 --> 06:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
and its accountability to taxpayers we
 
06:01:23.310 --> 06:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
only need to look at the alarmingly low
 
06:01:25.390 --> 06:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
State assessment data of public school
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
students to show that public schools are
 
06:01:30.150 --> 06:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
fa in and their obligation to taxpayers
 
06:01:32.110 --> 06:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
yet there's no recourse for misuse of
 
06:01:34.430 --> 06:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
public funds for public school
 
06:01:36.590 --> 06:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
students under New Hampshire homeschool
 
06:01:38.390 --> 06:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
law annual educational assessments are
 
06:01:40.150 --> 06:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
private and can't be used to terminate a
 
06:01:42.270 --> 06:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
home education program with these
 
06:01:43.868 --> 06:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
required State assessments the results
 
06:01:46.190 --> 06:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
will be reported to the state does being
 
06:01:48.190 --> 06:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
forced to take State assessments open us
 
06:01:50.030 --> 06:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
up to some kind of scrutiny if our child
 
06:01:52.830 --> 06:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet a certain level this is a
 
06:01:54.990 --> 06:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
direct conflict with the statutes that
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
have been secured via the home school
 
06:02:00.350 --> 06:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
law that is already in place um please
 
06:02:03.070 --> 06:02:03.080 align:start position:0%

06:02:05.110 --> 06:02:05.120 align:start position:0%

under
 
06:02:40.310 --> 06:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
193a um which is unfunded so I guess the
 
06:02:42.310 --> 06:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
first thing I want to talk about is um
 
06:02:44.670 --> 06:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
well I'll get back to the unfunded piece
 
06:02:47.708 --> 06:02:47.718 align:start position:0%
um just a quick story um everybody has
 
06:02:50.510 --> 06:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
said things um many different ways and
 
06:02:53.230 --> 06:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
and they're all true
 
06:02:56.430 --> 06:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
um I still follow our school board I
 
06:02:59.548 --> 06:02:59.558 align:start position:0%
still go to their meeting despite that I
 
06:03:02.548 --> 06:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
I homeschool um and because I care I
 
06:03:05.150 --> 06:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
care where my money goes as a taxpayer
 
06:03:07.390 --> 06:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
and I also care and what they're
 
06:03:10.868 --> 06:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
receiving um I recently um about a year
 
06:03:12.430 --> 06:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
ago I went to our budget committee which
 
06:03:15.548 --> 06:03:15.558 align:start position:0%
sets the budget and um a conversation
 
06:03:17.390 --> 06:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
ensued this became very clear to me when
 
06:03:19.150 --> 06:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
I read this language of this bill it
 
06:03:21.310 --> 06:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
seems awful familiar to me is that there
 
06:03:24.590 --> 06:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
was a long discussion about tracking of
 
06:03:26.110 --> 06:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
home education
 
06:03:30.468 --> 06:03:30.478 align:start position:0%
students and and as it relates to money
 
06:03:33.548 --> 06:03:33.558 align:start position:0%
it relates to money so this was very
 
06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
disturbing to me um and I told them so
 
06:03:39.628 --> 06:03:39.638 align:start position:0%
that we don't track children number one
 
06:03:41.468 --> 06:03:41.478 align:start position:0%
number two they're they don't have a
 
06:03:44.350 --> 06:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
dollar sign on their head and so when I
 
06:03:45.990 --> 06:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
read this despite the fact we're
 
06:03:49.750 --> 06:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
spending $2.5 million
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
to um effectively make this both so um
 
06:03:56.430 --> 06:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
it really is trying to do exactly that
 
06:03:57.750 --> 06:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's trying to check
 
06:04:01.670 --> 06:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
children um I I don't want to um I don't
 
06:04:03.628 --> 06:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
need to use my full two minutes but
 
06:04:06.190 --> 06:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
going back to the unfunded what this is
 
06:04:07.948 --> 06:04:07.958 align:start position:0%
about is
 
06:04:10.910 --> 06:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
contracts we do not have a contract with
 
06:04:14.430 --> 06:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
the state we do not have a contract with
 
06:04:15.750 --> 06:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
the local
 
06:04:18.468 --> 06:04:18.478 align:start position:0%
municipality we pulled them out and we
 
06:04:21.270 --> 06:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
did that for a reason to provide our own
 
06:04:24.548 --> 06:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
education so I'm not quite sure in
 
06:04:26.070 --> 06:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
trying to and I realize there's an
 
06:04:28.150 --> 06:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to change things around I'm
 
06:04:30.150 --> 06:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how legal this would be
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
we do not have a contract so I will
 
06:04:35.868 --> 06:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
leave it there and I'm happy to answer
 
06:04:38.590 --> 06:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much other
 
06:04:40.150 --> 06:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
06:04:43.548 --> 06:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:49.070 --> 06:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:51.788 --> 06:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
Kristen Krist I appreciate this my uh
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
parking meter is about to run out how
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
many times does run out uh no I have
 
06:04:58.230 --> 06:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
parked in three hours so I still have
 
06:05:02.110 --> 06:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
about 10 minutes Joseph perelli is next
 
06:05:04.150 --> 06:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Kristen dennisk I live in
 
06:05:07.510 --> 06:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
hener I'm speaking as an RSA 193a
 
06:05:09.788 --> 06:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
independent unfunded homeschool parent I
 
06:05:10.830 --> 06:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
just want to thank the committee first
 
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
of all for remaining to listen to so
 
06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
many testimonies I've been to hearings
 
06:05:16.070 --> 06:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
before where they didn't sit and listen
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
and it was infuriating I submitted my
 
06:05:19.990 --> 06:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
testimony through the online portal
 
06:05:21.430 --> 06:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
everything I wanted to say has been said
 
06:05:22.868 --> 06:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
and said clearly I think so I won't
 
06:05:24.628 --> 06:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
repeat it I think we could have a
 
06:05:26.390 --> 06:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
hearing about this proposed amendment
 
06:05:28.310 --> 06:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
because I don't trust it to be written
 
06:05:30.628 --> 06:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
well I ask that you either ensure an
 
06:05:32.468 --> 06:05:32.478 align:start position:0%
amendment approved by Michelle LEL
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
passes or vote itl against this bill
 
06:05:37.510 --> 06:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
outright I also ask as politely as
 
06:05:39.190 --> 06:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
possible that in the future you please
 
06:05:42.310 --> 06:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
don't forget to exclude us RSA 193a
 
06:05:44.590 --> 06:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
independent unfunded homeschool families
 
06:05:50.270 --> 06:05:50.280 align:start position:0%

you hello for the record my name is
 
06:06:38.830 --> 06:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
Erica Golder I'm from lonia New
 
06:06:42.788 --> 06:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am an unfunded homeschooling
 
06:06:46.350 --> 06:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
parent I appreciate the opportunity to
 
06:06:50.110 --> 06:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
express my concerns here with hb610
 
06:06:54.270 --> 06:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
I urge you to oppose this bill uh itl
 
06:07:01.030 --> 06:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:03.468 --> 06:07:03.478 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say that the state has
 
06:07:05.468 --> 06:07:05.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely no right to intervene into a
 
06:07:07.910 --> 06:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
parent choice for their children which
 
06:07:10.910 --> 06:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
is statistically far superior to your
 
06:07:13.548 --> 06:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
institutional model um that's exactly
 
06:07:15.430 --> 06:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
what this bill will
 
06:07:18.150 --> 06:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
do I can hand this in but I have um
 
06:07:20.670 --> 06:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
plenty of homeschooling statistics uh
 
06:07:22.628 --> 06:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
just in lonia for instance when we're
 
06:07:25.390 --> 06:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the public institutional
 
06:07:28.510 --> 06:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
School the uh we have five schools
 
06:07:31.750 --> 06:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's 1831 students we have 178
 
06:07:34.270 --> 06:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
teachers for a public school the the
 
06:07:37.868 --> 06:07:37.878 align:start position:0%
graduation rate is um 80 to 84% on
 
06:07:40.390 --> 06:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
average math proficiency is
 
06:07:43.468 --> 06:07:43.478 align:start position:0%
24% reading proficiency is
 
06:07:46.990 --> 06:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
31% uh they spend over $20,000 per
 
06:07:50.750 --> 06:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:54.190 --> 06:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
education um just a a few homeschooling
 
06:07:57.788 --> 06:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
statistics uh 15 to 25% above
 
06:08:00.468 --> 06:08:00.478 align:start position:0%
um homeschoolers
 
06:08:03.868 --> 06:08:03.878 align:start position:0%
homeschooling tests uh I'm sorry let me
 
06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
start over 15 to 25% homeschoolers test
 
06:08:09.590 --> 06:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
above public school students on
 
06:08:11.868 --> 06:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
standardized tests I know you heard
 
06:08:13.510 --> 06:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
somebody uh previously saying that they
 
06:08:16.670 --> 06:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
didn't make enough money to um uh give
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
their child a good enough education to
 
06:08:20.990 --> 06:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
do well on this test but frankly the
 
06:08:22.468 --> 06:08:22.478 align:start position:0%
students aren't taught the the
 
06:08:25.788 --> 06:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
curriculum to do well in these tests um
 
06:08:28.910 --> 06:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
just shouldn't exist
 
06:08:31.310 --> 06:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
um the degree of State control and
 
06:08:32.910 --> 06:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
regulation of homeschooling is not
 
06:08:35.110 --> 06:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
related to academic achievement that was
 
06:08:37.590 --> 06:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
per US Department of Education uh that
 
06:08:39.230 --> 06:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
was their statement in
 
06:08:41.548 --> 06:08:41.558 align:start position:0%
2019 again I'm going to be submitting
 
06:08:44.468 --> 06:08:44.478 align:start position:0%
this information here um just have three
 
06:08:47.230 --> 06:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
quick questions I have other statistics
 
06:08:48.910 --> 06:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
that you can read
 
06:08:51.430 --> 06:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
later uh question number one how is
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
inserting institutional school policies
 
06:08:54.868 --> 06:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
into the homeschooling curriculum going
 
06:08:57.030 --> 06:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
to help or improve anything where the
 
06:08:59.628 --> 06:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
institutional model is statistically
 
06:09:02.830 --> 06:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
inferior number two why do we not take a
 
06:09:04.590 --> 06:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
a better look at the homeschool model
 
06:09:07.070 --> 06:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
which is statistically Superior and why
 
06:09:09.628 --> 06:09:09.638 align:start position:0%
and uh was which is statistically
 
06:09:12.070 --> 06:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
Superior and not Implement intrusive
 
06:09:14.990 --> 06:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
State policies into the homeschool model
 
06:09:16.868 --> 06:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
and the third and final rhetorical
 
06:09:20.390 --> 06:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
question is how is it that the state how
 
06:09:21.948 --> 06:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
is it that the average cost per
 
06:09:24.070 --> 06:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
homeschooled student is
 
06:09:26.390 --> 06:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
11% what the national public school
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
child is yet homeschooled children and
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
most metrics are academically double
 
06:09:34.270 --> 06:09:34.280 align:start position:0%
digits ahead of the institutional
 
06:09:37.230 --> 06:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
counterparts thank thank you very much
 
06:09:39.350 --> 06:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the
 
06:09:45.708 --> 06:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:48.510 --> 06:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
Joseph and then Steven
 
06:09:55.150 --> 06:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:57.070 --> 06:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
Ramsey good afternoon thank you for your
 
06:09:59.510 --> 06:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
time my name is Joseph pelli um
 
06:10:02.948 --> 06:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
represent my 193a homeschool family live
 
06:10:05.270 --> 06:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
in Dober um obviously I like everyone
 
06:10:07.230 --> 06:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
else here I show up today to speak
 
06:10:09.708 --> 06:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
against this poorly written bill um
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
rather than reiterating what's already
 
06:10:13.110 --> 06:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
been said I'd like to focus on two
 
06:10:16.390 --> 06:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
points uh this bill does nothing to help
 
06:10:18.628 --> 06:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
students and families in the state
 
06:10:20.548 --> 06:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
however according to the bill analysis
 
06:10:22.468 --> 06:10:22.478 align:start position:0%
and as many of others have said it's
 
06:10:24.990 --> 06:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
going to cost $2.5 million per fiscal
 
06:10:27.190 --> 06:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
year $2 million loan
 
06:10:30.590 --> 06:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
um just for the tracking uh portion of
 
06:10:33.030 --> 06:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
it data collection on the students that
 
06:10:34.390 --> 06:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
will be taking the
 
06:10:37.310 --> 06:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
test again this provides absolutely no
 
06:10:39.468 --> 06:10:39.478 align:start position:0%
benefit to anyone while it carries a
 
06:10:41.628 --> 06:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
tremendous cost to
 
06:10:44.670 --> 06:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers point two it is disingenuous
 
06:10:46.590 --> 06:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
and perhaps deceitful for representative
 
06:10:49.468 --> 06:10:49.478 align:start position:0%
cascaden to Pedal this as a bill that's
 
06:10:52.350 --> 06:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
EFA related uh this bill is written as
 
06:10:54.670 --> 06:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
in as it is written requires
 
06:10:57.030 --> 06:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
standardized testing of all students
 
06:11:00.070 --> 06:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
from all uh public non-public and all
 
06:11:02.990 --> 06:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
learning environments unfortunately she
 
06:11:05.230 --> 06:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
forgot to update the part where public
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
school students were allowed
 
06:11:12.590 --> 06:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
to just talk reference the bill sure uh
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
it was poorly written and doesn't allow
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh anyone but the public school students
 
06:11:20.230 --> 06:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
to uh opt
 
06:11:22.468 --> 06:11:22.478 align:start position:0%
out uh we need to be able to trust our
 
06:11:23.948 --> 06:11:23.958 align:start position:0%
representatives and these kind of
 
06:11:25.670 --> 06:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
deceptive tactics to insert the state
 
06:11:27.868 --> 06:11:27.878 align:start position:0%
into lives of families only serve to
 
06:11:30.270 --> 06:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
erode that trust uh so if any future
 
06:11:32.910 --> 06:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
bills come up again like this I ask to
 
06:11:35.110 --> 06:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
please not waste our time and expect
 
06:11:37.030 --> 06:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
that we will show up again in opposition
 
06:11:39.310 --> 06:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
to that bill as we care about our
 
06:11:41.628 --> 06:11:41.638 align:start position:0%
children and we like to ra healthy happy
 
06:11:43.948 --> 06:11:43.958 align:start position:0%
children who are well educated according
 
06:11:46.670 --> 06:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
to the way that we wish to educate our
 
06:11:47.948 --> 06:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
children and doesn't require any
 
06:11:50.548 --> 06:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
standardized testing to do
 
06:11:53.430 --> 06:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much other questions
 
06:11:57.628 --> 06:11:57.638 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you
 
06:11:59.548 --> 06:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
uh in the back of the room are you have
 
06:12:01.590 --> 06:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
a young child on your lap are you
 
06:12:04.190 --> 06:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
waiting to speak I already did yeah I
 
06:12:04.200 --> 06:12:07.190 align:start position:0%
waiting to speak I already did yeah I
thought

06:12:07.190 --> 06:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:12.468 --> 06:12:12.478 align:start position:0%
so uh Steve okay Steve
 
06:12:14.750 --> 06:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
yes and then
 
06:12:14.760 --> 06:12:22.548 align:start position:0%
yes and then
Lisa

06:12:22.548 --> 06:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:25.150 --> 06:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
neston great good afternoon and thank
 
06:12:27.548 --> 06:12:27.558 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak um my name
 
06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
is step and I live in DOA New Hampshire
 
06:12:32.030 --> 06:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
and we homeschool our kids and I POS
 
06:12:34.030 --> 06:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
this bill that would require mandatory
 
06:12:36.190 --> 06:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
standardized test in all learning
 
06:12:38.868 --> 06:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
environments including homeschooling we
 
06:12:41.190 --> 06:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
do not participate in the fa program but
 
06:12:42.468 --> 06:12:42.478 align:start position:0%
I'm going to Echo a concern because I
 
06:12:44.030 --> 06:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
think it's important to reiterate that
 
06:12:45.628 --> 06:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
you know the language in The Spill as
 
06:12:47.350 --> 06:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
it's written it does not clearly
 
06:12:48.788 --> 06:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
distinguish the difference between
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
families that receive EFA funds and
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
families that don't I'm also very
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about standardized test in
 
06:12:56.390 --> 06:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
general because there's a lot of
 
06:12:58.788 --> 06:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
concerns and valid criticism and as a
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
father I share the same ones some of
 
06:13:02.548 --> 06:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
them include they don't capture all the
 
06:13:04.030 --> 06:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
students skills and achievements
 
06:13:05.948 --> 06:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
standardized test scores don't predict
 
06:13:07.868 --> 06:13:07.878 align:start position:0%
future success there can be a lot of
 
06:13:09.948 --> 06:13:09.958 align:start position:0%
pressure to perform well which leads to
 
06:13:11.948 --> 06:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
teaching the test test questions could
 
06:13:14.468 --> 06:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
be biased and standard tests may only
 
06:13:15.670 --> 06:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
determine which students are good at
 
06:13:17.230 --> 06:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
taking tests and not you know their
 
06:13:19.230 --> 06:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
actual knowledge of a subject it's like
 
06:13:21.510 --> 06:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
a snapshot in time you know if I can use
 
06:13:23.270 --> 06:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
an analogy you know even a professional
 
06:13:25.350 --> 06:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
All-Star athletes they have bad days you
 
06:13:26.910 --> 06:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
know we don't just judge an athletes
 
06:13:29.190 --> 06:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
ability based on one game because one
 
06:13:31.030 --> 06:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
game doesn't reflect the entire season
 
06:13:33.548 --> 06:13:33.558 align:start position:0%
nor does a a standardized test capture
 
06:13:34.670 --> 06:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the learning
 
06:13:36.628 --> 06:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
environment and these shortfalls are
 
06:13:38.230 --> 06:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
even more concerning when trying to
 
06:13:39.708 --> 06:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
apply a standardized test to all
 
06:13:42.030 --> 06:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
learning environments you know we're so
 
06:13:43.670 --> 06:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
lucky to live in New Hampshire because
 
06:13:45.110 --> 06:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
we have different learning options for
 
06:13:47.110 --> 06:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
our kids we have public schools private
 
06:13:48.750 --> 06:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
schools charter schools and
 
06:13:50.750 --> 06:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
homeschooling which we do and these
 
06:13:52.468 --> 06:13:52.478 align:start position:0%
learning environments all have their own
 
06:13:54.548 --> 06:13:54.558 align:start position:0%
distinct teaching methods and they all
 
06:13:56.510 --> 06:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
have their own unique advantages and
 
06:13:57.910 --> 06:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is great because parents can choose
 
06:13:59.948 --> 06:13:59.958 align:start position:0%
the options that's best for their kids
 
06:14:01.510 --> 06:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
now every child is different so it
 
06:14:03.230 --> 06:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to expect every child
 
06:14:04.788 --> 06:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
to Excel and exceed in every type of
 
06:14:06.390 --> 06:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
learning environment it also doesn't
 
06:14:08.350 --> 06:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
make sense to test their performance the
 
06:14:09.628 --> 06:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
same way across all learning
 
06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
environments so I please uh oppose this
 
06:14:13.948 --> 06:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
bill that set forth today thank you
 
06:14:15.910 --> 06:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions from
 
06:14:15.920 --> 06:14:16.590 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions from
the

06:14:16.590 --> 06:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:14:21.548 --> 06:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much Lisa
 
06:14:25.270 --> 06:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
neston and then uh
 
06:14:25.280 --> 06:14:28.230 align:start position:0%

okay hi good afternoon my name is Lis
 
06:14:37.030 --> 06:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
Lucen and I live in do New Hampshire
 
06:14:38.510 --> 06:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
with my husband and our two young
 
06:14:40.390 --> 06:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
daughters we are a traditional
 
06:14:42.750 --> 06:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
homeschool family we are not part of the
 
06:14:45.070 --> 06:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
EFA program and I'm strongly opposed to
 
06:14:47.708 --> 06:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
this bill before homeschooling our
 
06:14:49.150 --> 06:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
children I was an elementary school
 
06:14:52.030 --> 06:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
teacher for 15 years one of the first
 
06:14:54.110 --> 06:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
things I learned as a teacher was that a
 
06:14:56.510 --> 06:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
formative assessment one which giv
 
06:14:57.990 --> 06:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
information to help improve student
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
learning is not an end of the unit test
 
06:15:03.150 --> 06:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
or quiz or for our purposes today a
 
06:15:03.160 --> 06:15:04.350 align:start position:0%
or quiz or for our purposes today a
standardized

06:15:04.350 --> 06:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
standardized
 
06:15:06.910 --> 06:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
test formative assessments give
 
06:15:08.868 --> 06:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
immediate and ongoing feedback about
 
06:15:10.830 --> 06:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
what a child has learned and they are
 
06:15:13.510 --> 06:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
tools to be used as an educator to guide
 
06:15:15.708 --> 06:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
instruction so I actually created
 
06:15:18.670 --> 06:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
portfolios for each child year after
 
06:15:20.430 --> 06:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
year I found that these portfolios
 
06:15:22.510 --> 06:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
clearly showed students progress to
 
06:15:24.628 --> 06:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
their parents while standardized test
 
06:15:26.510 --> 06:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
scores only provide a snapshot of a
 
06:15:29.150 --> 06:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
student's performance on one particular
 
06:15:32.070 --> 06:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
day as homeschooling families we are
 
06:15:34.750 --> 06:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
already conducting formative assessments
 
06:15:36.350 --> 06:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
we constantly observe and assess our
 
06:15:38.468 --> 06:15:38.478 align:start position:0%
children on a day-to-day basis without
 
06:15:40.868 --> 06:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
for standardized assessments and we are
 
06:15:42.150 --> 06:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
making adjustments to meet the
 
06:15:45.628 --> 06:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
individual individual needs of our own
 
06:15:48.750 --> 06:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
children for my own family I have no
 
06:15:50.190 --> 06:15:50.200 align:start position:0%
doubt that a standardized assessment
 
06:15:53.150 --> 06:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
would do more harm than good I have one
 
06:15:56.350 --> 06:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
child who has severe test anxiety
 
06:15:59.150 --> 06:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
especially when tasks are timed if she
 
06:16:00.750 --> 06:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
were forced to take these timed
 
06:16:02.990 --> 06:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
standardized assessments while sitting
 
06:16:05.510 --> 06:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
in a strange classro filled with
 
06:16:08.350 --> 06:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar children and adults I highly
 
06:16:10.468 --> 06:16:10.478 align:start position:0%
doubt that we be provided with any
 
06:16:10.478 --> 06:16:11.548 align:start position:0%
doubt that we be provided with any
objective

06:16:11.548 --> 06:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
objective
 
06:16:14.110 --> 06:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
data and while this proposal allows
 
06:16:16.110 --> 06:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
Public School parents to exempt their
 
06:16:18.510 --> 06:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
children from this assessment there is
 
06:16:20.468 --> 06:16:20.478 align:start position:0%
nothing which allows non-public school
 
06:16:23.150 --> 06:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
parents to exempt their children as
 
06:16:25.830 --> 06:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
well finally I would like to remind the
 
06:16:25.840 --> 06:16:26.750 align:start position:0%
well finally I would like to remind the
Comm

06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
Comm
 
06:16:28.788 --> 06:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
that homeschoolers can already choose
 
06:16:30.548 --> 06:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
which year in assessment is the best fit
 
06:16:32.830 --> 06:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
for their family whether it be a
 
06:16:35.150 --> 06:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
standardized test or an annual portfolio
 
06:16:37.548 --> 06:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
review do not remove these assessment
 
06:16:39.868 --> 06:16:39.878 align:start position:0%
options from families please vote
 
06:16:42.230 --> 06:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you thank
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
06:16:46.230 --> 06:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
from the committee thank you all right
 
06:16:49.110 --> 06:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
may I pass this into somebody yes yes

uh I currently homeschool my son um I
 
06:17:14.350 --> 06:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
don't do that as a choice I do it
 
06:17:16.788 --> 06:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
because uh he has a rare genetic
 
06:17:18.590 --> 06:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
disorder and public school does not work
 
06:17:20.788 --> 06:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
for him tests do not work for him and he
 
06:17:22.390 --> 06:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
is just a little bit different than
 
06:17:23.868 --> 06:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
everyone we knew he was different as
 
06:17:26.030 --> 06:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
soon as he was like 3 years old on the
 
06:17:28.230 --> 06:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
soccer field um but he doesn't fit into
 
06:17:31.788 --> 06:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
any bucket of specific diagnosis um it
 
06:17:34.350 --> 06:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
took us 3 years of testing to find out
 
06:17:36.510 --> 06:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
what was wrong with him I always say
 
06:17:37.750 --> 06:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
what was wrong with him because he has
 
06:17:40.628 --> 06:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
many gifts because of this
 
06:17:43.190 --> 06:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
um we have money we moved here from New
 
06:17:44.548 --> 06:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
York because we knew that New York
 
06:17:46.990 --> 06:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
schools would fail my son um we came up
 
06:17:48.510 --> 06:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
here and we said New Hampshire because
 
06:17:51.070 --> 06:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
we like the Live Free or Die attitude we
 
06:17:54.510 --> 06:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
love the Clean Air and um outdoors and
 
06:17:55.788 --> 06:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
you know the ruggedness that comes in
 
06:17:57.350 --> 06:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
the school we love our school district
 
06:17:59.310 --> 06:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
we live in Ashland they did everything
 
06:18:01.350 --> 06:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
they could for my son and when he was in
 
06:18:02.750 --> 06:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
first grade it was great but when he
 
06:18:04.030 --> 06:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
entered second grade things went
 
06:18:05.590 --> 06:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
downhill really fast I don't know what
 
06:18:07.070 --> 06:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
happened to my son but he basically had
 
06:18:09.030 --> 06:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
a complete nervous breakdown he was in
 
06:18:10.948 --> 06:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
and out of doctor's offices for about a
 
06:18:12.788 --> 06:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
year he couldn't leave the house he was
 
06:18:14.868 --> 06:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
freaking out well six months and then
 
06:18:16.788 --> 06:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
summer came and he was fine he was fine
 
06:18:18.830 --> 06:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
like the whole summer back to himself we
 
06:18:20.390 --> 06:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was school cuz school
 
06:18:22.350 --> 06:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
was something that he actually enjoyed
 
06:18:24.628 --> 06:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
but he also didn't enjoy it um because
 
06:18:27.190 --> 06:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
he just can't sit still in a room or
 
06:18:30.110 --> 06:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
take tests um or listen or do a lot of
 
06:18:31.430 --> 06:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
other things that actually make him a
 
06:18:33.110 --> 06:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
really big pain in the butt to be home
 
06:18:36.030 --> 06:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
all the time so I just want to say it
 
06:18:38.670 --> 06:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
cost me $100 to be here today to speak
 
06:18:41.230 --> 06:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
about this because he's not in school
 
06:18:42.708 --> 06:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
every single day I have to be with my
 
06:18:46.110 --> 06:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
son this cost me a lot it cost me my
 
06:18:49.230 --> 06:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
heart it cost me my time they cost time
 
06:18:50.548 --> 06:18:50.558 align:start position:0%
with my other
 
06:18:52.948 --> 06:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
children I love my son I do it because
 
06:18:55.230 --> 06:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
it's right for him I have the money to
 
06:18:56.350 --> 06:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
do it
 
06:18:58.270 --> 06:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
I can spend the $100 to be here but you
 
06:19:00.708 --> 06:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
know who can the educational Freedom
 
06:19:03.190 --> 06:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
families who probably also have children
 
06:19:05.150 --> 06:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
like my son and so while a lot of people
 
06:19:06.310 --> 06:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
have been speaking here about
 
06:19:08.990 --> 06:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooling today and not receiving
 
06:19:10.948 --> 06:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
funds so we shouldn't be tested I don't
 
06:19:12.548 --> 06:19:12.558 align:start position:0%
think anyone should be if you're
 
06:19:15.910 --> 06:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
homeschooling your kid that's 10 weeks
 
06:19:18.030 --> 06:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
for that $5,000 10 weeks you would have
 
06:19:20.390 --> 06:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
a babysitting Public Schools why it's
 
06:19:22.788 --> 06:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
much easier it is much easier to do
 
06:19:25.150 --> 06:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
Public School your time is up oh thank
 
06:19:26.670 --> 06:19:26.680 align:start position:0%

anecdotal evidence if uh there's any
 
06:20:48.750 --> 06:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
room for it so I oppose this bill and

Wendell good afternoon uh my name is Dan
 
06:21:24.590 --> 06:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
wandell I'm from we New Hampshire this
 
06:21:26.150 --> 06:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
is my son August
 
06:21:28.628 --> 06:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
um August is a uh one of four
 
06:21:31.510 --> 06:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
homeschooled children we are um
 
06:21:34.548 --> 06:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
independent unfunded um but frankly you
 
06:21:36.430 --> 06:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
know based on the testimony today as
 
06:21:38.670 --> 06:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
well as um you know sort of being in the
 
06:21:41.590 --> 06:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
homeschool experience and Adventure um
 
06:21:44.110 --> 06:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
the uh imposition
 
06:21:47.990 --> 06:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
of of standardized testing or regulatory
 
06:21:50.310 --> 06:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
framework on top of homeschooling in
 
06:21:52.350 --> 06:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
general is something we vly opposeed
 
06:21:54.868 --> 06:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
whether um those tests are assessed onto
 
06:21:56.468 --> 06:21:56.478 align:start position:0%
independent home schoolers who do not
 
06:21:58.910 --> 06:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
receive funds um or folks who are
 
06:22:02.190 --> 06:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers themselves who are essentially
 
06:22:05.390 --> 06:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
um you know using their own money to um
 
06:22:08.190 --> 06:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
educate their children uh as as they see
 
06:22:11.390 --> 06:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
fit in the EFA program um I I would not
 
06:22:14.310 --> 06:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
distinguish the um the imposition of
 
06:22:18.670 --> 06:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
testing on anyone um to be uh something
 
06:22:20.270 --> 06:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
that would produce better outcomes
 
06:22:22.310 --> 06:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
something that would um you know
 
06:22:25.830 --> 06:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
properly uh assess uh students ability
 
06:22:29.150 --> 06:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
to sort of learn um or um make progress
 
06:22:31.310 --> 06:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
throughout their lives um as has been
 
06:22:34.910 --> 06:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
echoed um we are um you know transplants
 
06:22:37.510 --> 06:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
we we come from um from Massachusetts we
 
06:22:39.868 --> 06:22:39.878 align:start position:0%
specifically sought out New Hampshire um
 
06:22:41.670 --> 06:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
because of its um you know its
 
06:22:45.270 --> 06:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
friendliness towards Liberty um its um
 
06:22:47.548 --> 06:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
instincts towards um you know the
 
06:22:51.430 --> 06:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
sovereignty of individuals to um uh you
 
06:22:53.230 --> 06:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
know have sovereignty over their own
 
06:22:54.670 --> 06:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
lives and particularly the lives of
 
06:22:57.708 --> 06:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
their children um what standardization
 
06:22:59.990 --> 06:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
and what regulation does is is you know
 
06:23:02.350 --> 06:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
diminishes you know the the free spirit
 
06:23:04.350 --> 06:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
and ability to to pursue your own your
 
06:23:07.510 --> 06:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
own destiny um what assessments do is
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change the relationship
 
06:23:11.548 --> 06:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
between the state and the individual and
 
06:23:14.150 --> 06:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change um the relationship
 
06:23:16.670 --> 06:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
between you know parents and children um
 
06:23:19.070 --> 06:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
obviously in and in position of of
 
06:23:21.750 --> 06:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
standardized testing creates a c
 
06:23:24.030 --> 06:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum in and of its stealth um you
 
06:23:25.830 --> 06:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
know I have you know August is a is a
 
06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
hunter a fisherman he's our sort of
 
06:23:30.150 --> 06:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
Junior ornithologist he can name more
 
06:23:32.948 --> 06:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
birds than you know than you think exist
 
06:23:35.070 --> 06:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
um and that's a direct result of his
 
06:23:37.628 --> 06:23:37.638 align:start position:0%
mother teaching him in uh in the manner
 
06:23:39.868 --> 06:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
that we deem appropriate um there is no
 
06:23:42.110 --> 06:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
standardized test that would capture
 
06:23:45.468 --> 06:23:45.478 align:start position:0%
that ability um there is no um you know
 
06:23:47.708 --> 06:23:47.718 align:start position:0%
regulation that would produce a better
 
06:23:50.750 --> 06:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
outcome from for him or um or his
 
06:23:52.670 --> 06:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
siblings um I would urge the committee
 
06:23:54.868 --> 06:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
to listen to the testimony that's been
 
06:23:56.670 --> 06:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's been brought I I don't believe
 
06:23:59.910 --> 06:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
there is any um opposition um that
 
06:24:03.030 --> 06:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
exists among the public to um to
 
06:24:05.830 --> 06:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
striking down this bill in committee um
 
06:24:07.548 --> 06:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
and again your your time is up great

06:24:31.310 --> 06:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:36.788 --> 06:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
here hi I'm Michelle doen I'm I'm from P
 
06:24:39.868 --> 06:24:39.878 align:start position:0%
I've been teaching H school I guess
 
06:24:44.070 --> 06:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded um for six years now uh I teach
 
06:24:47.190 --> 06:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
in a fail tolearn kind of way I don't
 
06:24:48.670 --> 06:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
really believe in testing I like to
 
06:24:48.680 --> 06:24:50.270 align:start position:0%
really believe in testing I like to
teach

06:24:50.270 --> 06:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
teach
 
06:24:52.230 --> 06:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
conversationally my son was in school
 
06:24:55.030 --> 06:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
till third grade and ended up leaving
 
06:24:55.040 --> 06:24:56.350 align:start position:0%
till third grade and ended up leaving
there

06:24:56.350 --> 06:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:24:59.350 --> 06:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
after that kind of testing environment
 
06:25:01.830 --> 06:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
calling himself stupid and took years
 
06:25:04.830 --> 06:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
before he built the confidence to um
 
06:25:08.548 --> 06:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
learn love love learning again uh so now
 
06:25:10.150 --> 06:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
I've taught over a hundred different
 
06:25:12.830 --> 06:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
types of learn um topics of learning we
 
06:25:15.468 --> 06:25:15.478 align:start position:0%
do dexterity based learning and a lot of
 
06:25:18.190 --> 06:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
kids will come in with the mindset that
 
06:25:20.990 --> 06:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
they have to pass or fail that if they
 
06:25:22.548 --> 06:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
don't leave with something in their
 
06:25:24.670 --> 06:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
hands that they failed and I like to
 
06:25:26.468 --> 06:25:26.478 align:start position:0%
teach them that that it's inside of you
 
06:25:29.150 --> 06:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
that we build the skill and that's
 
06:25:31.468 --> 06:25:31.478 align:start position:0%
enough um but you can even see in their
 
06:25:33.948 --> 06:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
eyes that they're terrified to do the
 
06:25:36.708 --> 06:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
thing wrong and so I spend my time on
 
06:25:37.788 --> 06:25:37.798 align:start position:0%
making that
 
06:25:39.948 --> 06:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
mindset which is actually kind of
 
06:25:43.110 --> 06:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
difficult but they're young uh so in
 
06:25:45.708 --> 06:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
everything I do that's the goal uh so I
 
06:25:47.430 --> 06:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
don't believe in testing I don't think
 
06:25:49.430 --> 06:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
that that's the way you gain things and
 
06:25:50.830 --> 06:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
I don't really think that that's how we
 
06:25:53.830 --> 06:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
get to know what kids know and I don't
 
06:25:56.350 --> 06:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
think that's how we build a love for
 
06:25:58.990 --> 06:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
learning um it's really important that
 
06:26:02.468 --> 06:26:02.478 align:start position:0%
we remove that teaching to ATT test is
 
06:26:03.868 --> 06:26:03.878 align:start position:0%
the way that we should do things because
 
06:26:06.190 --> 06:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's not really how we operate in life
 
06:26:07.788 --> 06:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
that's not how we've operated any other
 
06:26:10.270 --> 06:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
time in life except for right now
 
06:26:13.110 --> 06:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
testing to to know what kids know and
 
06:26:15.750 --> 06:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
since we've ever been people um I think
 
06:26:17.910 --> 06:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's ridiculous the public school is
 
06:26:20.670 --> 06:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
failing so that's a good way to assess
 
06:26:22.788 --> 06:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
that to be honest and to do it to kids
 
06:26:25.310 --> 06:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
overall when many kids just don't
 
06:26:28.510 --> 06:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
operate in that kind of way um to do it
 
06:26:31.110 --> 06:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
to them all it seems ridiculous to me so
 
06:26:32.590 --> 06:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing your insights and
 
06:26:35.150 --> 06:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
your understanding yeah thanks uh any
 
06:26:36.670 --> 06:26:36.680 align:start position:0%

she uh Joyce

Allen might be getting some people
 
06:27:02.548 --> 06:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:06.468 --> 06:27:06.478 align:start position:0%
hallway Kate Shay maybe oh Kate

06:27:16.670 --> 06:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:20.868 --> 06:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
tea okay yes come on up Kate good
 
06:27:22.788 --> 06:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you committee thank you
 
06:27:25.310 --> 06:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Kate Shay from Goffstown y'all
 
06:27:26.830 --> 06:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
have heard me a number of times I'll try
 
06:27:28.270 --> 06:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
to keep it really short because people
 
06:27:30.510 --> 06:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
have covered most of the points you all
 
06:27:32.590 --> 06:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
know from prior uh discussions we've had
 
06:27:34.990 --> 06:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
I have four kids three of special needs
 
06:27:37.468 --> 06:27:37.478 align:start position:0%
um my mother was a public school teacher
 
06:27:39.788 --> 06:27:39.798 align:start position:0%
for her whole career and in the end she
 
06:27:41.708 --> 06:27:41.718 align:start position:0%
ended up leaving her career in her
 
06:27:43.030 --> 06:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
retirement because she just could not
 
06:27:44.670 --> 06:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
read out of a manual she did not want to
 
06:27:46.548 --> 06:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
be teaching to tests and I didn't
 
06:27:47.868 --> 06:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
believe that this was really happening
 
06:27:49.628 --> 06:27:49.638 align:start position:0%
in New York state till my nie started to
 
06:27:51.868 --> 06:27:51.878 align:start position:0%
encounter it as well and would be crying
 
06:27:54.230 --> 06:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
super smart girls be crying over these
 
06:27:55.990 --> 06:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
tests and so kind of could see what was
 
06:27:58.548 --> 06:27:58.558 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire but inevitably
 
06:28:00.868 --> 06:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
it did come and after many years of me
 
06:28:04.750 --> 06:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
trying to fit my kids into the system uh
 
06:28:06.590 --> 06:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
I gave up and actually it was one of the
 
06:28:08.510 --> 06:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
best things I ever did some people might
 
06:28:10.190 --> 06:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
look at as giving up I love what she
 
06:28:13.070 --> 06:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
said about um failing to learn that's
 
06:28:15.310 --> 06:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
what I do for my job day in the day so I
 
06:28:17.190 --> 06:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
work with software Engineers we fail to
 
06:28:19.590 --> 06:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
learn which sounds counterproductive to
 
06:28:22.110 --> 06:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do but in essence
 
06:28:23.708 --> 06:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
you know it it goes against the grain
 
06:28:25.350 --> 06:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
and so it takes a lot of my coaching it
 
06:28:26.868 --> 06:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of a teacher kind of
 
06:28:28.830 --> 06:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
attitude to get them to try it and when
 
06:28:31.150 --> 06:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
we do that's when we have breakthroughs
 
06:28:33.670 --> 06:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
um so I asked myself what what's
 
06:28:35.510 --> 06:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
happened at State assessments since I
 
06:28:37.310 --> 06:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
went to school and I was one of those
 
06:28:38.948 --> 06:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
circling whatever little bubble there
 
06:28:40.670 --> 06:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
was and having a good old time not
 
06:28:42.390 --> 06:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
caring about exactly what it was doing
 
06:28:44.910 --> 06:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
to my test scores but essentially as we
 
06:28:47.190 --> 06:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
know they're here to inform future
 
06:28:50.030 --> 06:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
instruction to evaluate Mastery so I'd
 
06:28:52.150 --> 06:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
like to ask you today are these things
 
06:28:54.270 --> 06:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
really providing a litmus test to
 
06:28:57.628 --> 06:28:57.638 align:start position:0%
Mastery or not so we've talked about you
 
06:29:00.030 --> 06:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
know there's already a portfolio review
 
06:29:01.830 --> 06:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
or an option to do a standardized test
 
06:29:03.230 --> 06:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
for the EFA students I'm going to speak
 
06:29:05.830 --> 06:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
about EFA because a couple of my kids um
 
06:29:07.868 --> 06:29:07.878 align:start position:0%
actually leveraged that and we were
 
06:29:11.030 --> 06:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
finally able to pass the the income
 
06:29:14.510 --> 06:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
level and and be eligible um a lot of
 
06:29:16.430 --> 06:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
students opt out to these tests so I
 
06:29:19.150 --> 06:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
have three neurodiverse kids they would
 
06:29:21.150 --> 06:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
be making designs out of the bubbles on
 
06:29:22.990 --> 06:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
the paper I can tell you that much you
 
06:29:24.948 --> 06:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
know and they're off the charts and
 
06:29:27.548 --> 06:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
intelligence you know um a lot of kids
 
06:29:28.708 --> 06:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
op out I'm going to leave you with some
 
06:29:30.990 --> 06:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
statistics from gtown um actually
 
06:29:33.510 --> 06:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's 211% it says with a disability
 
06:29:35.948 --> 06:29:35.958 align:start position:0%
in the student body of about 2,000
 
06:29:39.230 --> 06:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
students and 60% of them took the
 
06:29:41.990 --> 06:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
alternative standardized test but but
 
06:29:45.150 --> 06:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
only 60% so where's the other 40 is what
 
06:29:49.510 --> 06:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
I would ask um your time is okay let me
 
06:29:51.310 --> 06:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
wrap it up by just asking you to look at
 
06:29:53.150 --> 06:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
these stats when you get a chance just
 
06:29:55.390 --> 06:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
from one district and ask ask yourself
 
06:29:57.270 --> 06:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
if this is actually providing value is
 
06:29:59.548 --> 06:29:59.558 align:start position:0%
is this worth $2.5 million or do we
 
06:30:02.590 --> 06:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
already have a way to prove learning
 
06:30:05.708 --> 06:30:05.718 align:start position:0%
we're showing 50% proficiency on gostone
 
06:30:06.910 --> 06:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
and year-over-year we're actually
 
06:30:09.350 --> 06:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
declining so I would ask is this the
 
06:30:11.910 --> 06:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
best use of our money and our time and
 
06:30:13.310 --> 06:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
putting these students through this I
 
06:30:16.030 --> 06:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
ask you humbly to reject and oppose this
 
06:30:18.990 --> 06:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you very much
 
06:30:21.468 --> 06:30:21.478 align:start position:0%
represent Cordell do want to answer a
 
06:30:24.310 --> 06:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
question you yeah thank you uh for
 
06:30:25.948 --> 06:30:25.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question question we've had
 
06:30:29.070 --> 06:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
several homeschool parents talk about um
 
06:30:31.990 --> 06:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
having children with um special needs
 
06:30:36.270 --> 06:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and you said you had three and um
 
06:30:39.230 --> 06:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
we've heard very often that really for
 
06:30:41.788 --> 06:30:41.798 align:start position:0%
parents with children with special needs
 
06:30:45.350 --> 06:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
the only place that there can be
 
06:30:47.628 --> 06:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
advancement um and learning for those
 
06:30:49.590 --> 06:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
children is in a public school where
 
06:30:51.548 --> 06:30:51.558 align:start position:0%
they can get the services how are your
 
06:30:54.070 --> 06:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
children making out outside of the
 
06:30:56.788 --> 06:30:56.798 align:start position:0%
public school they don't need Services
 
06:30:58.910 --> 06:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
anymore they don't need those Services
 
06:31:00.670 --> 06:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
they were not adding value in fact one
 
06:31:02.270 --> 06:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
of the services actually told my son
 
06:31:04.590 --> 06:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
that telling a white Li is actually okay
 
06:31:07.030 --> 06:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
in speech therapy so those Services as
 
06:31:08.468 --> 06:31:08.478 align:start position:0%
we got looking at them were not really
 
06:31:10.430 --> 06:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
Services they were actually disservices
 
06:31:13.070 --> 06:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
to us and you're able to provide these
 
06:31:14.110 --> 06:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
things you can get them through your
 
06:31:15.750 --> 06:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
insurance if you really need to go after
 
06:31:17.430 --> 06:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
we did actually at one point use
 
06:31:19.270 --> 06:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy but we did it
 
06:31:20.510 --> 06:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
through our insurance we were able to
 
06:31:22.590 --> 06:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
get hippotherapy for I actually had a
 
06:31:24.150 --> 06:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
child very much like this lady in the
 
06:31:26.708 --> 06:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
back who felt fell apart and he also
 
06:31:28.190 --> 06:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
acquired a brain illness at the same
 
06:31:30.628 --> 06:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
time I almost lost him but I was able to
 
06:31:33.388 --> 06:31:33.398 align:start position:0%
do that through my insurance um there's
 
06:31:35.350 --> 06:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
no other reason once we changed the
 
06:31:37.150 --> 06:31:37.160 align:start position:0%
setting they didn't have the other
 
06:31:38.990 --> 06:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
problems it was never a problem of
 
06:31:41.150 --> 06:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
intelligence it was a problem of the
 
06:31:43.750 --> 06:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
environment so we don't need we don't
 
06:31:46.150 --> 06:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
need Services we're actually providing
 
06:31:48.070 --> 06:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to create
 
06:31:50.350 --> 06:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
independent adults who are already
 
06:31:53.350 --> 06:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
preparing at 14 for college and they're
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
not going to be on the state St
 
06:31:58.388 --> 06:31:58.398 align:start position:0%
so I would say you know not only is the
 
06:32:01.750 --> 06:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
2.5 unnecessary but we're saving money
 
06:32:03.830 --> 06:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
by allowing these students to meet the
 
06:32:06.070 --> 06:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements and have a
 
06:32:08.548 --> 06:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
chance thank you thank you further
 
06:32:11.190 --> 06:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Tanner thank
 
06:32:13.590 --> 06:32:13.600 align:start position:0%

06:32:15.548 --> 06:32:15.558 align:start position:0%
like or or are you talking about your
 
06:32:17.510 --> 06:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
own children oh I'm talking about my own
 
06:32:20.030 --> 06:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
children thank you it's not a bad idea
 
06:32:21.910 --> 06:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
though thank
 
06:32:24.030 --> 06:32:24.040 align:start position:0%

06:32:26.948 --> 06:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thanks is
 
06:32:35.150 --> 06:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:40.868 --> 06:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:43.708 --> 06:32:43.718 align:start position:0%
here welcome thank you good afternoon
 
06:32:45.830 --> 06:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm Chandler Gable I'm a homeschooling
 
06:32:47.750 --> 06:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
dad from Manchester we traditional
 
06:32:50.628 --> 06:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
unfunded homeschoolers and uh I urge you
 
06:32:53.070 --> 06:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
to reject this bill uh at its core
 
06:32:54.990 --> 06:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooling is about diversity I
 
06:32:56.548 --> 06:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill puts that
 
06:32:59.230 --> 06:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
diversity severely at risk I have two
 
06:33:01.788 --> 06:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
boys they're 11 and eight currently
 
06:33:04.350 --> 06:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
they're thriving using a classical uh
 
06:33:07.350 --> 06:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum that teaches them math uh
 
06:33:11.190 --> 06:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
Science History Latin writing and more
 
06:33:12.990 --> 06:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh my oldest loves putting together
 
06:33:14.670 --> 06:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
engineering projects he's learned to
 
06:33:18.230 --> 06:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
build his own bookcase um he's uh he you
 
06:33:20.670 --> 06:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
know he writes a great essay and both he
 
06:33:22.070 --> 06:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
and my youngest are very interested in
 
06:33:23.468 --> 06:33:23.478 align:start position:0%
owning their own business so I've got
 
06:33:26.110 --> 06:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
them putting together business
 
06:33:28.590 --> 06:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
plans what I want to emphasize is that
 
06:33:30.310 --> 06:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have time to do all this
 
06:33:33.110 --> 06:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
with them if we were also forced to
 
06:33:35.350 --> 06:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
teach to a test if there's a
 
06:33:36.948 --> 06:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
standardized test that they have to take
 
06:33:38.788 --> 06:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year that's going to
 
06:33:40.110 --> 06:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
determine whether we can continue
 
06:33:42.310 --> 06:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
homeschooling them we won't have time to
 
06:33:44.868 --> 06:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
do these wonderful things that that are
 
06:33:48.270 --> 06:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
so meaningful and so beneficial to them
 
06:33:50.708 --> 06:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
um I also want to point out that my
 
06:33:53.150 --> 06:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
program looks nothing like the uh
 
06:33:54.590 --> 06:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
homeschooling program of some of my
 
06:33:56.388 --> 06:33:56.398 align:start position:0%
friends and that's okay you know it's
 
06:33:58.230 --> 06:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
just one beam of light in this Broad and
 
06:34:01.350 --> 06:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
diverse rainbow that is uh you know wide
 
06:34:03.468 --> 06:34:03.478 align:start position:0%
enough to Encompass the unique needs of
 
06:34:07.030 --> 06:34:07.040 align:start position:0%

06:34:09.750 --> 06:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
