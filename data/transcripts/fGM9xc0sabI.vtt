00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
call the division to uh meeting to
 
00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
order and invite the Lottery Commission
 
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
Folks up to talk about the lottery
 
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
budget and perhaps after you introduce
 
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
yourselves you could tell us how you're
 
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to go through so people that are
 
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
watching might understand where the flow
 
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 align:start position:0%
following okay um good afternoon Mr
 
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee um my
 
00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
name is Charlie McIntyre I'm the
 
00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
director of the Hampshire lottery I've
 
00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
had the privilege of being that for
 
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
almost 15 years now uh and with me today
 
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
is my colleague our Chief Financial
 
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
Officer Jim durus um essentially Mr
 
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
chairman if it please the committee I
 
00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
was going to go through a very brief
 
00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
couple of slides to present both what is
 
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
our graph of our revenues versus
 
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
expenses and then obviously our revenues
 
00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
by product um and then uh obviously
 
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
explain briefly each of the products we
 
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.589 align:start position:0%
explain briefly each of the products we
sell

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
sell
 
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
and then um answer any questions I don't
 
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
expect this to be a long process I know
 
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
you folks may have a lot of questions
 
00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 align:start position:0%
given the nature of what we do and how
 
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
we do it and why um well I know the why
 
00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 align:start position:0%
it's money
 
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
U um but I I our budget is very simple
 
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
so that's essentially the process Mr
 
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
chairman if you want me to
 
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
proceed sure did you bring some tickets
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
fors par did you bring some tickets for
 
00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
us then you would have to file paper
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I was going to say you you got to
 
00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
ask ahead of time you really you just
 
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
got no please proceed of course um
 
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
certainly a very basic the first slot
 
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
obviously is an introductory one the
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
second one is um essentially our
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
expenses and profitability over the last
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
decade um and I can say actually going
 
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
back further when I first started at New
 
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lottery in 2011 our return to
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund of $62 million in
 
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
FY 24 it was 207 million so we have more
 
00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
than tripled uh the net profitability to
 
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
the state and as you see the expenses
 
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
they virtually remain flat the entire
 
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
time um and as you can
 
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
imagine we run very much like a
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
business our divisions are very much set
 
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
up like business divisions sales
 
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
marketing Security Finance uh we have a
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
compliance Department um investigations
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
and enforcement department uh and so
 
00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
it's set very much like a business to
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
run like a business and as you folks
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
well know we are the I don't know if
 
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
we're the most audited agency in the
 
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
state but we're close if we're not um
 
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
annually the LBA audit team is there for
 
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
five months a year and they do our they
 
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
go over our books um they review our
 
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
annual report which is this
 
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
document um which um we don't send to
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
everybody because it's a lot of paper um
 
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
but it's available on our website uh
 
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
which I think was I just probably
 
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
hijacked your question Mr chairman no I
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
just to say I think it's also available
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the LBA website yeah and
 
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
certainly they audit and um if you're
 
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
interested next month we go before uh
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal for our um review of the findings
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
the um lb audit team had so uh our
 
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
numbers are scrubbed as M as the most of
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
any agency in the state um rightfully so
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
didn't we already see you this year you
 
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
received yeah the report but there's a
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up management letter ah okay that
 
00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
comes uh and there's a few findings I'll
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
look forward to
 
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
that I would point out that none of them
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
relate to actually the finances as our
 
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
CFO would be happy to point out but none
 
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
relate to the actual the math of things
 
00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
um uh and so certainly one of the points
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
I try and raise particularly with house
 
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
finance and Senate Finance is um while
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
revenues and expenses are two different
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
committees they're two sides of the same
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
C point and so please when you what you
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
do here impacts Revenue down the hall to
 
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
your colleagues and so that's one of the
 
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
reasons I asked you to review this slide
 
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
and certainly contained within the
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
governor's budget is an increased
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimate for FY uh 26 and 27
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
$185 million which is a little over 12
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
million more annually than had been in
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
the uh Revenue estimates for house
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
andent Ways and Means from the fall of
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
last year and so we we've raised
 
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
guidance essentially someone reading
 
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
this wrong it looks like your revenues
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
are going down in the next in the next
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
few years so the revenues are going down
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
so two so FY 24 was an absolute high
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
water mark where everything hit
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
perfectly great and what I mean by that
 
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
is we had annual sales of Powerball our
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
record year far and away because we had
 
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
a record number of billion dooll
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
jackpots and the reason we had a record
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
number of billion dollar jackpots is
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
because interest rates went up so the
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
jackpot size is a function of the amount
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
of cash we have on hand multiplied by a
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
bond factor which is interest rate
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
driven equals jackpot size so where that
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
ratio is usually 1.4 1.5 so cash in hand
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
times 1.4 it was 2.2 2.3 2.4 and so we
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
had a number of billion- dollar jackpots
 
00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
which is great for
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
marketing uh and we are you know I'm
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
proud to say the number one jurisdiction
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
in the country for Powerball sales per
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
what but it's certainly a source of
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
Pride because everyone sells that ticket
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
the same way across the country and the
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
fact that we do it the best is an
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
obviously a matter of Pride for the
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
staff and um kudos to the folks that I
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
we work with um but it was a perfect
 
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
storm and we're the number one at it and
 
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 align:start position:0%
so there was a large profitability and
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
every Powerball ticket we sell 40 cents
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
that is profit so so every dollar 40
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
cents is profit so for us it's our
 
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
highest margin ticket we sell uh and so
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
a dollar there is worth two and change
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
in a scratch ticket sale so that's why
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
it's our sales are going up it's just in
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
what we make the most profit in is going
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
down through no fault of ours it's just
 
00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:51.879 align:start position:0%
the nature of Powerball it's jackpots
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars are like three
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
foot snow storms they show up when they
 
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
show up I can't the ping pong balls
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
don't have a memory I can't affect them
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
um and so that's our Revenue um picture
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
for the next two years and the remainder
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
of this year and obviously the last
 
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
slide is a breakdown of or the second
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
last slide is a breakdown of where our
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
sales come
 
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
from and as you can see majority of our
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
gross sales still come from scratch
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
tickets um but containing within this
 
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
graph and within the table within it is
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
um essentially all of our revenue
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll pause for any questions at this
 
00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
point this is represent papovich thank
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for being
 
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
here um is that gross revenue or the um
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
net you know the profit sure it's
 
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
actually a it's it's a gross revenue but
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
in some cases like for scratch tickets
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
this is gross revenue before prizes are
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
paid out and in the case of um
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
pardon an i lottering sports betting
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's net of prizes before expenses are
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
factored in if I mean I don't know how
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
much extra work would it be to also have
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
a similar chart with the you know
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
profits per game let's say leaving out
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
the you know budget that you actually
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
spend the 11 million whatever you pay
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
for staff never mind that overhead
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
because there is no point in allocating
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
it but just in terms of the gross profit
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
per product yeah it's certainly I'm sure
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere in a report yeah it is I
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
mean certainly we don't break out uh as
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
you can imagine we try
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
in cross product staff so a number of
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
like my colleague here Jim does the
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
finances for all the buildings so I
 
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
don't factor out him but certainly we
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
can get you a close approximation
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
representative of what it is profit per
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
um product line um as a as
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
a yeah you write that down s forget it
 
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
yeah page
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
4 Page
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
4 suiz oh okay actually my if look at
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
page 42 of the in report on our website
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
U it does a
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
breakdown no followup needed we're good
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
with that thank you all
 
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.790 align:start position:0%
with that thank you all
right

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and certainly um the gross sales have
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
gone up dramatically since 10 years ago
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
we were around $250 million in gross
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
sales now it's 633 million in gross
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
sales and it will continue to go up
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to bring your attention to
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs that we put in for
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
the budget and uh certainly the for the
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration of um putting
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
it back in the budget one is to update
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
our security system which is outdated
 
00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:41.509 align:start position:0%
our security system which is outdated
and

00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
um it's not compatible with our existing
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I think the cameras are
 
00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
running on Windows 7 if I'm not
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
mistaken um which has has no longer been
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
patched since 2012 maybe
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
15 okay yeah
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh and it runs its own PC uh
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
in its own server its own house because
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's older um and then
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
um obviously upgrades to our ex um
 
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
entrance way to make it more ADA
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
Compliant it's not particularly ADA
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
Compliant the door is too hard to open
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
and the the ramp is not perfect uh and
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
so those are just two needs we have I
 
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
mean there were a number of needs that
 
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
were met in the budget um but those two
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh were additional as well
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
um to be sure I think our budget is
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
straightforward um so before you go
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
beyond that sure so you're running a
 
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
single IBM Windows 7 machine right now
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
correct that's running the security
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
system the rest of the the rest of the
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
operation is based on oit it's through
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
oit and that that's up to date but the
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
security system is running off a single
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
server managing uh um the cameras that
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
surveil the building your own building
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
correct our own building yes oh what do
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
you need those for pardon what do you
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
need that for you don't any money there
 
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.990 align:start position:0%
need that for you don't any money there
do

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
you no it's it's gold bars in the
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
basement so um we have neighbors who
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
have set up camp in a abandoned lot next
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
to us and in some cases it varies
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
between five and 50 um homeless folks
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
who um come visit our building uh use
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
our water spigot um and I we did not as
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
a matter of courtesy and just out of
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
humanity um did not put a lock on the
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
spigot it's August I'm not going to let
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
these folks die Heats you know heat
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
stroke because we don't so um but you
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
know we do need security for the
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
building itself people do think honest
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
to God we had a jackpot of I think it
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
was half a billion dollars and it was
 
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
400 million in cash and I swear they
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
thought that we had the money in the
 
00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.870 align:start position:0%
thought that we had the money in the
building

00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
like where do you keep that money I'm
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
like you know what in a lock room yeah
 
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
okay but but on a serious note because I
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
actually I'm a Macintosh guy but I have
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
to have a PC for some stuff that I do
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm like you I'm way back there yeah
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
since it's only controlling your cameras
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
what what's the what's your concern
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
about having the fact that the software
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
is out of date it's G to die eventually
 
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
I mean certainly we had two old
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
firewalls that run our um run our
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
firewalls and the servers and they were
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
both 10 years old we turned them off and
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
they both died immediately so clearly
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
there was embedded in that firewall a
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
kill after so many years because we
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to sell them more and so at
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
some point where're fearful it's not
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
going to work okay but when you say
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
firewall the way you just described it
 
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you turned off a router
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
no it was a it was a sorry different
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
different products different so there
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
were firewalls in our computer room this
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
is a different this system is different
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
the surveillance system we're requesting
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
is different thing I my fear is that we
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
turn it off one day move it it won't go
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
back on and then now now the
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance system is dead okay I mean
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
I I I just got to say $100,000 for a PC
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
sounds an awful lot of money I think
 
00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
it's also an upgrade it's excuse me to
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
interrupt that but this would be an
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
upgrade to the whole system it would be
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
getting cameras that aren't 30 years old
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
as well um and fewer cameras than we
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
have now modernizing it getting it into
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
where and one of the risks is when it's
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
on a single PC like this theoretically
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
if something happened and someone took
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
that computer there's no backing up
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
there's nothing on the server to show
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
what happened that night um this is a
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
standalone piece if that computer goes
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
and something
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
happens you have nothing you have
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
nothing to view what happened with it
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
got it but you can buy two PCS for a lot
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
less 100 Grand it's a whole system but
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
and also help me understand what a whole
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
system is you're just controlling a
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
couple of cameras sorry I just your
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
question but um it was also upgrade the
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
front sales office in terms of physical
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
plant um right now the public see inside
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
our buildings through glass doors and um
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
there's no security for the sales office
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
the glass is not Bulletproof the walls
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
aren't bulletproof and uh every so often
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
we have a situation that's remarkably
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable for our sales staff um
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
where one of two things happens one is
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
somebody thinks they won and they didn't
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
win said that again someone thinks they
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
won and they didn't win okay they
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was a one and it's actually a
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
10 or whatever or two and more
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
aggressively is we're required to offset
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
Child Support Enforcement payments so if
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
you are um in a rears in child support
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
and you come and win we have to grab
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
that money even though in some instances
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
you may have already paid it just not
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
has gotten through the system and those
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
folks tend to be
 
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
unhappy fair enough but so how does this
 
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
help that problem so it was U it's both
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
surveillance in terms of the the
 
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
equipment the servers the um cameras but
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
also to add a layer of security to the
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
front office harden up the wall that
 
00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
sits below waste level uh for our
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
employees as well as change the doors to
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
not be clear glass looking into our
 
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
offices so that's not the access that's
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
not the $30,000 piece no that's not is
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
it oh it
 
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
is no no it's ADA
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
is thought it was
 
00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:33.389 align:start position:0%
is thought it was
important

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
sales that system that number is a
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
estimate given to us
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
by was it
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
which 100,000 yeah
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay that Mak be even more suspicious I
 
00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:49.959 align:start position:0%
just got to tell you um well okay you
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
know we're in a tipe budget situation of
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
course anything you can do to yeah but
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely no I apologize for not having
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
a better knowledge of it so not a
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
problem represent
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and again sorry for
 
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
stepping out for a moment I got a phone
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
call that whoever called me should have
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
known better than to call me during a
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
hearing um and they were told that so um
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
I have a different question I'm U you
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
know you started by saying that the you
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
know expenses didn't change that much
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
and uh obviously the graph when you look
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
at the revenues they are very long lines
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the shorter lines
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
and the actual operating expenses from
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
2022 which admittedly is kind of a low
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
Watermark to
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
2025 it's 3 years and a 76% increase in
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
operating expenses now obviously you
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
didn't come here with all the details in
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
that but I would like to have a very
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
thorough understanding of why you know
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
the increases are quite that steep in
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
operating expenses I'm sure you have
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
good reasons I would just like to
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
understand them because as the chairman
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
was saying and frankly we've been saying
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
it to everybody and every it's a tight
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
budget here and
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the many dollars you put
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund but
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
expenses still need to be scrutinized
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
obviously with an eye towards not U you
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
know robbing Peter to pay Paul and
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
saving a dollar in expenses to lose 10
 
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
in Revenue right so we are keenly aware
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
of that but um it is still a sharply
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
climbing year-over-year number from 2022
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
to 2025 projected and we'd really want
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
to understand at least I would want to
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
understand and way more detail on what
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
drives it what is essential and so on
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
and so forth sure certainly if you U
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
remember the negotiate to collect a
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
bargain agreement uh 10% 10% 10% um is
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
that we also added a number of employees
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
because we um the this body and the
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
governor agreed to allow charitable
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
gambling rooms to add historic horse
 
00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
racing and so that now has 20 2400
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
gaming machines in the state and that
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
number is going to increase by 1,500 in
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
the next three weeks so you're talking
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
now 4,000 gaming machines so we have to
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
we increased our regulatory footprint
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
our investigators our licensing
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
footprint I said I'm sure to have good
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
reasons I would just like to better
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
understand the Steep increase right yeah
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
of course some some issues we're aware
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
of some we are not and we need to
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
understand and honestly one of the also
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
things is because we've increased
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
revenues um one of the hard hardest
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
things to do in a businesses scale up
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
obviously and we've increased
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
advertising significantly I think we
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
increased it 20% um over the last budget
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
versus this current bium uh just to
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
support the growth as you can imagine we
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
have a number of
 
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
additional verticals we didn't have 10
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
years ago we have Internet we have
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
sports betting we have
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
um just a number of things we have to
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
add and honestly advertising got more
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
expensive because of the number of
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
channels you can advertise through um
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
you can do so just
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's have full-time folks who nothing
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
but social media because it's a constant
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
stream of of data um our benefits would
 
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.909 align:start position:0%
stream of of data um our benefits would
up

00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
by yes about a simar about payroll and
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
then doit was a significant expense
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
because we are trying to launch a um
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
Salesforce application for the lottery
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
itself to maintain a customer database
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
of folks who call in have issues um up
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
until well still we use pen and paper we
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
use notepads emails texts so and so
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
called we don't have a tracking system
 
00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
of that um and so that was an additional
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
expense as well that was approved in the
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
last Bal budget so um but I could
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
certainly get them line by line
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
representive to your point if you want
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
um but those are the four of the main
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
ones that all derived large and it was
 
00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:58.039 align:start position:0%
meant to support the business and sort
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
of be more customer friendly I
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the color commentary and of
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
course more details and I understand
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's a followup item we didn't I didn't
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
expect you to just no of course you know
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
go into that detail I just want you to
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
know that I would like to yeah of course
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
no and certainly not just discounting
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that expenses matter uh and I
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
can tell you as a in a global sense
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
we've never spent our
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
budget not once not ever have we ever
 
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
spent every dollar that was allocated
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
and it one of the reasons is because the
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
the budgeting purpose here it's really
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
just a paper entry because we spend from
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
our own Revenue stream and so if we
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
don't spend it it means it returns to
 
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
profit and
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
so if we don't think it's going to drive
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue growth we don't spend it and I
 
00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
can suggest you in terms heartily that
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
my colleague to my right is the most
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
conservative spender of money that has
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
ever graced the the good Lord's Earth
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
so like all
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
CFOs did I hear you say you added
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
employees correct we had so when uh well
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
we we've always had the positions that
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
were funded we just filled them when oh
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
they you've had four vacancies correct
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
we've always had vacancies and we just
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
didn't fill them until we needed them
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then we really needed them so no
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
vacancies now well we have vacancies now
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
we have 13 positions
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
vacant and are they funded or unfunded
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
um they're all funded they're all funded
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
and is there any plan
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
to fill
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
them um certainly yes but not as if yet
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to like I said we're going
 
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
through cycles and there are two gaming
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
rooms that are coming online the next
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
three weeks one in Rochester and one in
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
dasua which is very large um and we're
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
trying to get through the operational
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
phase of launching them and then see
 
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
thereafter what's needed in terms of
 
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining them regulating them um so
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes but not by date
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
certain do you have any idea what
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're funded
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
at no funded in terms of well the funded
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
positions they must have a dollar amount
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
Associated oh yeah yeah but I had of
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
honest know they were investigator I
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
think is a labor grade
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
20 sorry okay anyway yeah I think it's
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
23 but they end up being usually for us
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
almost exclusively ex law enforcement
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
from other states sort of retired police
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
officers from other states end up being
 
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.750 align:start position:0%
officers from other states end up being
our

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
investigators represent
 
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how many employees do
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
you have right
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
now we have 84 employees but that
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
currently uh but that includes our three
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so really it's 81
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
employees who are operationally working
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
lottery do they all can I follow up yes
 
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
do they all work in your facility in
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
this facility um so no it's a we have
 
00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:54.039 align:start position:0%
two we have two offices we have the
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
Lottery headquarters which is on
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
integral drive we have a regional office
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
which really houses houses the majority
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
of our investigations and enforcement
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
Division and then we have a number of
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
employees whose job to be on the road
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
you what was the total you
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
gave 81 plus three commission yeah so
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
our commission is really just a board of
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
directors okay so 80 plus you're a
 
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner yeah this they have the
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
title commissioner but really it's not
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
like a real I don't see real they're
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
very real but uh they don't act like
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
other Commissioners um I'm just trying
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
to get an accurate account cuz they you
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
have 93 employees and then you take away
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
13 vacancies that comes to 80 yeah and
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is not an employee or
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
the 81st person they're paid but it's a
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's a stipend it's not like a full-time
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
employee they're paid I think the chair
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
is paid 20,000 and the three two other
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I think get 12,000 in year
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
position carry on uh and certainly no to
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
that point um as you can see from our
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
budget the large increases have been
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
really based around payroll o it uh
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and advertising all of which go
 
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
to support um our our products and
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
certainly um that's all I had Mr
 
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I as you can imagine our budget
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
is very simple we don't get grants we
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't get Federal money we don't get
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
donations it's and that you know I would
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
like to point out that we spend from our
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream so it's not really a
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
budget item if you cut us there's not
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
really a saving somewhere to go
 
00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.190 align:start position:0%
really a saving somewhere to go
someplace

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
else because it'll just go as profit for
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
m to the education trust fund thank you
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
that yeah yeah just so we're clear
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we hear about by the same to
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
I would submit that over the last number
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
of years we've never spent our budget
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
never even come close to spending our
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
budget so we acted like grown-ups so I'd
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
ask that to take it into consideration
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
and not punish us because that's all I
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
um you know record profit growth is not
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
that easy to
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
do so just to inform the committee of
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
how Lottery's budget typically works in
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
the past when doing it in division Ways
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
and Means will come up with a revenue
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
estimate which they've uh gone through
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
that process that is really what's going
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
to impact your bottom line for Education
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
trust fund uh historical
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
practices if you make a reduction in
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
Lottery commissions operating budget
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
here or make an ad like the two that
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
they've requested here that wouldn't
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
change anything we we would look at this
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
as other funds the revenue estimate is
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
done separate so Lottery will provide a
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate to uh Ways and Means
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
and they'll look at it as that's what
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
they'll bring in based on the budget
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
that Lottery asks for so when we if for
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
instance it would be a new practice for
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
this committee which not saying it's
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's in the purview of this committee
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
you can do whatever you want to do if
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
you were to reduce a class line by
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
$50,000 we wouldn't necessarily carry
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
something on the Surplus statement
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
adding $50,000 to the education trust
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
fund how about a million
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
dollars again that's up to the committee
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
if you want to do no I'm just asking
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
would what would you do if even even $5
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
would be up to the committee to do I'm
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
just letting you know historical
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
practice with how we've done the lottery
 
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
budget this committee can do whatever
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
you want to do but I'm just letting you
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
know how it's worked in the past
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair first I want to
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
assure you that we pay close attention
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
to who the grown-ups are in terms of the
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
agencies and we appreciate agencies that
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
show the discipline and we make sure
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
that we don't punish them for not
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
spending their budget by cutting their
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
budget right so we're just talking about
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
what's truly needed and genuinely
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
understanding the needs of the agencies
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate you know everything
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
you guys uh do but second at the end of
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
the day every dollars you guys don't
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
spend whether we recognize it early in
 
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
the budget process or not we'll end up
 
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
you know you know if it doesn't affect
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue right any additional profit will
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
be reflected in the education trust fund
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
which is not the general fund but it's
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
still very real money that goes for real
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
real purposes
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
so in the past uh we may have had a more
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
relaxed thing in terms of the self
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
funding agencies we are trying really
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
hard to look in detail of everybody
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
because every dollar counts it's going
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
to be a really tough budget and I'm sure
 
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:09.519 align:start position:0%
you've heard this a 100 times I don't
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
want this to be more than a
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
1001st but we do appreciate it we are
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
very careful about we ask but this is
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
why we ask so many questions to
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
understand what's reasonable and what's
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
not because the last thing we want to do
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
is kill the goods with the golden eggs
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
right to that point I I appreciate the
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
comment representative and one of the
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
difficult difficulties is is in this
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
budget environment for example we're
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
expecting another slew not
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
slw several other gaming operations to
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
come online during the next bium and
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
so it's a difficult proposition to
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
simultaneously grow and
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
contract and so I have to M and you
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
folks want us to manage and regulate all
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
these rooms and as you as you should and
 
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
so I know asking to fund more positions
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
at the time when other agencies are
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
cutting back is a difficult suggestion
 
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
is just I also want to do my job and our
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
job and regulate these rooms effectively
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
so that certainly there's a there's a
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
rubbing Point somewhere that hits but
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
that's certainly I'd like to
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
mention so I will want you to speak to
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
some of those future things but we'll
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
come back to that representative Murray
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yeah I propo the
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
upcoming bium there are two really big
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
holes here um one is um the slots coming
 
00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
on the I forget what it's called The V
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
whatever they're just slots so there are
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
slots coming on um in her budget um
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
which has not gone to Ways and Means
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone to the house and I'm really
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about this little room here um
 
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with a larger issue and there's
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
a big gap in terms of you know I guess
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
over the bayning there's 127 million 17
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
I think 107 yeah in the second one 100
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
there you're expecting 117 million in
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
2017 the other big hole is the gap
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
between what the governor thinks you're
 
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
going going to do in what ways and means
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
thinks is reasonable those are really
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
really big gaps and so I appreciate some
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
of the concerns about let's you know be
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
consistent or let's be conservative and
 
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:09.559 align:start position:0%
careful with our money um but these are
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
two big gaping holes and how what do you
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
what what are your thoughts on this I'm
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
afraid to say how would you address this
 
00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
because that's not necessarily your job
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
but um how do we reconcile that if I can
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
take the second part
 
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
first um the revenue estimates that are
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
derived and Ways and Means are done by
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
my colleague and I very early in the
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
process and candidly as you can imagine
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
in the fall of last year um we take a
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
very conservative Viewpoint of what we
 
00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
expect revenues to be and
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
so and that updates over time and um the
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
governor and I spoke about Revenue
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
estimates for the out
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
tanium and a couple of things hadn't
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
happened that we anticipated happening
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
one is sports betting launching in
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts hasn't had quite the
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
impact we anticipated on sports betting
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue second more rooms that we
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
anticipated and the large size of them
 
00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:0%
as well as the profitability of them
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
surprised even me like for example the
 
00:31:14.509 --> 00:31:14.519 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing machines we did a
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate that these would be
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
essentially $150 a day gross profit
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
which we all split but we get a take
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
they're actually at $239 per machine per
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
day currently so significantly more than
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
we anticip ipated and so uh when the
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
governor asked you know can we look at
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimates we took another
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
look at them and that's where the number
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
comes from the 185 it doesn't come from
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
the governor it came from us having a
 
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
conversation and coming up with and
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
particularly where this year is ending
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
up I think in terms of plan we're at 168
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
for this year and I think we're trending
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
more like 185
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
186 so as you can
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
imagine it's a very difficult
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
proposition to Revenue estimate out two
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
years when I don't know or my colleague
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what the gas prices are
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
going to be or whether the Middle East
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
is going to blow up or supply chain X or
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
Y is going to be a problem and so it's a
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
we try and error on the side of caution
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
but certainly for us um that's where the
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
185 comes from and in terms of VT
 
00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue I think the disparity is in
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
terms of what the percentage that the
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
state will get as part of its rev share
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
if that activity is authorized So
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
currently under historic horse racing
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
the state and charity split 25% of the
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
revenue and The Operators get 75% under
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget that split would
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
go from to 55% for The Operators and 45%
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
to the state and the Charities so it's a
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
matter of you're getting a larger piece
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
of the pie essentially because the pie
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
itself will grow
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
significantly so sorry that answer your
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
question oh sorry per just as a point of
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
clar clarification though my
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the split between
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and the general
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
fund uh once that um shift and revenue
 
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
distribution happens is that less of the
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
proportion will come to the education
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
trust fund it'll be split 5050 at that
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
point so the my favorite part of my job
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
is we just make the money
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so literally it comes to here in a
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
barrel we drop it off and back away
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
slowly and so how how it get spent by
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
the folks who elected is really as I
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
often say we we don't make policy
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
instruments of policy so um that is for
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
decide represent papovich thank you you
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
were talking and thank you for uh you
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
know answering again all these questions
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about the
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
differences in timing between your
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates that were used by ways
 
00:33:51.159 --> 00:33:51.789 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates that were used by ways
and

00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
means I'm a bit confused because
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
obviously you started early so your
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
original numbers had to be more
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
conservative and less recent but as the
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
governor Works through it doesn't Ways
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
and Means also refine their numbers and
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
then why do we do you do you have any
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
idea as to why do we still have a
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
significant discrepancy because I get it
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
between full estimates and spring
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
estimates but all of them are now
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
February estimates so do you do you have
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
any certainly that's um a matter of us
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
being conservative honestly if I can
 
00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.629 align:start position:0%
being conservative honestly if I can
suggest

00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
the Christmas time period and the time
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
after Christmas are telling us to what
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
we believe revenues would look like for
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
the year uh Christmas is our busiest
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
week week after Christmas is our second
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
busiest week and the weeks thereafter
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
our worst weeks and so um we don't like
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
to change our Revenue estimates through
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
that period and so for us it was a
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
matter of last minute not last minute
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
but certainly the most recent
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
revisitation of it and the fact that we
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
were more comfortable six months seven
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
months through the year than we were two
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
months through the year ESS EV yeah
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's it's a matter of timing and and I
 
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
don't I don't we Jim really doesn't like
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
to overperform promise
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
underperform it's because then because
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
one of the difficulties of this job and
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
I would hearken to this is once you put
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
it in the budget it's already
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
spent like and so if we don't make it
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's an unpleasant conver call call
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
from people like what and so that's
 
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
there's a we share that philosophy where
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
we'd rather have a bit of a safety
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
margin rather than go over the limb and
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
fall off by an inch or two I have been
 
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
in the room with very uncomfortable
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
conversations with governors in the past
 
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
and it's unpleasant I'd rather avoid it
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know just candidly I'd rather not
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah R Mar thank you again uh
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
so you know back to two things your
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
conservative estimates are still I guess
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means is way more conservative
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
than their estimates than you are
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're estimating you know the 12 and
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
your or they're estimating um you're
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
estim ating 12 million more than what
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
way and means so they're when you say
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's a conservative estimate it's like
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
yeah but way and means is more
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
conservative that does not address the
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
Gap and the other thing is can we you
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
Circle back around to actual slot
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
machines I understand the historic
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
racing but this is a major change to go
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
from the historic whatever I don't even
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
understand it to slots okay so the the
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
the conservative estimate is 173 that's
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
ours to Ways and Means and the 185 to us
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
is what we anticipate would be a
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable estimate so it's both of
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
those of our numbers just based on
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
dates yeah and certainly to VTS I would
 
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
not characterize as a major seismic
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
change and the reason I suggest this is
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
because the historic ory
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
machines nothing's going to changes how
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
they look very little the cabling's
 
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
still there the cameras are still there
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
the box is going to look the same it's
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
literally going to be the same box
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
you're just changing out the content
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
within it and the math behind it uh and
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
so it's not a well I understand the the
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
word may sound like their big change if
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
you walked in and on a Monday and they
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
changed it to next Friday you would
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
notice very little difference and it's
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
just the player likes it a lot better um
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
VTS versus HHR and that's for the that's
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
the reason for the revenue estimate and
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
the revenue being
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
raised so are you expecting more people
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
to play or you the same number of people
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
to play on the same machines are you
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
expecting more people to play on the
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
same machines are you expecting how many
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
more machines cuz we're going up to
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
4,000 now if you don't see a big
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
difference between the historic racing
 
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
and the salt machines so I it's a
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
physical difference versus a play
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
difference right and
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
so the way it plays the machines do
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
better financially I anticipate both
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
individuals to play more as well as more
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
people to come play because right now
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's a large number of people
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
traveling to Boston and Springfield and
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
plan Ridge and migan sun and Foxwoods um
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
because the product in New Hampshire is
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
not the same as the product there I
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate more of them to come up here
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
and I would expect particularly in the
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
southern rooms Nash
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
Salem you know all on the southern
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
border they place there not by accident
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
that 2/3 to three quarters will be Mass
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
residents I'm sorry my so are you still
 
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
are you suggest I'm trying to understand
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
this from like a um a public perspective
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
point of view um it sounds like there's
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
a difference between historic horse
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
racing and slot machines um there are
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
people who are supportive of one but
 
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
when you bring up that they're slot
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
machines then all of a sudden there's a
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
group of people who dig in their heels
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
and say we did not approve that um I'm
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
sure remember with Kino communities had
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
the option to accept Kino into their
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
Community or not I don't think they had
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
the option with the historic horse
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
racing and I'm not sure um where this
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
would end up with and I'm still
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
surprised that we're discussing it
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
instead of ways and
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
means y
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that I I answer that
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
question yeah yeah
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
sorry okay all right no it's Sly I'm you
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
know we're subject I'm a subject man
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
expert on gaming and so I can submit to
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
you as terms of the math behind it and
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
if you want but in terms of policy
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
decisions regarding who gets to approve
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
yeah ha yeah so let's talk about the
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
math um I should disclose that I'm a
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
lawyer by trade and so math is always
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
something I have to do on a calculator
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's not my most comfortable subject in
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
life but um you know if I'm looking at
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
um the projected
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue um I'm trying to find where my
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
little page is um yeah yeah so 120
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
million by the end
 
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
of right by the end of 27
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
and6 is that right am I reading wrong oh
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
no sorry 58.5 million at the end of 27
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
um for revenues on
 
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
video VTS
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
um so if you do the math that's about is
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
that right if there's
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
58.5% Revenue coming to the state at the
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
end of 27 wouldn't that mean like a
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
total revenue of more like
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
400 yeah it's more than that okay so if
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
you I don't want to know what number
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
numbers you have in front of your
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
representative so I AP oliz I'm talking
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
off of my memory I'm just looking at the
 
00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:32.670 align:start position:0%
off of my memory I'm just looking at the
unrestricted

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.309 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
revenues

00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay if I may that that number is half
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
because you're looking at either general
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
fund or okay or education trust it's
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
really 117 million is the governor's
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
estimate in FAL 27 okay so yeah so 127
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
if you do the breakdown it'd be more
 
00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:51.589 align:start position:0%
if you do the breakdown it'd be more
like

00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
over4 400 million toal it's more than in
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
terms of the overall so like the gross
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
before you do the distribution to the
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
ETF so if I could sort of roll it up a
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
second so there's what's called handle
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
which is activity and then there's gross
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
revenue which is money that's left in
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
the tail at the end of the day and then
 
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
there's what our share is which is a
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of that uh and so we did our
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue Investments based off of what
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
the machine revenue is in similar
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the same growth pattern
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
given the same Marketplace and so
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
essentially um
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
our revenue estimat is based off of
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
$300 a day what is known as win per unit
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
per day right what's left in the machine
 
00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
I think it was approximately 4,400
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
machines being up and running by FY 27
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
for 365 days and so if you do that math
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
it should yield you somewhere
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
around 270 million I
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
think I'm like I said you know I'm a
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer too by training so I leave the
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
math to my col colleague here but um 300
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
unit per day is a pretty standard like
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
Boston right now is over $400 per unit
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
Per Day Rhode Island is a 293 per win
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
per unit per day Maine which has nobody
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
living near it is around $250 win per
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
unit per day so $300 we assumed was
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
actually a pretty legitimate number and
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
so that's what it's based on it's the
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
increased product sorry I'm just
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
thinking ahead if you divide that total
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue by 1.4 million people in our
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
state that means like everybody gambles
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
more than $200 a year
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
right uh no so as I said before um if
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
you drive into any of the parking lots
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
of our so as I believe the best kind of
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
money is out estate money and so most of
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
the facilities are on the border
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
intentionally like there's one in North
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
Conway On the Border one in Keane On the
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
Border one in Lebon On the Border Salem
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
On the Border two on nro On the Border
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
like Portsmith On the Border like the
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
idea being is they are so I did this
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
math when I there was a casino Bill if
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
you put a pinhole in plast out I choose
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
plast out randomly nothing just plast
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
out and you create an hour driving
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
distance which is the standard by which
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
casino driving is measured on the south
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
half of that circle is 1.5 1.6 million
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
people on the north of half of that is
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
500,000 people and so the vast majority
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
of play will drive to New Hampshire
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
is my is is my estimates geography
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't care about I mean I'm sorry
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
retail Behavior doesn't care about
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
geography it's the same logic with
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
liquor if you believed with liquor sold
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
we'd all be drunks constantly and so the
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
majority of liquor sales come from
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
another state um so the same logic
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
applies sure and I think Mr chair if you
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
just indulge me I think um what we're
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
discussing right now is a pretty big
 
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
cultural shift of the way people in our
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
region will game so um it sounds like
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
more people from not New Hampshire are
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
going to be here engaging in this new
 
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
activity so um I just if if we're really
 
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.790 align:start position:0%
activity so um I just if if we're really
not

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
anticipating um New Hampshire
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
citizens participating in this um new
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
activity as much as out of Staters then
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
I think again this is really something
 
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means should be discussing
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like a pretty big
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
cultural societal shift that um we're
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're entertaining right now know this
 
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.270 align:start position:0%
we're entertaining right now know this
hypothetical

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:32.839 align:start position:0%
so representative D thank you for
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
answering all these questions of course
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
you do you see a big shift in Revenue
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
income coming in in the summertime when
 
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
all of the tourists are here andan can
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
you see a pattern that happens of people
 
00:44:47.069 --> 00:44:47.079 align:start position:0%
waving into New Hampshire all this money
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
coming and then the wave going back out
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you it do it
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
does it's an excellent question and um
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
when we had sports betting and mass
 
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.990 align:start position:0%
when we had sports betting and mass
didn't

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
it was massive Portsmith liquor store
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
and the Nashville liquor store were the
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
two biggest hot spots for sports betting
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
probably North
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
America you would literally they would
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
drive there grab a b a couple of bottles
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
and bet while they were in Nashua
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
because they were in New Hampshire you
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
could bet an that New Hampshire uh we
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
don't have that anymore we sell very
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
very similar products to all of our
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
neighbors and so we don't have the
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
massive shifts you will get an uptick in
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
certain regions like the Lakes region
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
does uptick in the summer uh but not
 
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:36.910 align:start position:0%
does uptick in the summer uh but not
globally

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide pH just one more question Mr
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
chair I'm wondering if the assumption is
 
00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
that currently the folks who hold these
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
charitable horse um historical horse R
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
Racing permits are they all are you
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
assuming that they will all adjust to
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
the new
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
VT machines or because my understanding
 
00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
is that um um the investment in those
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
new machines was fairly recently so um
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
are are they all willing to just make
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
the jump to the to the new activity or
 
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
is is that not your assumption so it is
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
my assumption and it was based off a
 
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with virtually every single
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
one of them and the time period as I
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
asked all of them what the time period
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
would be to switch um the investment
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
while significant is not lost most of
 
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
the machines can be
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
converted uh and it's a it's a small
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's a not a small charge because I'm
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
not paying it uh it's $3 to $4,000 per
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
machine to convert uh and
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
so the Zeal in which they've asked me
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.109 --> 00:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
adopt so I'd like to sort of understand
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
what's going on here in terms of the the
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
way this comes to pass because I'm not
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
very familiar with the whole thing did
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
you did
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
the can the Lottery Commission just
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
decide to add new like this the VT thing
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
or can you just sort of explain that
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
part of Works certainly um even if we
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
could I we wouldn't uh we want to make
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
sure uh like for example there was an
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
opinion from the AG's office that we
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
didn't need legislative approval to pass
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
Kino we still waited for you folks to
 
00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:11.559 align:start position:0%
file a bill and pass it and have the
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
governor sign it only because I don't
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
want to step out in front of the state
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of gaming practice and gaming
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
policy so it would have to come from you
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
folks to say well HHR is a very
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
different product than the LTS and it
 
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:29.559 align:start position:0%
would require a legislative change in
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
order to make that happen that's my
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
short answer so I remember all the H
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
over over the horse Ring Thing and and
 
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
voting on that have we voted on this on
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
the V we have not no so it exists in
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
three forms Mr chairman uh there's a
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
house bill there's a Senate bill and
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
then it's contained within HB one and
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
two of the governor's budget so it is
 
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
and two okay so it's literally three
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
places um and I don't know what which
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
version oh I don't know where that bill
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
is but so it's an hb2 as well as the
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
other places that's how the governor
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
covered her Bas correct yeah so there's
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
literally it's all three places at once
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
and they're all different versions of
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
the same what was the house bill number
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
do you know I it's House Bill
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
728 thank yeah and we did go over this
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
if you remember a couple days ago when
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
we went through the trailer bill it is
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
in it is in here than you and just to
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
revisit the process so house Ways and
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
Means will take up House Bill 728 they
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
haven't had a public hearing yet and
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
they'll have a um report filed on that
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
bill and that will align still with your
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
timeline of the budget so this committee
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
could wait for the house policy to be
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
set on VTS uh and then you could
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
override anything in House Bill too with
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
what the house passes if you so chose or
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
you could let it be its own stand
 
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
Standalone pieace of legislation and
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
historical practice like we had
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier this week is policy
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
related items in House Bill 2 house
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
finance has parse those out to the
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
policy committees for review so this
 
00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:57.079 align:start position:0%
would should should be a house a Ways
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
and Means task to come up with a
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
decision on this not necessarily this
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
committee what we would want to consider
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
is if the house position is to authorize
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
maybe check back with Lottery to see
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
would they need any changes to their
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
operating budget to align with the
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.549 --> 00:49:21.559 align:start position:0%
program repr
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
papich thank you just to follow up on
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
what Mr landrian just said I just want
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
to check that as of now based on what's
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
in hb2 everything is consistent we are
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
just worried about potentially the house
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
amending or doing something to the
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
legislation that's not current but we
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
are up to date right now in terms of the
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
revenue projections versus the legal
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
language in hb2 HB 728 correct the only
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
thing we're not up to date on I think
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
our positions that would be added to it
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
if this was authorized and I believe it
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
was in our fiscal note
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
for uh it was the Senate version we put
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
FAL note but other than that yes if it's
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
in a fiscal note it's there I mean we'll
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
worry about it if the bill passes and so
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah it's well down the road of
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Kelly All We thanks
 
00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:19.799 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm kind of naive about this
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
but how much of this is internet is my
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
assumption was that sports betting was
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
internet um is
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
ey lottery so um thank you for the
 
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
question um and I wish you were better
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
I'm clear not you're not one of our
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
customers clearly uh I'm so I'm so bad
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
that after the Big Jack jackpot it's the
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
day after that I say oh so really our
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
internet Revenue comes from two main
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
sources um about 85% of the activity for
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
sports betting is done mobile
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
internet about 85% 15% is done retail so
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
our Sports books our physical Sports
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
books there's four of them that 15%
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
happens there um and then I Lottery is
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
100% through the internet and that
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
includes a number of things like you
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
could buy a Powerball ticket through the
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
internet you could buy a Mega Millions
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
ticket through the internet uh you know
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
bad snowstorm that obviously spikes
 
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
because folks can play but they don't
 
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
have to leave their house uh and you can
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
buy scratch tickets that are interactive
 
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
on their phone as well so that I Lottery
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
um net win is essentially that's all ey
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
that that's right that's right so as a
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
followup how do you U monitor what is
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
out of state and sales and what is in
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
state sales both of the platforms have
 
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
robust products on them um that's
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
governed by a company called geoc comply
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
which geofences the
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
state um border and so if you are on or
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
near the border uh the wager is blocked
 
00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh the algorithm is so sophisticated if
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
you're on 89 driving West and you were
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
going to cross the Connecticut River
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
before you finish your wager The Wager
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
will time out it will know you're going
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
so many miles per hour The Wager is
 
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to take so many seconds and the
 
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
wager will time out so and it the entire
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
universe tested this those that are
 
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to us doing this and they found
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
no holes in our
 
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
system repr papovich just to add a
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
little bit to it as somebody who may
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
have had a draft King's account
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
it's quite annoying because sometimes I
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
swear to God I am inside the Border but
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
the damn phone doesn't trust me it's
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
very Twitchy near the border it is very
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
hard you know the Geo fencing is very
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
strict I don't think we'll have
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
compliance because again you guys have
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulators you have all the kind
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
of regulators breathing down your necks
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
if you dare plus Massachusetts would
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
throw a Feit if you try to sell you know
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
to allow beds to be placed while
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's got forb in Massachusetts so
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
yeah I could the the biggest problem we
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
had was when we launched sports betting
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
there are two sports bars in Portsmith
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
one that's well Inland and then one
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's on the border of the pascatore
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
river and 350 ft was the distance that
 
00:53:11.309 --> 00:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
was safe for us to say if you're within
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
350 ft and that sports bar couldn't take
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
Sports Wagers and the entire patrons
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
went up and left and went to the sports
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
bar and the owner of that sports bar
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
called and was Furious we had to carve
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
out this one spot on the map for the
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
sports bar that now okay they're they're
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
clearly in Portsmith but they're too
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
close to P Paso River to uh so it's a
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
very robust product that maintains our
 
00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:40.190 align:start position:0%
very robust product that maintains our
um

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
geofence of course silly but with all
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
the sports betting that goes on you have
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
it I don't bet so I'm not familiar with
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
all this stuff but I know all of my
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
family is doing Bing online with their
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
Sports and what have you do we get any
 
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
of that Revenue if people are betting
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
here here in New Hampshire on say Kansas
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
or we get a portion of that so yes um we
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
get the a very large portion of it um by
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
the way you asked me for free tickets
 
00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
nobody plays in here
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
just that's
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
not um so um sports betting we are
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
actually the number two state in the
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
country per capita for sports betting
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
revenue for the State uh behind New York
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
only um every bet placed in every bet
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
placed in New Hampshire we get a
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
percentage of that Revenue we split it
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
with DraftKings but it's around 43% of
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
the profit uh we
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
get so we have we have what most
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
characterizes as an exceptionally
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
enviable deal um and moreover DraftKings
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
is as our vendor partner moved one of
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
their offices to nsha and hired uh 20
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
software developers who work out of an
 
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
office in nashille and as n Corporation
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
so not only do they are vendor part
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
they've actually become a business in
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
fans papovich well it's kind of nice not
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
to have an income tax and sales taxes
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
and all that but um the other point to
 
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
be made is that people will gamble
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
anyway it's better that they do it in a
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
properly regulated manner above board
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
where they have legal recourse cuz God
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
knows if my uh friendly bookie who I
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
called on Friday night doesn't quite
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
remember remember the conversation the
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
same way I do I cannot exactly go to the
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
judge while with you know all this it's
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
so heavily regulated it's safe it gives
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
people a lot of confidence and we do
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of money to put it into
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
resources to help people who may have an
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
addiction issue and what not if I recall
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
if you have any details on that yeah I
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
mean certainly we technology is the easy
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
part because we can set limits um on how
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
much you can deposit you yourself can
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
set limits which I find to be more
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
effective if you yourself have a have
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know you have an issue you can set
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
limits or you can self-exclude we have a
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
very large not very large I think it's a
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
couple thousand people now that are on
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
exclusion list that say close my account
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
don't take money from me also the call
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
centers are trained to look for certain
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
words so for example on a Monday if
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
somebody says oh I need to win tonight
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
in order to pay my bills there can't
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
their account is disabled uh because we
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
don't we try and protect folks from
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
themselves to the extent you can um and
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
give them the rules to make it happen um
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
so the short answer is yes and as a
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
former organized crime prosecutor I can
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
tell you with a certainty approaching
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
death and taxes that sports betting went
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.319 --> 00:56:42.109 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
so any other
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
questions everybody good and you didn't
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
both thank you for your
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
patience learned a lot and I really
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate it Mr chair Mr chair there is
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
a section in the trailer bill it's that
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
boiler play language it's in the back of
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
house Bill W about the so that went from
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
6 million to 15 million there's an
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
increase to that certainly I apologize I
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
should have spoken to that um there's
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
specific language that authoriz us to
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
buy scratch tickets it's been there
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
since the 70s uh and the amount hasn't
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
changed in well since I've been here at
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
six million a year we've exceeded that
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
annually and LBA audit team has pointed
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
that out and so we were looking to
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
increase the amount it doesn't change
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
anything in the budget it's just an
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
ability to increase what we buy from
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets during the bayum and so
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
that's the language it literally just
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
changes 6 million to 15 million it
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anything
 
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
else and that's in increasing the number
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
the amount of scratch tickets you can
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
purchase no it's actually just
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount we're allowed to
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
do even though and I hate to say this
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
we've we spent more than that annually
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh because we've increased scratch
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
ticket sales from almost doubled it the
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
last 10 years and so we're buying more
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets and we're more
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
profitable at them so the cost has gone
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
up and so so does the increase in the
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
number scat ticket you buy exactly yeah
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
exactly and it's not a it's not an
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
expense of the the budget like it's not
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
a yeah no I understand yeah yeah it's
 
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
just literally just a we have because
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're buying way more we have to
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
increase the number the authorization
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
got it correct yeah it's more yeah so
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
that's hb1 and then hb2 has a language
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
authorizing the video the video gaming
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
it does yes to begin with okay and um
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
there's something else about that that
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
language the video gaming oh represent
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
Murray raised the question
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
about the town cities whatever having um
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
any ability to to regulate it so the
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
with the which one was it that they
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
could it was could Kino so Kino that was
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
part of the law that said they could
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
well it's actually to that point uh it's
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
more than just Kino it's Kino and sports
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
betting and when the lottery was
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
originally founded in 1963 towns and
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
cities were allowed to say no to selling
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
lottery tickets um about I think
 
00:59:15.789 --> 00:59:15.799 align:start position:0%
10ed um but yes so that's those
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
Provisions exist in those three areas
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
but not in the VT Bill uh I know there's
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
a I think there's a bill filed to have
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
the towns have an option going forward
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember the number but it's
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay but not an hp2 in any H2 no no
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
so it it mirrors what's going on with
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
the horse correct fting approach does it
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
mirrors what horse racing horse racing
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
allowed yeah thank you so I guess maybe
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
we're really done now are you fine set
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much both of you
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
