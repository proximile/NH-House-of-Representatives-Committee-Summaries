00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay we have a busy morning
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
let's start off with the lottery
 
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.550 align:start position:0%
let's start off with the lottery
commissioner

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
commission which is charlie mcintyre
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
the executive director uh discussing the
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
sports betting
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
is mr mcintyre here
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
he is rep seven major along with a mr
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
maloney so they're both available to
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
speak to you
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
also i sent to the committee this
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
morning um a powerpoint
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
it's actually a pdf file that i
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
converted but it's uh charlie's gonna
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
put it up on the screen i think but i
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
and it's just related to sports betting
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
a a document if they would
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you see the front of
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
this it's all yellow
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
and when you're printing from home that
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
we uses up an
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
awful lot of yellow right
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
so if there was the same color
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
for charts fine but when they take the
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
whole background
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
we'll try to encourage that going
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
forward represent major
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
so charlie if you want to share your
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
okay great good morning everyone this is
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
charlie mcintyre
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
um executive director of new hampshire
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
lottery and with me um
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
today is our director of sports betting
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
danny maloney
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
um and i think you folks have questions
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
related to revenues related to sports
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
betting particularly as relates to
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
the super bowl of a couple of weeks ago
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
or a week and a half ago so
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go through only a few
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
slides there's only a handful
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
i apologize for the yellow ink i won't
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
do that again certainly not when i'm not
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
handing them out to you
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
and so mr chairman i'll go through the
 
00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:43.829 align:start position:0%
and so mr chairman i'll go through the
slides

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
slides
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
and then if you have questions if you
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
can save them to the end because some of
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
the slides might answer the questions
 
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
this is a chart of the revenues
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
related to new hampshire lottery sports
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
betting by month
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
for calendar year 2020. we launched
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
december 30th
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
of 2019 so obviously december of 19 with
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
not have meaningful revenues because it
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
was basically a day and a half
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
so this is our first year of revenue and
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'll go through the definitions
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
left to right obviously month means the
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
calendar month
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
handle means the amount of wagering the
 
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
handle means the amount of wagering the
lottery

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
took in during that month so if
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative major about 50
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
on the patriots and i bet fifty dollars
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the chiefs
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
that would be a hundred dollars ggr
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
stands for gross gaming revenue which is
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
the amount left over
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
after all of the wagers have been paid
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
off that won
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
so this in large terms is the gross
 
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.030 align:start position:0%
so this in large terms is the gross
profit

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
the lottery and the draftkings
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
realize hold
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
is a function of the percentage
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
of revenue that the lottery and
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
draftkings keep
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of the wagered amount
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so what that means is
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
if we paid out ninety dollars out of a
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars bet
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
the hold would be ten percent if that
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
makes sense to everyone
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then the final column is the state
 
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.829 align:start position:0%
and then the final column is the state
revenue

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
as you can see the hold which is the
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
amount we keep as profit
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
varies dramatically month by month
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
and so for example in some months we
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
were below five percent
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
and in some months we're above 10 and
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
that's a factor and that's a function of
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
all of the various events that happened
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
in a given month
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
and whether the folks who want them who
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
bet on them won or lost
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
um we would expect the hold over the
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
course of a year to be somewhere between
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
six and eight percent
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
seven percent being the middle obviously
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
we would submit that
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
in you know this past year was not a
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
normal year by any stretch and still
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
quite literally isn't so our revenues in
 
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:10.790 align:start position:0%
quite literally isn't so our revenues in
march

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
through july were significantly lower
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
than we would anticipate
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
for sports betting so look at the handle
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
three million dollars is a very low
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
number for a month because
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the month of april there wasn't much
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
sports to bet on
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
you know all of the leagues cancelled
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
their events college
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
cancelled their events um there are a
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
number of events that are large in the
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
calendar for example like the
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
ncaa basketball tournament would have
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
been during that april the final games
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
would have been very large
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
didn't exist so in this year
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
2020 calendar year the state profited 11
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
and our original revenue estimates were
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
in a full calendar year all events and
 
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.629 align:start position:0%
in a full calendar year all events and
so

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
going forward we would anticipate uh to
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
exceed that figure the original 10
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars we had estimated when
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
sports betting was launched
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
and if we go to the next slide
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
so this for example is a the top five
 
00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:09.110 align:start position:0%
so this for example is a the top five
events

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
events
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
in the month of january by how much the
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
state profited
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
meaning folks bet on an event
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
and because they bet on the side that
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
lost to a large extent
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
the state profited so the same terms
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
apply handle gross gaming revenue and
 
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.269 align:start position:0%
apply handle gross gaming revenue and
hold

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
hold
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
and as you can see lots of folks bet on
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
the seahawks
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
i think it was the cx to beat the rams
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh danny is that right
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh yes yeah and so the state profited a
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
great deal and so
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
these are our five largest events by the
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
mount the state profited
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
obviously the college football clemson
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
lost to ohio state
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
that was quite good for the state and on
 
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.069 align:start position:0%
that was quite good for the state and on
down

00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
and every month these events vary by
 
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.190 align:start position:0%
and every month these events vary by
type

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
type
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
in some months they'll be college
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
basketball and
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
obviously during football season
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
football tends to be larger
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
and so those are the five events for
 
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.710 align:start position:0%
and so those are the five events for
example

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
in january by state win and then these
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
are the five
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
by state laws and so as you can see
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
you have very large events and this one
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
for example mr brady
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
q keeps winning um and a lot of folks
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
here obviously have
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
fondness for mr brady mr gronkowski a
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
lot of folks
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh wagered on the timothy buccaneers in
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
january and
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
were rewarded by significant winnings
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
um and so that led up to obviously uh
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
the super bowl
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
in in february 7th um
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
and one of the things about the
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
buccaneers winning was
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
they weren't supposed to win in fact
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
they weren't supposed to get out of the
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
first round of the playoffs but
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
because they were not favored the odds
 
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.470 align:start position:0%
because they were not favored the odds
were

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
significantly greater than they would
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
have been had they been a favorite team
 
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.150 align:start position:0%
have been had they been a favorite team
so

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
for example you see the bottom of the
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
screen there it says future
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
buccaneers to win the nfc championships
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
the amount wagered was only 41 000
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
but we paid off at 130 000 because the
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
odds were so
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
against them they weren't supposed to
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
win uh their packages were favored by a
 
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
but this is the good news
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
so this is sports betting by state
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2020
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
in our first year of operations when you
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
run across the same terms
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
handle gross gaming revenue hold and
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
state revenue
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're third per capita in the country in
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
our first year of operations
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
um and the other states are fall off
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
the super bowl um while our liability at
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
one point prior to
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
the game was three million dollars
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
because there was a significant
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
amount of wagered activity um wagering
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
on the kansas city chiefs the total loss
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
for the game
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
ended up as 1.7 million and it is likely
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
we will actually break even or
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
have a little profit for february going
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
forward based on
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
the month and so singular events can
 
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:11.990 align:start position:0%
the month and so singular events can
skew

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
skew
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
it briefly but over the course of a year
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
it's exceedingly profitable for the
 
00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:17.030 align:start position:0%
it's exceedingly profitable for the
state

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i think we have done better than
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
expected well
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think we did we did better than
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
expected um
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
and amongst our comparators even though
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
we're brand new at this
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
we're number three in the country per
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
i guess mr chairman that was my brief um
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
slideshow and i guess any questions once
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
again more colored ink i'm sorry
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
but um i'll leave whichever slide up you
 
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.710 align:start position:0%
but um i'll leave whichever slide up you
want

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll happily answer questions as
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the committee it was
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
a great presentation
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh questions from members
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative jamal can you
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
thank you can you describe uh explain
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
the hold again for me please certainly
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's a percentage of
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
our profit which is gross gaming revenue
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
as against the handle which is the
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
amount wagered
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
so really in business terms it would be
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
our gross profit
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
and we split that 50 50 with draftkings
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
without offset for promotions but it's
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
hi hi charlie thank you um
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
so we know a lot of the betting is is
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
from massachusetts
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if you have the exact
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
split of how much is from mass but
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
are you sensing anything in the in the
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
massachusetts legislature
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
that may make sports betting legal there
 
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the near future
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
yes certainly as we do our revenue
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
estimates here certainly to your
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
question the answer is yes
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of our betting
 
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.189 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of our betting
activity

00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
is on mobile and that's 90 percent from
 
00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:08.710 align:start position:0%
is on mobile and that's 90 percent from
in-state

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
in-state
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
88 from mid-state the majority of our
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
physical locations are from out-of-state
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
for massachusetts specifically
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh and that's at the brook in seabrook
 
00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:20.150 align:start position:0%
uh and that's at the brook in seabrook
um

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
i do know that there is a there is
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
activity in the state house of boston
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
for sports better one of the
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
difficulties there is there are so many
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that are fighting each
 
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.750 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that are fighting each
other

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
i would imagine it'll be difficult for a
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill to come out i would expect one to
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
come out
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things there that i don't
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
worry about so much
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
is their physical locations are likely
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
to be in everett
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
and springfield and plainville nowhere
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
near our border
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
so there's that secondarily i would
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
imagine i don't i haven't seen the law
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
yet i would imagine that their
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
wagering activity would be subject to
 
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.150 align:start position:0%
wagering activity would be subject to
taxation

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
and we would have an immediate six
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
percent advantage because we don't take
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
state income taxes and mass does
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
and so the wager in mass would be
 
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:08.950 align:start position:0%
and so the wager in mass would be
benefited

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
benefited
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
six percent by driving to new hampshire
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
so certainly as relates to our revenue
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
estimates we don't
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
we don't make a change based off of it i
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
don't expect it to be certainly the next
 
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.590 align:start position:0%
don't expect it to be certainly the next
year

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh the following year possibly but um
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
i don't i wouldn't lower it but
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
certainly representative brahmy
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's a quick follow-up how about any
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
rumblings in maine
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh there are rumblings in maine yes but
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
nothing substantive and the governor
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
seems opposed to it so and she vetoed a
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill last time
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you would you send us an
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
email relative to the data you just gave
 
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.830 align:start position:0%
email relative to the data you just gave
us

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
relative to mobile versus fixed
 
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.510 align:start position:0%
relative to mobile versus fixed
locations

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
those are interesting percentages
 
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.110 align:start position:0%
those are interesting percentages
certainly

00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
can you give us a description or send us
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
a description of how you find
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
the people who have been betting on
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
um in very large amounts the ones that
 
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.230 align:start position:0%
um in very large amounts the ones that
you

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
decided to define as problem problem
 
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.909 align:start position:0%
decided to define as problem problem
gamblers

00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
gamblers
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
and what what you do once you've
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
identified them
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
um i can't danny
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
right so we're what we're looking at in
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
problem gaming activity it's not
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily the amounts um because
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
obviously there are people of
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
of high means that can bet you know very
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
very high amounts in a game
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
without a problem uh the way that the
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
problem gaming
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh works on draftkings system is they
 
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.190 align:start position:0%
uh works on draftkings system is they
have

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh user controls where a user can kind
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
of set limits
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
for either day month week however they
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
want to kind of limit their play
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
and they also have the ability through
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
algorithms where if a person is betting
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
um i guess the term be like chasing
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
losses if a person is
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
escalating they keep betting higher and
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
higher um
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
it kind of sets off a flag uh for
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
for the for the system in the system
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
that when they call in
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
draftkings can kind of give them
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
information like here's the national
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
council from problem gaming
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
i hear these new these tools you have if
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
you want to limit your play
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of it's you can't really do
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
it on an amount it's it's hard to do
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's kind of because it's all relative
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
to the person
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
but there are tools within the system
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
that a person can preemptively prevent
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
themselves from having a problem
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
and there are algorithms that run that
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
look for certain activity that a player
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
is doing
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
that would make draftkings need to reach
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
could i follow all right sure
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so this this is
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
dependent on draftkings
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
on doing things and there are
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
algorithms such as the one about betting
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
more and more and more uh increasingly
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
and and you send them to regular
 
00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:15.990 align:start position:0%
and and you send them to regular
national

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
national
 
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.029 align:start position:0%
national
helplines

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
correct uh draftkings and i'm sorry
 
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.230 align:start position:0%
correct uh draftkings and i'm sorry
sorry

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i was um told before that
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
on mr mcintyre would be
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to to his friend in massachusetts
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
to ask if they
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
studied how useful this was
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
i i did representative elmi um
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
i actually emailed the exchange with
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
marlene warner who is the head of mass
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
council on problem gambling
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
i had forwarded previously um the
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
resources she had
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
directed me towards um to one i think a
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee staff member but i can forward
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
it along to you directly if you want
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
i said that email probably 10 days ago
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't think i just i didn't
 
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
see that email
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
okay today directly then if that's okay
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chairman if i could introduce
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
danny uh if you give us background for
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
10 seconds
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes oh hello uh so i am i'm
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
an attorney uh is in my uh past life
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh i'm now uh i just received an llm
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
from unlv
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
in gaming law and regulation i started
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
with the lottery in august
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
extremely excited to be here so i've
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
been really studying
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh different types of uh casino gaming
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
sports betting obviously was the big
 
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:36.950 align:start position:0%
sports betting obviously was the big
focus

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
focus
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
because of the the repeal that happened
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago by the supreme
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
court uh so i kind of came out of the
 
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
court uh so i kind of came out of the
program

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
and got right to the lottery and and
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's been uh been a pretty smooth
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
transition since
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
you know we really hit the ground
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
running in new hampshire
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.789 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
bernstein

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
bernstein
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair hey all things
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
considered charlie and danny
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
you guys had a fantastic year uh so
 
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
congratulations on that
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with the imbalance
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
when uh
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
too many bets are placed on team a
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
instead of team b
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
and exposing the state to some liability
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't you go out of state and place a
 
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
couldn't you go out of state and place a
bet

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
bet
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
to even it out so it's 50 50. is that
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
two in your arsenal
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
and if it is let me hear you thinking
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
about why or why you wouldn't
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
do such a thing um i i don't think it is
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
it would require me
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
taking money from the state treasury and
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
betting in another state
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
um which i think would be an issue um
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
um honestly
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's two ways to do this there's
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
actually changing the odds the problem
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
with changing the odds is you're going
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
folks who are experienced bettors what
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
we call sharps
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
who chase lines who actually look for
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
line movement
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
and better accordingly and what that
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
does is it really benefits
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
experienced sharp betters at the expense
 
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:05.909 align:start position:0%
experienced sharp betters at the expense
of

00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
casual players and so what really what
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
you have to do in this regard and have
 
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.190 align:start position:0%
you have to do in this regard and have
to

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
you know you have to set the line
 
00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:14.230 align:start position:0%
you know you have to set the line
correctly

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
and just you know root against the
 
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
and just you know root against the
buccaneers

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
buccaneers
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know that's all there is to it and
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
and hope because that
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you want folks to
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
have the experience was supposed to have
 
00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:25.110 align:start position:0%
have the experience was supposed to have
and

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
we tried to mimic this as against the
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
illegal market
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
so the illegal bookmaker sets odds and
 
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.430 align:start position:0%
so the illegal bookmaker sets odds and
lives

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
and breathes by wins and losses and so
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to have a
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
a market which was overly beneficial to
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
the state because that really
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
is to the detriment of the player base
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm saying
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
like if you look i still like delaware
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
where the hold is 19
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's not a product that's going to be
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
survived it's going to survive long
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
because folks who play are going to know
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
i'm losing 9 of my bet to the state i'd
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
rather go someplace else
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
and so what we want to have is a
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
competitive product in the marketplace
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
yes we danny actually did up a mock
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
diagram of
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
if we took half a million dollars and
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
went to delaware or rhode island
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
um but you know ingest obviously we
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you charlie uh
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
represented murphy thank you i just had
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
a question about the um
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
percent split with the hold is that
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
50 50 across the united states or and
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
how is that number or that split
 
00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:34.230 align:start position:0%
how is that number or that split
negotiated

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
negotiated
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
it fails wildly by state the new
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire way we do things is now called
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire model
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
which is really the state controls the
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
function and profits directly from it
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
whereas a state like nevada which is
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
where danny came from
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
they just regulate it like it's they're
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
selling bagels
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a very very low percentage of
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
state receives like you look at nevada's
 
00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
state receives like you look at nevada's
number

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
that did four billion dollars of waging
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
activity in 2020
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
and they only kept 17 million of it um
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
ours is by contract and so it's a 50 50
 
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.310 align:start position:0%
ours is by contract and so it's a 50 50
split

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
split
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
with a uh allowance for marketing and
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
promotions that we give to draftkings to
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
promote to the player base so it ends up
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
being around
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
45 percent i think
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
yeah this question is about uh sports
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
books here in new hampshire
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
locations and the the question of
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
limiting those locations that came up
 
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.390 align:start position:0%
limiting those locations that came up
around

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
that other bill we were looking at i
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't remember its number
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
and during that discussion i
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
i asked for follow-up information
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
about the specific to the
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh sports books that have been set up
 
00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:57.110 align:start position:0%
uh sports books that have been set up
and

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
i think uh contract information and
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
whatever would help us all
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
better understand what we're talking
 
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.710 align:start position:0%
better understand what we're talking
about

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that was part of the same email
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative ames thank you for the
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
question i'd forward it along
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'll read forward again if that's okay
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it must have missed the vote
 
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.510 align:start position:0%
yeah it must have missed the vote
somewhere

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know like i said because i
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
collected that the contract data the
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
towns that voted for it uh the resources
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
i received from marlene
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
mass council of problem gambling so i'll
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
forward that along again
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes nice presentation thank you for the
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
betting mobile betting that occurs out
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
of state do you
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
so everything in state is placed in
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
state if you were a resident of mass
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
and placed a bet here you're on your own
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
taxes in massachusetts
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh how you file there or what you comply
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
with is up to you we don't
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
obviously withhold on the for other
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
states um
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
but i i like i said you have to be in
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
state to bet
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
and so there's no income tax in the
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
state so we don't um
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you charlie chairman thank you
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%

next we have the department of revenue
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members can you
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
yes we said all right great
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
so we were invited to come on to speak
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
to you concerning some outstanding
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
questions you had
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
um and i'll just tick through the
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions if that works and then we can
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
ask any other additional questions you
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
may have
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
that would be fine okay perfect
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
so the first question that the committee
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
had emailed us was concerning the
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
communication services tax
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
and if there were any further clarifying
 
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.870 align:start position:0%
and if there were any further clarifying
um

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
answers to applying the tax to
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
video conferencing platforms
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to say that we are
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
continuing to reach out
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
this is um a fairly new situation as you
 
00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:52.230 align:start position:0%
this is um a fairly new situation as you
know

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
our audit team is reaching out to look
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
at who is filing and who is not
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
filing and continue to get in get those
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers into compliance
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
we don't have an exact revenue estimate
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
to apply to those taxpayers because we
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
do have to determine who is currently
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
paying and who is not paying
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
um however i think we have a zero
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
percent growth
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
and typically that cst has been a
 
00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:18.549 align:start position:0%
and typically that cst has been a
declining

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
declining
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
loss every month um or every year
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
so we think that keeping it at zero
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
including the voip and then including
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
these taxpayers to get them into
 
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.830 align:start position:0%
these taxpayers to get them into
compliance

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
will equal to a zero percent growth
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions on cst
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
questions on cst
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
representative olney thank you mr
 
00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:44.630 align:start position:0%
representative olney thank you mr
chairman

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
on can you tell us what
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
exactly they're supposed to be paying
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
tax on
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
a zoom-like object entity
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's a little sure it's a little
 
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.990 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's a little sure it's a little
complicated

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
um so i'll try to keep it at a high
 
00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:06.070 align:start position:0%
um so i'll try to keep it at a high
level

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
so it is a two-way communication the
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
video conferencing platform
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
and cst is taxable on that two-way video
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
conferencing platform
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
so whatever you're paying for the zoom
 
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.389 align:start position:0%
so whatever you're paying for the zoom
or

00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
for the teams or forever
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
whichever video conferencing platform
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
you are using that
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
portion there should be a portion
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
taxable to new hampshire
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
um which portion gets a little bit
 
00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:32.149 align:start position:0%
um which portion gets a little bit
complicated

00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to try to to say that
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say the wrong
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
information um our audit team is
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
definitely digging into that and making
 
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.590 align:start position:0%
definitely digging into that and making
sure

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh to find out which portion is taxable
 
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.029 align:start position:0%
uh to find out which portion is taxable
but

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
because it is a two-way communication it
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
is classified as taxable for cst
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
melissa i as a customer
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
pay 15 dollars a month for the zoom
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
now that's a month it's not a function
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
of how long i use it
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
about a month so do i have to pay a tax
 
00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
about a month so do i have to pay a tax
or

00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
zoom have to pay a tax so typically cst
 
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:12.789 align:start position:0%
zoom have to pay a tax so typically cst
is

00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
a consumer-based tax so the consumer is
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
paying it
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of people will see that on their
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
phone bill if they currently have a
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
phone bill
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
they'll see it at the bottom so
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
typically the taxpayer does pay it
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
however different platforms could tax it
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
differently meaning they could roll it
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
into the price so
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
what we don't know is that 15 that
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
if if that is inclusive of their tax or
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
exclusive of the tax of the tax
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
because i don't get it from through my
 
00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.669 align:start position:0%
because i don't get it from through my
phone

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
i get it through zoom itself okay
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
right so that's the part that um our
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
audit team is looking into it
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
all right the next one there were two of
 
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.269 align:start position:0%
all right the next one there were two of
us

00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
where's the brownie reps of all me have
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
their hands up or up some major
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
oh okay i didn't see that representative
 
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.310 align:start position:0%
oh okay i didn't see that representative
abrandi

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
abrandi
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
oh thank you uh do you know if uh
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
we've captured some of the big boys like
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
zoom at this point
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
i know you can't talk about individual
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
companies but have we captured some of
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
the big boys or the
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
the ones who seem to have captured the
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
market the best in this
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
environment sure thank you for your
 
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.230 align:start position:0%
environment sure thank you for your
question

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
um we're still looking into that because
 
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.509 align:start position:0%
um we're still looking into that because
some

00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
of the larger taxpayers do currently pay
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
however what they're paying on i think
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
is what we're looking into to make sure
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
video conferencing platform is included
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
so you could have one taxpayer who
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
offers multiple cst services that are
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
taxable but we want to make sure that
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
the video
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
online conferencing platforms are
 
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.029 align:start position:0%
online conferencing platforms are
taxable

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit tricky to answer
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
okay you're working out then okay thank
 
00:33:58.559 --> 00:33:59.909 align:start position:0%
okay you're working out then okay thank
you

00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
on i paid for a year's license up front
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
rather than the 15 a month so on
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
i guess i got a one bill i don't
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
remember a bill
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
at all and um
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
so that's a different version of of how
 
00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:23.510 align:start position:0%
so that's a different version of of how
they

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
allow this assume itself how they allow
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
you to
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
to pay for it um and i imagine
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
that that our cities and towns are or
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
we probably don't tax them or paid uh
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
are paying for
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
teams on a year at a time
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
they may not be but
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
on that just when you're trying to
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
figure out what's going on there are
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll be happy to share that with
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
i do not see any other raised hands
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the communication tax so
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh melissa utility property tax
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
sure so hopefully um you guys received
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax you
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
had requested a list of utilities that
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
paid this tax and that is available on
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
our website
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
so i i had forwarded along a link
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
to crochet for the most recent utility
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
property tax valuations and taxpayers
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
but if you go to our website we also
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
have historical views so i think that
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
answers question
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
two as for question three
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
for the utility property tax was our
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
dams included in this tax and if so are
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
the dams on the connecticut river are
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
portioned between new hampshire and
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
vermont when applying the tax
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
so we did a little research um dams are
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
taxed as utility property tax if they
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
are used for hydroelectric power
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and then for who pays the tax
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's actually based on what the um dam
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
reports so i'm just gonna i'm gonna
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
read the answer on this one if the case
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
if the case on dams on connecticut river
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
are utilized for hydro prop or hydro
 
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.510 align:start position:0%
are utilized for hydro prop or hydro
power

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
the appraised value is allocated between
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
the two states the taxpayer reports the
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
cost of basis on their assets in both
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
states and we allocate final appraisal
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
value based on the cost
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
basis so it comes from um
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
it comes from the the utility the dam
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
actually says
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
how much of the appraised value is in
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and how much is in vermont
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
and then they pay that portion um
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
whichever is allocated to new hampshire
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
when i looked at the who pays that
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
utility property tax
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
the document you sent sentence about 35
 
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.510 align:start position:0%
the document you sent sentence about 35
pages

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
pages
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
of people who pay that's tremendous but
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
just about every
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
community pays as well as dams and the
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on i don't think
 
00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:15.589 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on i don't think
it's

00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
at those utility pay payments i was
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the lebanon ones
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
and on there are companies that
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
have a piece of their their operation
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
inside lebanon
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
and it's based on how much property is
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
inside lebanon but
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's not lebanon that's paying it at
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
least not directly
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
and i looked at all the ones up and down
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
the connecticut river
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
and it looked like vermont was
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
paying more of it than i had expected
 
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.390 align:start position:0%
paying more of it than i had expected
but

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
since the dam itself and
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
whatever is on our side is is uh
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
paid um is
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire but on
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
i guess the the one in
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
in lebanon and windsor i think it is
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
are is has got
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
part of its generation on the vermont
 
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.270 align:start position:0%
part of its generation on the vermont
side

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
but i remember visiting the new
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire side of it and
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
there was more there i thought
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and where is this a a town
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's not the town it's the utility
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
building within that town like in my
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
town plaza we don't have any
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
water at all uh and
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
the building that utility owned within
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
our town is the one payment
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions of representative
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
on the utility property
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
yeah as like i mentioned uh last time
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
this is a comment um
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
there is a bill and uh that i'm a
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh the science and tech asked me to join
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
in with them
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh there's some discussion about
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
changing the assessment
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh parameters on this
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh going forward but i don't know where
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
this is going it really is not going to
 
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.030 align:start position:0%
this is going it really is not going to
impact

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
the total uh estimates that we're trying
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh but i'll just mention that there's
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
some uh there's one assessor who's
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
claiming that the town that the the dams
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
aren't giving the proper information and
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
for them to do the proper assessing or
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
so we're we're uh we're looking at that
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
through the spill
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's gonna form a commission to look at
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um yeah this
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear and make sure
 
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:55.610 align:start position:0%
that we're all clear on
 
00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.790 align:start position:0%
that we're all clear on
[Music]

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
the taxation of utility properties
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
by using the utility prop statewide
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
the state's utility property tax and
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
then the statewide
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
education property tax and then the
 
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.349 align:start position:0%
education property tax and then the
local

00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
tax on properties and uh maybe another
 
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.349 align:start position:0%
tax on properties and uh maybe another
say

00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you you've got that one down
 
00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:22.470 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you you've got that one down
and

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
if you could just explain it that would
 
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.230 align:start position:0%
if you could just explain it that would
help

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative ames i'm
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
actually gonna kick this to the
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner utility property
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
is not my strong suit
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
um and i think she could probably better
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
explain it thanks good
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
i represented here let me turn my camera
 
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.510 align:start position:0%
i represented here let me turn my camera
on

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
so you can all see me um carol clear
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the new hampshire
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
department of revenue i think your
 
00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
department of revenue i think your
question

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
was you're looking for an explanation of
 
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.230 align:start position:0%
was you're looking for an explanation of
how

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax relates to
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
the statewide education property tax
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
and the local property tax is that right
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes so for purposes of
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
um state taxation of utilities
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue values
 
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.750 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue values
utilities

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
independently um and issues them
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
an assessment they pay that property tax
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
directly to the department and we
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
deposit that money into the education
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
this is very different from how other
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
properties are
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
taxed um you know residential
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
or other commercial property gets valued
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
right at the municipal level and the
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
department although we oversee that
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
valuation process
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
just sort of accepts that valuation for
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
statewide property tax purposes
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
for utility property tax purposes the
 
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
for utility property tax purposes the
municipalities

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
also value those utilities directly for
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
purposes of
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
assessing the local property tax um
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
and those values can be
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat different
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
you also have a good proportion of
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities that for whatever reason
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
likely due to the cost of hiring a
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
specialty assessor
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
just choose to utilize the department's
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
values for purposes of their local
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
property tax um is that what you were
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
looking for representative ames
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
well i um i think there's one other
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
point and that is that the
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
statewide education property tax
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
which um is uh
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
collected and billed by the localities
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
oh yes sure exactly right so as i said
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax gets collected
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
by the department directly
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
and we deposit right into the education
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
whereas the swept applied
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
to all other properties it's collected
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
by the municipality on behalf of the
 
00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:02.309 align:start position:0%
by the municipality on behalf of the
state

00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
and they retain those dollars locally
 
00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:05.910 align:start position:0%
and they retain those dollars locally
that

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
swept um money never actually comes back
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
to the department for deposit into the
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
aka karen you said it's based upon
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
all other properties it's not based on
 
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:21.310 align:start position:0%
the same property
 
00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.670 align:start position:0%
the same property
[Music]

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
no um it's the same all other properties
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
other than utility properties
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay i think the point is that that may
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
chime in that the
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
the statewide what we call swept
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
to simplify statewide education property
 
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
to simplify statewide education property
tax

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:40.770 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:41.990 align:start position:0%
tax
[Music]

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
does not apply to the utilities
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
right they've been covered by the
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
state's utility property tax and to do
 
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:51.349 align:start position:0%
state's utility property tax and to do
it

00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
and so when the
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
localities send out that bill
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
they will not be sending it to the
 
00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:08.230 align:start position:0%
they will not be sending it to the
utilities

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
and the other thing just to note this is
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
that there are actually two bills
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
one is mine that we'll be hearing
 
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.109 align:start position:0%
one is mine that we'll be hearing
tomorrow

00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
that would change the flow of
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
swept money it would still be built by
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
the municipalities but it would go to
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
into the state education trust fund
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
from the municipalities rather than
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
being kept locally as it is now
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'll watch that i tried doing that about
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
18 years ago
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
okay a brownie you stuff another hand up
 
00:45:02.839 --> 00:45:04.870 align:start position:0%
okay a brownie you stuff another hand up
or

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
i guess not i know i do i do i have my
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
i had to move quick here to get my thumb
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
on the uh commute
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
so as people have been around the
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
members that have been around you know i
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
had the bill on municipal property taxes
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
and uh what municipalities do when if
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
they have a power plant
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
in their jurisdiction like let's call
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
seabrook nuclear power plant
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
those municipalities usually negotiate a
 
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.030 align:start position:0%
those municipalities usually negotiate a
value

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
of taxation with with like i think i
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
think seabrook plays two million dollars
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
but that's a negotiated dollar amount so
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
when we were looking
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
and those things are ferc regulated
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
fairly regulated uh utilities
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
and there's three pieces to utilities
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's the generation
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's the big transmission lines
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
transmission lines that go across the
 
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.230 align:start position:0%
transmission lines that go across the
state

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
they're also fork regulated and then the
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
then there's the distribution which are
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
the smaller lines the ones in front of
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
your house
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
that are more locally regulated so when
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
we did our work we
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't look at generation we didn't
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
at the large-scale transmission lines
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
because they
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
that wasn't broken we really worked on
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
the local transmission
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
to come up with a formula for the
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities to
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
to tax uh come up with a property tax
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
value of those
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
so i guess when we're talking about
 
00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
so i guess when we're talking about
generation

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
generation
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
generation not every town has generation
 
00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.190 align:start position:0%
generation not every town has generation
uh

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
a few of them do of some kind i was i
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
was also very surprised at how many dams
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
we have that uh
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
it was very surprising how many dams we
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
had that generate uh
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
power uh throughout the state um
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
but and then the other variable i'm just
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
thinking of
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
well i don't want to go let me stop
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
there so what i'm getting at there's two
 
00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:57.910 align:start position:0%
there so what i'm getting at there's two
pieces

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
there's municipal taxing and then the
 
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.470 align:start position:0%
there's municipal taxing and then the
state

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
one last thought is that the state does
 
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.910 align:start position:0%
one last thought is that the state does
evaluate

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
all property uh as well as utility
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh property and
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and the uh including the
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
distribution stuff
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
and about 20 of the towns
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
just accept that number they accept
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
whatever the state's number is and don't
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
use their own assessors to do it
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
as well for the local distribution part
 
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.430 align:start position:0%
as well for the local distribution part
so

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
but anyway i think i was i don't know if
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
i clarified anything but
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's not as yes i agree with dick
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
games that
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
represent ames that there are different
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
pieces to this
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
and just a piece of information
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
is that when the towns evaluate
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
utility property that the state doesn't
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
such as polls some towns would
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
say put a value of a hundred dollars on
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
a poll
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
another town would put a value of two
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in that fall
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
and that created quite a controversy
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
in providing and also created some
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
went through that just a few years all
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
right can i interject one other thing
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
just to complicate it
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
there's there's telephone poles and
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's electric poles
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
they're different there there they're
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
assessed differently telephone because
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
utilities are regulated uh but but
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
telecommunication isn't a regulated
 
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.549 align:start position:0%
telecommunication isn't a regulated
industry

00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
so we actually as a legislature as a
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
ways and means came up with
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
first year we came up with how to assess
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
telephone and telecommunication
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
polls and then the next year or two we
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
came up with a way of
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
of uh of evaluating
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
utility properties which includes gas
 
00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:02.630 align:start position:0%
utility properties which includes gas
electric

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
electric
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
and water and we don't have we don't
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
have many public water we do
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
we don't we have very little gas
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
distribution but sometimes do have gas
 
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.710 align:start position:0%
distribution but sometimes do have gas
distribution

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
so um i'll leave it at that thank you it
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
hasn't been simple
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments on the
 
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.710 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments on the
utility

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
utility
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
property tax if not melissa would you go
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
to the interest and dividend tax
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
and that's where we had asked for a
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
breakdown yeah
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
so i think um i'm hoping you had
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
received a couple of weeks ago we gave
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
the breakdown
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the district the different types of
 
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.510 align:start position:0%
of the district the different types of
um

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
components the ind makes up we did a tax
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
year 18 in taxer 19 as well as in your
 
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.030 align:start position:0%
year 18 in taxer 19 as well as in your
presentation

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay perfect but what i think the other
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
question was that has come up a couple
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
of times is the difference between the
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
dividends and distributions for the ind
 
00:49:55.119 --> 00:49:56.630 align:start position:0%
dividends and distributions for the ind
tax

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so looking at this
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
and this is strictly before i speak it's
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
strictly for new hampshire ind purposes
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different than how you
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
typically think of distributions and
 
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.710 align:start position:0%
typically think of distributions and
dividends

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
in the corporate world or for federal
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
purposes so for
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
ind purposes based on statute and rules
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
a distribution distributions are any
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
transfer of property
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
from organizations to owners purely as a
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
result of ownership in a company
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
so those are the distributions and then
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
when you get to dividends
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
dividends are a subset of distributions
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
so a dividend for ind purposes
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
are a type of distribution that are
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
either non-liquidating distributions
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
or are based on current year profit or
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
accumulated profit
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
so if your distribution doesn't fall
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
into those two categories
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's a distribution but if it falls into
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
either a non-liquidated distribution or
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
a current year profit or accumulated
 
00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:58.150 align:start position:0%
a current year profit or accumulated
profit

00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
then it's considered a dividend so a
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
little bit different there so i just
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
clarify that because i know there's been
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions in the last few
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
meetings about the difference between
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
the a distribution and a dividend
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
for the ind tax purposes and
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
the shifting of those looking at a
 
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.549 align:start position:0%
the shifting of those looking at a
10-year

00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
trend and we can get you that chart as
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
well they haven't shifted all that much
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
over the last five
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
years basically interest makes up 13
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
dividends 40 distributions 39
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then exempt federal interest is
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
about 8 percent
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
representatives

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman could you possibly
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
put that
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
on definition in writing
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
and send absolutely it's it's straight
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
from our rules so i can send that over
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
great and then the second uh question is
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
within the bet
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
there is a piece which is uh
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
on distributions it's not called that i
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
think but distributions to
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
owners and partnerships and is it
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
defined the same way or
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax i think it's
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
dividends paid or accrued
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
um is the component that it's paid on i
 
00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:22.950 align:start position:0%
um is the component that it's paid on i
can

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
my assumption is and i'll look it up i
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the same as ind
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
is very specific as to how they um
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
define a dividend um but i will
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
definitely look it up but my assumption
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
is no i think it's going to be a
 
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:36.950 align:start position:0%
is no i think it's going to be a
straight

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
straight
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
um a straight corporate dividend
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
is what's going to be under that
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
dividends um paid or accrued for
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
for bet but i can absolutely send you
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
the answer for that
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
yeah it'd be good to have the
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
definitions for both of those
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind thank you thank you
 
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.230 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind thank you thank you
susan

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
susan
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative randy make sure we
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
understand um
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
so dividends and distributions one are
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
they taxed the same
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
and when are they not taxed the same or
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
sure so they're both taxed at five
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
percent um they just fall into different
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
categories on the form
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
is essentially how it comes down to so
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
they're still being no matter what
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're being
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
taxed to five percent yeah thank you
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
this is a tech this is a question about
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
your your
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
on your in your annual report the
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
inverted pyramid
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
presentation that you do
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
which is a very helpful source of
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
information for all of us
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
but one piece of it that blurs over
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
distinctions that i'd like to be able to
 
00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.190 align:start position:0%
distinctions that i'd like to be able to
see

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
is that your category right in the
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
middle of the chart
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollar of tax reported
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
to ten thousand dollars of tax reported
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
lumps together um
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
people who at the one thousand dollar
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
level have oh let's say
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
um maybe four hundred thousand dollars
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
of uh of uh assets that are producing
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know you can take you can you can
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
assume whatever
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh rate you you want but but it's that
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
kind of level of assets that
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
lead to um a one thousand dollar
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
tax whereas uh for the at the other end
 
00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:42.390 align:start position:0%
tax whereas uh for the at the other end
of

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
of this group of taxpayers
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
receiving ten thousand reporting ten
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of tax
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
you're talking about millions probably
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
unless they had a very lucky year of um
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
holdings that produce the
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
revenue the income that then is taxed at
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
five percent
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
so um my question is whether you have
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
data that would
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
sure um we definitely have the data that
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
makes up those categories and which
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
components are making up those
 
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.750 align:start position:0%
components are making up those
categories

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
categories
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like it might be helpful to
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
take that subset of taxpayers and then
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
maybe make another graph of showing what
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
their components are
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
or what assets they have and that
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're paying taxes on
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
that equal that one thousand to ten
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
thousand that would be really helpful to
 
00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:39.750 align:start position:0%
thousand that would be really helpful to
have

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
from my perspective sure we can get that
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
for the much on the interest and
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
sand none then the tobacco tax
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
sure so the the question you had on tv
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative elmi did you have i'm
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
sorry um we don't have an answer yet
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
dewey about the the um question
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
about the division of how many
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
people at different levels of the
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
um how much money on
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
would be lost if we increase the
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
exemption for the interest and dividends
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
tax by
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
increments sure um devin did a great job
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
last week so i think it's about ready to
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
be sent over so you should have that
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
within the next day
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
great thank you you're welcome thank you
 
00:56:52.319 --> 00:56:54.630 align:start position:0%
great thank you you're welcome thank you
susan

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
susan
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
um so far sorry i have a plow going by i
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's loud
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
um for tobacco attacks for e-cigarettes
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
first off we do have a chart within our
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
monthly report so i'm hoping that
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
the committee members are receiving that
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
chart as well as the new committee
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
members we send out daily charts of
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
revenues after the
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
15th of the month as well as monthly
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
charts at the end of the month
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
that have about i think eight charts in
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
it that further break down our revenues
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
and within one of those charts is a bond
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
receivable balance
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
tobacco chart and at the bottom of that
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
tobacco chart is an e-cigarette chart
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
that shows us the monthly amount of
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
revenue that has been received since
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
implementation of this tax
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
so this tax was implemented
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
um in january and they pay on the
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
following month for this tax in the
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
other tobacco product or otp return
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal year 21 this tax brought
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
in 1.2 million dollars from february to
 
00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.670 align:start position:0%
in 1.2 million dollars from february to
june

00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
june
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
and so far this year from july through
 
00:58:02.319 --> 00:58:03.030 align:start position:0%
and so far this year from july through
january

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
january
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's brought in 2.5 million and it's
 
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.190 align:start position:0%
it's brought in 2.5 million and it's
about

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
300 to 400 000 a month and it seems to
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
vary with a high in october
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
of 458 000
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
um in a low in august of 304 000.
 
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
but right now like i said it's hovering
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
around three to four
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:33.430 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
could i ask a question about that sorry
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's harder to raise my hand that it's
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
just unmute
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh can
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
could we see the variation between the
 
00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
could we see the variation between the
months

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
to see if there's a relationship they're
 
00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.190 align:start position:0%
to see if there's a relationship they're
collecting

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
as they sell aren't they so so
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
if it's a variation according to the
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
coved spurts or something like that
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
sure so in our monthly tobacco chart it
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
does break it out by month
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
oh great and if you need that again just
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
let me know and we can forward just that
 
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.589 align:start position:0%
let me know and we can forward just that
report

00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
saying uh he has his hand up reps and
 
00:59:26.799 --> 00:59:28.390 align:start position:0%
saying uh he has his hand up reps and
major

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative romney as well as
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
represent tucker
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um melissa um anyway you have
 
00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.270 align:start position:0%
thank you um melissa um anyway you have
a

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
you may not have this kind of detail but
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
a split between the open systems and the
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
closed systems
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
the closed systems or the jewels of the
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
world um
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the open system so you refill the
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
canister whatever that
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
device any way of telling because the
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
different tax rates for the two
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking maybe there's a way of
 
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.349 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking maybe there's a way of
telling

00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
how much revenue is due to each one
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
first so we don't currently have a
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
report that does that however we do have
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
that data and that's how we compile the
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
e-cigarette reports so we could pull
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
that together
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
and we can do it from the from the
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
beginning so we can do um february
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
february till now february of last year
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
till now and have it broken out by
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
open system and closed systems per month
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative tucker yes i wanted to
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%

know that you said that i think they'll
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry on i
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
i also i read recently
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think it was in my local paper but
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
maybe not it was an
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
article about uh the e-cigarettes
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
and how on young people were switching
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
to a product that is disposable
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
it is like the closed
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
system but it is disposable and the
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
article made it
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
sound like it was considered
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
untaxable because it was different from
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
the closed
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
system do you know anything about this
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
i am not familiar with that and i have
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
not seen that article but if you'd like
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
to forward that along

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
i was approached and asked to come in
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
and talk a little bit about
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh kind of the state of the hospitality
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
industry uh challenges we've faced
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
um and then talk a little bit about what
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
we see for
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
potentially a year or so ahead of us so
 
01:04:02.319 --> 01:04:02.950 align:start position:0%
potentially a year or so ahead of us so
um

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
i'll just jump right into it but um i
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
believe you received this deck in
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
advance i had sent it to chris
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think late sunday um
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
so obviously i think the the common
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge here is that um the industry
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
has been extremely impacted by
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
the pandemic uh we had the closures in
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
march of 2020
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
and it was a very strong road back from
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
there um
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
the one thing i will say is that you
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
know across the industry
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
not all business models were impacted
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
equally i think it's fair to say that uh
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
business models that were based on more
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
of a takeout and delivery model
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
think of your average uh mcdonald's
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
pizza shop sub shop etc
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh certainly fared much better uh than
 
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.470 align:start position:0%
uh certainly fared much better uh than
casual

01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
casual
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
and fine dining were the biggest uh
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
impacts for we're seeing and then
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
switching gears to lodging you know it's
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
fair to say that the lodging and events
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
side of our industry
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
was dramatically impacted early on um
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
you know again everyone with the
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh safer at home orders uh alike not
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
only here but across the country
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
essentially ground to a whole for a good
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
three or four months there
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
um we did see a little bit of a rebound
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the summer of last year
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
um we did see a fair amount of leisure
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
travel i think the one thing
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
that's worth noting is that corporate
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
travel uh almost disappeared overnight
 
01:05:23.039 --> 01:05:23.670 align:start position:0%
travel uh almost disappeared overnight
so

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
after the first uh sheltered home orders
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
were issued
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
corporate travel has not come back um
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
certainly there's some essential travel
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
but this certainly not
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
certainly not anywhere close to what it
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
has been you know 2019 and earlier and
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
frankly we don't see that really
 
01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.390 align:start position:0%
frankly we don't see that really
recovering

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
recovering
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh fully until sometime in 2024.
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
um just a snapshot you know we estimate
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
that somewhere around 723 million or
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh in gross sales has been lost to the
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
industries about 23
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
and and also keep in mind that uh for
 
01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:56.789 align:start position:0%
and and also keep in mind that uh for
the

01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
for the you know take out delivery
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
restaurants many of those folks were
 
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.270 align:start position:0%
restaurants many of those folks were
certainly

01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
um doing the business they were doing in
 
01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.109 align:start position:0%
um doing the business they were doing in
2019

01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
um casual and and fine dining were down
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
as much as
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know 40 and 50 so again not all
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
business models were equal
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
again we still continue to see roughly 7
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
000 people in our industry
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
percent of our workforce that are uh
 
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.029 align:start position:0%
percent of our workforce that are uh
unemployed

01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
unemployed
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
we continue to see them listed on the
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
continuing claims
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
um what that number doesn't really share
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
with you is the number of folks who are
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
underemployed and we still continue to
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
hear stories from members about
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
businesses that are uh you know uh
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
limited hours
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
or shortened hours or a variety of other
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh accommodations and adjustments that
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
they've made
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
um and then obviously loans and cares
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
act funds have been
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh critical in helping our industry
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
survive to this point
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
um and i'm sure you're all aware as well
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
as i am that uh you know congress
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
continues to wrestle with
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
another uh aid package so we will uh
 
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:55.829 align:start position:0%
another uh aid package so we will uh
wait

01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
wait
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh to see what that looks like um and
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
then the last consideration
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh for you just overall is that you know
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen a dramatic increase in costs
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
of running
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh both restaurants and hotels obviously
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know the providing ppe
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh sanitation sanitizing products and
 
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.470 align:start position:0%
uh sanitation sanitizing products and
protocols

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh energy costs food costs etc
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
everything has gone up
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh across the board so it is not only
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
making less money but it's costing us
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
more to make that money so it has
 
01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
more to make that money so it has
certainly

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
been a challenging uh 12-month period
 
01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.589 align:start position:0%
been a challenging uh 12-month period
here

01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
um specifically to restaurants um
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
again we talked about the the various
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
business models we talked about quick
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
service restaurants have done
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
quite well uh considering um the casual
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
fine dining sector
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
um and then on the workforce
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh one thing that i will share with you
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
is that uh the summer months of last
 
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.150 align:start position:0%
is that uh the summer months of last
year

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
were critically important to the
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
industry the expanded outdoor dining
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
that uh many restaurants took advantage
 
01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:54.390 align:start position:0%
that uh many restaurants took advantage
of

01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
um i can't i can't overstate how
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
important that was to many of them
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh to really just uh shore up the
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
finances and really get through uh to
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
where we are today
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and and we obviously extend our
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
thanks to all the municipalities who
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
went beyond
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
help our restaurants really take
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
advantage of that opportunity
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
um you know whether it was closing up
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
parking spaces with jersey berries and
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
myriad things that all the
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities did to chip in and help
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh was it was a game changer for for
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
many in the industry
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
on the logic side of things um you know
 
01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:29.269 align:start position:0%
on the logic side of things um you know
again

01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
they were closed at 50 percent or closed
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
for a period of time then they opened at
 
01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
for a period of time then they opened at
50

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think we got back to 100 in june of
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
last summer um but again we can see that
 
01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:41.669 align:start position:0%
last summer um but again we can see that
uh

01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
consumer demand demand is down overall
 
01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.030 align:start position:0%
consumer demand demand is down overall
um

01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
and just a couple of numbers that i can
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
share with you our room oxygen
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
rates in 2020 we're down 33 versus 2019
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
and the room revenue was down 41 so
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
not only were fewer people traveling
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
they'll pay less per room so that
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
certainly impacted not only
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
revenues for the industry but it impacts
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
up impacts obviously
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax um again
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
as i stated earlier uh a big a big part
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
the saw were tied directly to
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
um corporate travel that really has just
 
01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:18.229 align:start position:0%
um corporate travel that really has just
evaporated

01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
evaporated
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
um and we talked about the workforce
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
the event side of the history uh
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
obviously they were closed uh i think
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
longer than anyone else um and those
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
severe restrictions continue to be in
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
place event facilities right now which
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
many hotels have event facilities in
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
them but this also includes
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
independent carrying companies uh
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
outside catering companies etc
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
um they're still operating at 50
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
capacity tables of six
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
so that has not changed to date um and
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
due to those restrictions there's a
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
great deal of uncertainty around events
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
for this coming summer
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh one thing i will tell you is uh there
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
are a lot of folks
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
um who potentially postponed weddings or
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be from
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
last year and pushed them into this year
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
that are kind of on the bottle right now
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
there are certainly
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh many of them hoping to to prevents
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
and frankly if you know some of these
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
restrictions are lifted there is a
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
chance that we could have a very good
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
summer for the event side of the
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
industry but
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
um you know as things stand right now
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of uncertainty so
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
we're certainly hopeful that uh we start
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
to get some advanced notice of what
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh easing of restrictions might look
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
like and again i think
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
for all the industries we've spoken to
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's all about the vaccine the faster
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccine can get out there
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
the more likely we will start to see
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence rebound
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
and ultimately start to take advantage
 
01:10:40.719 --> 01:10:40.950 align:start position:0%
and ultimately start to take advantage
of

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
our obviously facilities
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
the the toughest stretch in this entire
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
year really for our industry
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
is right now um you know january
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
february march uh it's the winter time
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
historically slow part of the year we
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
have not had a huge amount of
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
so we've certainly seen um west
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
travelers on the roads
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and i think that's uh played out in
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh toll reports uh that we watch as as
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you do
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
i think we're down 20 or so on most of
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
the highway toll
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
reports um we do anticipate that
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
by second quarter of this year um you
 
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.189 align:start position:0%
by second quarter of this year um you
know

01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
april may june we will see uh some
 
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:20.550 align:start position:0%
april may june we will see uh some
recovery

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
um that's likely going to be in the form
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
of leisure travelers
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit of corporate
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
travel but again i
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be modest at best
 
01:11:29.679 --> 01:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be modest at best
um

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
but we are hopeful that by q3 of this
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
year so
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh july august september we're hoping
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
that there will be some semblance of
 
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:37.910 align:start position:0%
that there will be some semblance of
normal

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
normal
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
we hope that the restaurant hotel and
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
event industries will have a pretty good
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
finish to to the summer season and uh
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
and a decent fall
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned i think the biggest
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh factor in all of this and what the
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
path ahead looks like is really going to
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
be consumer confidence
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
which is really going to be driven by
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
the level of vaccine distribution
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh and the light so um one thing i will
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
say is we do
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
anticipate some pent up demand from
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
leisure travelers dining out
 
01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.669 align:start position:0%
leisure travelers dining out
entertainment

01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
entertainment
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
we expected that will start potentially
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
as soon as uh
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
april may and hopefully go through the
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
rest of the year
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
um but again i think depending on the
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
individual is going to depend on their
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
likelihood that they're going to take
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
advantage of what's available to them
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
um again i think 2021 this year will be
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh much better than last year
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh but certainly uh far behind where we
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
were in 2018 2019
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
and obviously operating costs will
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
continue to be a challenge
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the down and dirty of
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to share with you today
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
i think what um might make more sense is
 
01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:45.990 align:start position:0%
i think what um might make more sense is
uh

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
to try to um try to answer any questions
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mike representative southwood
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
as a question thank you for taking my
 
01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
as a question thank you for taking my
question

01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
i would like to start with a compliment
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm from the dover area
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the restaurants really have been
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
great as far as being creative with
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
delivery outdoor dining all kinds of
 
01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.310 align:start position:0%
delivery outdoor dining all kinds of
things

01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
i do think this is a created a loyalty
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
so i do think when things open up
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
the customers really know where you know
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
people have been serving them well so
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
i do want to compliment the group on
 
01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.709 align:start position:0%
i do want to compliment the group on
that

01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
for my question in the seacoast the bars
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
and pubs are especially popular very
 
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.430 align:start position:0%
and pubs are especially popular very
crowded

01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
crowded
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
but i also know with the virus probably
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
the most risky areas
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
and they'll probably be the last to open
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
up fully
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
well first thank you for your kind words
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
um the industry certainly has been very
 
01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:43.669 align:start position:0%
um the industry certainly has been very
creative

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
creative
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh in trying to work through this issue
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
regarding your question to bars um i
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
think bars i would i would kind of
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
categorize with the event side of things
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
because these are essentially or
 
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.750 align:start position:0%
because these are essentially or
historically

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
spaces where people would kind of crowd
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
together um
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
in you know consolidated numbers uh so
 
01:14:01.679 --> 01:14:01.990 align:start position:0%
in you know consolidated numbers uh so
we

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
we are hopeful again that there's a lot
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
of assumptions in this statement
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
obviously that
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh but if if we do see vaccine
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
distribution continue
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
to uh pick up which we are seeing now
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
starting to take place
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
if what we are hearing from national and
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
state officials that
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know by the time we get into april a
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
fair number of folks will have been
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated especially the high-risk
 
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.630 align:start position:0%
vaccinated especially the high-risk
folks

01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we would start we would
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
think we would start to see that some of
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
those restrictions will begin to ease
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
and then really it's about consumer
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
confidence and and that's the really
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
fickle part of all of this we we can
 
01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:34.709 align:start position:0%
fickle part of all of this we we can
certainly

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh prognosticate about what uh what we
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
think will happen
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
based on vaccine distribution based on a
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
variety of things but
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's really going to boil down to when
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
are consumers ready to come out
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh and dine out and and that's that's
 
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.390 align:start position:0%
uh and dine out and and that's that's
the

01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
million-dollar question i guess a
 
01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.030 align:start position:0%
million-dollar question i guess a
follow-up

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah actually i guess it's kind of a
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
follow off but
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of the um places
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
that will not reopen
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
do you kind of have that on your radar
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
so that's a very difficult question to
 
01:15:07.199 --> 01:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
so that's a very difficult question to
answer

01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure you can imagine you know
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
historically the restaurant industry has
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
a fair and a fair amount of turnover in
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
a good year
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
so we will certainly see a number of
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
restaurants will come in number of
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
restaurants will go out
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
um we have been trying to keep a track
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
or an idea of how many businesses we
 
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.030 align:start position:0%
or an idea of how many businesses we
think

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
have gone out dude directly related to
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic versus just you know
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
operational challenges whatever it might
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
be and frankly
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we're ever going to
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
get to that number uh in a clean fashion
 
01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:34.870 align:start position:0%
get to that number uh in a clean fashion
so

01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know we saw an awful lot of
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant owners in the early part of
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemic who just retired
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know they were within three or four
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
years of their target retirement anyway
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
and they realized that they could spend
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of time effort resources
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
trying to survive and come back from
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
this pandemic and they made the decision
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
that they're just going to retire so we
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
what's not clear to me is of the group
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we saw that did the hibernations
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me how many of those
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
are going to come back and there were a
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
fair number of them in the seacoast
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so you know there's a couple of
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
challenges there first of all
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
when you close the restaurant for three
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
months it's essentially the same as
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
reopening your business from scratch
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
you've got to have the capital and the
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to you know purchase
 
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.070 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to you know purchase
inventory

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
hiring trained staff you're essentially
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
starting from from zero
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and what also is concerning to to me
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the industry is
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at uh our workforce
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
if you've essentially
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
sideline them for three or four months
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
will they become back to your business
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
um and we're not sure about that there
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
is obviously
 
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
a number of other industries that have
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
been functioning quite well
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing healthcare and others
 
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:45.830 align:start position:0%
manufacturing healthcare and others
they're

01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
desperate for help right now so how many
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
of uh how what percentage of our
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
workforce will make the decision to
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
switch careers
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
again there are a lot of questions there
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that i have any uh
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
serious and solid answers for you
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately thank you that was helpful
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay before we go to represent all me i
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
do have a question for you mike
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
do you know of many restaurants that
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
started the restaurant in say
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
october and november 2019 because of
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
starting in 2019 we're not
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for ppe loans and therefore
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
they haven't been able to survive were
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
there many
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
of these type of an eligible ppp
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
loans so couple of points
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh to make so uh we we are aware of
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants and even some hotels who
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
essentially had open dates there was a
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
hotel right here in concord their open
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
date was supposed to be april of 2020.
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
i don't believe they open until
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
something like october of 2020 so
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh we've certainly seen a lot of
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
businesses that opened or were ready to
 
01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:51.750 align:start position:0%
businesses that opened or were ready to
open

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know october november uh 2019
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
even through the you know summer of last
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
year that were essentially forced to
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
open simply because they had
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of capital and and lease
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
obligations that they had to to meet so
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
so we're certainly seeing a lot of
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
businesses in that space and they've
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
been a lot of businesses to
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
to appoint mr chairman that we're not
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for ppp
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
loans uh thankfully there were some
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
other instruments that they could
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
access so for example the economic
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
injury and disaster loans the idle loans
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
those were available and many of them
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
were able to get it to get those
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately those businesses that
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
did not qualify for ppp loans
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
many of them did also also did not
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for cares act funds so therefore
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
they were not able to get main street
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
relief the cell funds or whatever it
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
might be so
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
there have been a lot of businesses that
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
have kind of fallen through the cracks
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know i don't have a hard number
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
for you but that certainly has been
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
something that we've been watching
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
we have been in touch with our
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
congressional delegation we've asked
 
01:18:48.239 --> 01:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
congressional delegation we've asked
them

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
as part of the next round of aid that is
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
being talked about right now that
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
there be some carve out that would be
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
specifically helpful to those newer
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
businesses who started
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
late 2019 early 2020 that uh
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
have received no support thus far or
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
very little support
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
that there'd be some set aside or some
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility that would allow them to
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
access some additional funds
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
again i'm of the opinion that the
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
businesses that can make it to
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know memorial day weekend or a
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
little later i think that if they can
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
make it to there they've made it across
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
the finish line i think they got a
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
chance to make it uh
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
and survive um but you know this is a
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
really critical time for a lot of
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
businesses they've
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
they've spent the aid that they've
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
gotten they've many of them have burned
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
through a lot of their personal equity
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
in these businesses
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot left in the till so
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to need a little bit to
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
get them over the finish line and
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
whatever bit that they get if we can get
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
them to memorial day i think they've got
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
a legitimate shot of making it through
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
this mess so
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
like when we when when businesses
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
open up uh reps restaurants are lodging
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
do they automatically join your
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
association can you can you
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
track all of them or on is it just the
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
ones that decide to
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
that is a good thing to join uh thank
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
i wish that was the case that is
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not the case um
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
like a lot of chambers of commerce etc
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
it is a uh
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
an option um we certainly encourage
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
folks to join us uh we give them timely
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
information variety of other products
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
and services but
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement that they join
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
the organization so unfortunately i
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
really hard numbers that i can share
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
with you thank you and as
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
to follow up on do you have an idea of
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
the normal churn
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
i've been thinking that that on after
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
when things start to be
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
safe a lot more people might be coming
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
out and trying their hand at
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
restauranting and i know a number of
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
people that
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
have set up on restaurants now
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
because but are there they're they're
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
only working with themselves
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
not with any any workers yet because
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
there isn't much demand yet
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
um do you have an idea of the normal
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
churn how many
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
leave and how many start
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it fluctuates by years i'm sure you
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
can imagine but we anticipated somewhere
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
around 10 or 15 percent
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
um and and you know in good years like
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
2019 it may be as low as three four five
 
01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:19.830 align:start position:0%
2019 it may be as low as three four five
percent

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
and other years more challenging years
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
could be a little higher
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
um but but ultimately that's a range
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
that we see
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
um you know into your question or your
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
following question about
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh how many restaurants uh hotels do we
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate are going to open
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of uh plans are on hold
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
right now i think that
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
um there will likely be some opportunity
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
where some businesses
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately closed as a result of the
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic so there will be some that
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
have the wherewithal that may think this
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
is a great opportunity but
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
i do suspect that it's going to be later
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
this year before
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
much later this year before i think a
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
lot of folks are going to jump in
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
we're certainly seeing some smaller uh
 
01:21:58.239 --> 01:21:59.110 align:start position:0%
we're certainly seeing some smaller uh
uh

01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
folks start up right now specifically
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
around a lot of grab and go type stuff
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know coffee shops and things like
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
that but to see a full-blown you know
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
sit-down restaurant
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant or hotel i suspect it's going
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
to be linked this year before they even
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
consider something like that
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative romney thank you summers
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
good to see you again um so my
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
question's about corporate travel
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
and whether there's going to be a new
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
normal um
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
i think eventually conferences and
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
conventions will come back that
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
involve businesses because of the
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
socialization part of it people like
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
going and meeting their peers
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
working other companies and all that but
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
that may take a little bit of time
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to normal business
 
01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.110 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to normal business
travel

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
travel
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
and after a year of zooms
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate that there will be
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
less corporate travel
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
as the new norm and that zooming will
 
01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:55.590 align:start position:0%
as the new norm and that zooming will
continue

01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
now that impacts everything then that
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
impacts car rentals meals and hotels
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
if i'm going from here to new york city
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
a conference with a client a meeting
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
with a client that
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
well you know maybe we could just do
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
this by zoom
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
so have you thought about that much in
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just just trying to figure out a
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
little bit as to whether you think
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
there may be a new norm in travel
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
business travel
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's a great question representative
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
obama thank you question um
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
my sense of it is that we're gonna have
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
a tale here i i think what's gonna
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
happen is we will likely continue to be
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
a zoom culture for a lot of business
 
01:23:32.639 --> 01:23:33.510 align:start position:0%
a zoom culture for a lot of business
meetings

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh for the next six to 12 months but i
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
really think that there's something to
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
be said for the personal touch right so
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
when you talk about a sales call
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know investment meeting whatever
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
it might be
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
we do anticipate that we'll come back uh
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
we just
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
anticipate it's gonna come back in a big
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
way until probably 2022
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
maybe 2023 um and i think it's going to
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
vary by industry it's going to vary by
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
corporate culture it's going to vary by
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of factors
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
but i think that folks do like to get
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
together um you know
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's the wine and dying scenario that
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
we've all heard of so
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
um we think it will come back but we
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
just do think it will be delayed
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and we certainly think it's going to
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
impact obviously
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
industry revenues and state revenues at
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
least for the next six to 12 months at
 
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.590 align:start position:0%
least for the next six to 12 months at
least

01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
summers for coming in to talk to us
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
today i just have a comment
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
um you know for 25 years i worked as one
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
of those business travelers i left every
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
sunday and came back home every thursday
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i was
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
in planes and trains and automobiles and
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
hotels and taxis and
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
everything that you can think of by
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
modes of transportation and places to
 
01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.149 align:start position:0%
modes of transportation and places to
say

01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants eating out every night um i
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
spoke this past week
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
with the president of the corporation
 
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
that i retired from
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
and i asked him particularly about
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
this and that company has now created a
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
new business model
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh that there's a certain portion of
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
their consultants
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
that will no longer be traveling they
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
will only be doing
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
a business by in the same fashion that
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're speaking right now
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh they said that that
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
while they will have some people that
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
are going out to do that personal touch
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
just as you were talking about just now
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
that they are create they have created
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
and they have a business model that is
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
working very well
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
and this is a 100 million dollar company
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
that had you know 70 employees that flew
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
all over the place every week
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
now the way the health crisis has
 
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.110 align:start position:0%
now the way the health crisis has
affected

01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
affected
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh all of us in the united states we are
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
seeing business models that are being
 
01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.550 align:start position:0%
seeing business models that are being
formed

01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
formed
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
that are sort of cutting out this
 
01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:52.550 align:start position:0%
that are sort of cutting out this
completely

01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i know that this is going to have a
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
definite impact
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make that statement
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
just to say that we are talking to other
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
people in the industries
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh and and i agree with you that it's
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
going to be a while before it's going to
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
come back
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
and it's probably not going to come back
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
also thank you for the comment and and i
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
i do agree that there are going to be a
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
large companies that are going to be
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
very hesitant to travel but
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
i i think the reason we always had
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
corporate travel was that the
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
the personal touch was ultimately the
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
more successful right
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
so uh you whine and die in a client you
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know you talked through it you
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
built a personal relationship with them
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
and and frankly i think that the folks
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
that continue to adopt that will likely
 
01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.189 align:start position:0%
that continue to adopt that will likely
be

01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
the more successful and so you are right
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
going to be a long tail there will
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
likely be
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh varying versions of the business
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
model you describe and i absolutely
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
but i think that ultimately again
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to be
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
a personal touch and frankly i think
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
that that will ultimately win the day
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we ended up with the
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
corporate culture that we've had because
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
it has been successful for
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
for very very long period of time
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any any further questions
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
chris um at this point you have nobody
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled until 11 o'clock
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
at that point you'll have the new
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing finance authority
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if you want to address
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
any of the outstanding taxes you have or
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
revisit any of the taxes that
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
revenues excuse me that you discussed
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
last week why don't you
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
know the communication services because
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
you were waiting for a response from the
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
department today
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh you provided an updated
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and i can share that with the
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes uh if there's any
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
if there's no questions at this point
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
if there isn't then go ahead press um
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
well you have two questions reps of
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
major uh season represent major you have
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
reps of a bromine
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
represent army oh representative put his
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
hand down
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i wanted to bring up that
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
newspaper article that i shared with
 
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:19.990 align:start position:0%
newspaper article that i shared with
everybody

01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
last week and it would be that probably
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
dra is left
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
but on it seems to give
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
a very good on reasons
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
reasons for why we're seeing the revenue
 
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.470 align:start position:0%
reasons for why we're seeing the revenue
increases

01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
increases
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
that that we have been seeing throughout
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and that the whole country
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
has or
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
apparently some states not but have been
 
01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.910 align:start position:0%
apparently some states not but have been
seeing

01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
on and i think that it's going to be
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
worth discussing at some point
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you any
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments before
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%

01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay chris so on
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
friday i believe i sent out the revised
 
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.310 align:start position:0%
friday i believe i sent out the revised
worksheet

01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
worksheet
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
um where i included the governor's
 
01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.070 align:start position:0%
um where i included the governor's
estimates

01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
these estimates don't um reflect any
 
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.629 align:start position:0%
these estimates don't um reflect any
changes

01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
that are being made as you know the tax
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
changes or any other
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
suggested revenue impacts these are just
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers pulled from
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
um the information i sent you which was
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
the exhibit b
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
from the budget which is the
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues as well as the
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
executive summary it could
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
respect both current law and
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
and is this right so it's not just
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
current law that you're looking at and
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i do have a document from the
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
um that i haven't had a chance to fully
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
go through
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
but um it's what matt will present to
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
you on
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
thursday it'll break out um
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
you'll have a base estimate and it'll
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
break out what the changes the impact of
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
those revenue changes might be for
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
for instance the business tax the bet um
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
threshold changing and
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
the bet um decreasing the rate to 5.55
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
um so just but i felt the committee
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
might want to see
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
at least some information as you're
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
talking about this
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i think it's um it's probably good
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know as you go across you can see
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
your numbers aren't
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know the agency high lows are not
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
really out of whack compared to what the
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
governor estimates show you
 
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
or even what you agreed to last week
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you may not want to
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
revisit some of these but it's
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to get that to the committee
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
that if there was any um
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
questions as to how the governor was
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
lining up with his estimates compared to
 
01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.070 align:start position:0%
lining up with his estimates compared to
what

01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
the agencies were sharing with you as
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
well as what you came to some
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
conclusions on last week
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
when we meet with the governor's budget
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
director on thursday
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
he knows we want to be able to have him
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
tell us what part of
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
his estimate his current law and what
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
and and what is it all right and
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
estimates

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
and he's provided that to me represent
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
major i just had
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's not um i didn't want to send out
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
another document because it doesn't
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
compare to this document in front of you
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
um because in this document
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
you have some things that i've adjusted
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
for that aren't adjusted in some of the
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
base numbers that
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
i got from the mat the other day so i
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
just want to go through and make sure i
 
01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.870 align:start position:0%
just want to go through and make sure i
don't

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
i clean it up so that it looks similar
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
to what you've been looking at and then
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
explain where there's changes
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
for instance the anomalies the 30.8
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars in anomalies
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
information that i got from the
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
subtracts that at the end of their
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
estimate so it's not done by each tax
 
01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:57.510 align:start position:0%
estimate so it's not done by each tax
type

01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
type
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
where in your in this case what i
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
provided you for the agency
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
high and low it is accounted for already
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
so instead of at the end of the process
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
i've done it on the front side of it
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
so but by by the end of tomorrow you'll
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
get a document so that you can
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
see what the governor's um estimates are
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of current law and as well as
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
what they are it relates to any changes
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
that they're going to put in
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
um house bill 2 or the trailer bill
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
and the trailer bill is not ready it
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
won't be ready for a short bit
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
um the governor's office did provide
 
01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.830 align:start position:0%
um the governor's office did provide
language

01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
um as required for the chapter law last
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
budget session
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
um but similar to any lsr it's now with
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and has to go through ols
 
01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.070 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and has to go through ols
and

01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
um language has to be cleaned up to kind
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
of fit what ols does for
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
drafting but hopefully we'll have that
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know within a short period of time
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
does the
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
trailer bill is that up-to-date
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
on those things that affect revenues
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
um yes it will it has the language you
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
know or or what the
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
um governor intends to do with his
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
budget as he would
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
need to make it work um what
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's a draft though it's not done in the
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
ols format as you would see a
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
build being introduced so that ols needs
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
to go through that process of looking at
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
what changes are being recommended
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
and checking statutes current statutes
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
seeing what needs to change
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that all the referencing and
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
cross-referencing is correct and
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what takes some time so
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
when we meet with the governor on
 
01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.709 align:start position:0%
when we meet with the governor on
thursday

01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
thursday
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
yeah uh i think i'm unmuted um
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
so uh the the the question is
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
the question you've basically that
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
you've been putting out there
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
is house bill 2 and changes uh
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
from current law that are somehow
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
embedded in
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimates and you just
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
brought up another wrinkle which is the
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
treatment of the anomalies
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
so i just i just wanted to say i almost
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
took my hand down but
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
it really it's absolutely essential that
 
01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.669 align:start position:0%
it really it's absolutely essential that
we

01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
get that information i'm glad that you
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
have a document that will allow
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
i guess you to share what your sense of
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
how the governor's non-current law
 
01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:41.990 align:start position:0%
how the governor's non-current law
pieces

01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
play into his estimates but we really
 
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:45.590 align:start position:0%
play into his estimates but we really
can't

01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
look at at his numbers say for
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
all meals and rooms or business taxes or
 
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.830 align:start position:0%
all meals and rooms or business taxes or
ind

01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
ind
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
and understand it at all without having
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
that information correct
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's one of the main reasons we're
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
meeting with the governor's budget
 
01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.390 align:start position:0%
meeting with the governor's budget
director

01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
the regular revenue estimates getting
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
what all the additions to the revenues
 
01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:16.790 align:start position:0%
what all the additions to the revenues
are

01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
so so if i might i mean
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's budget director will
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
will discuss with you um
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know the changes and the estimates
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
that they have related to the the
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
changes that they want in the
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
make related to the tax laws um and
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
the document he provided me does break
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
that out um
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
the anomalies are there what i'm trying
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
to do is be consistent in the approach
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
that you see the numbers so you don't
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
see two different numbers and wonder if
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
there's an error or a mistake
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'm also checking the numbers as they
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
you know i compare them to what
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
matt has in his document he provided me
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
last night as compared to what the
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
governor issued on last thursday
 
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that there was no what i
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
would call fat finger you know of
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
information being a number and being
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
omitted or
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
or transposed by accident so just it's
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
cleaning it up making sure that the
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know if the committee
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
members that were here last session
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
if you remember the document that um
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
i had created was an excel document that
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
had basically the base estimate numbers
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
at the top half of the page and at the
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
bottom half of the page were where
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
um there were changes to current law yes
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
how the
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
budget director set it up for me based
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
on my request to him and
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'll end up providing to
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
the committee so it should be
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
in that sense you just may not see
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
language in house bill 2 but you have
 
01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:43.350 align:start position:0%
language in house bill 2 but you have
the

01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
elements of what's changing based on the
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
summary document that you should have
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
all received in the mail or will receive
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
in the mail
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
um you know it basically describes some
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
of the changes that
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
the governor is recommending and matt
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
will be able to address committee's
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
well this is a good starting point uh
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
for uh thursday
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh you have representative all on me and
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative bromi that have questions
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
represent major
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative followed by
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman chris
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
when when you get hb2
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
on you're going to be going through it
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure to see
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
what sections are relative to
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
our revenues and that
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
would include anything that turns into a
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund or comes out of a
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
on can you possibly
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
maybe hb2 or something like that provide
 
01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.149 align:start position:0%
maybe hb2 or something like that provide
us

01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
an index to the page numbers that those
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
are on because
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
it is sometimes even the analysis
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't use the same words
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
so that you can't search on the computer
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
easily for the place that is in the
 
01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.470 align:start position:0%
easily for the place that is in the
analysis

01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
so the answer is yes representative only
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
and typically our office does put
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
together an index to house bill 2.
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
usually it's just on the in the budget
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
documents on on our website
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
but what i can do when we do that is i
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
can notate for the committee those um
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
sections that you may have an interest
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
in looking at and and i'll email that to
 
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.070 align:start position:0%
in looking at and and i'll email that to
the

01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
entire committee when it's available so
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
i would just say you know i would do
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
something like you know sections
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
two through four address the change in
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
sections blah and it'll be i'll
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
highlight the index for you
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
so you can find it easily very good
 
01:38:45.199 --> 01:38:49.189 align:start position:0%
so you can find it easily very good
representative

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um you know even though
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have hb2 in front of us on
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
thursday let's say
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm assuming that the governor's uh
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
budget fellow knows that
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know what the tax cuts are and he
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
will describe them to us
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
um i mean uh you know yeah i agree with
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative army that it'd be nice to
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
have it referenced
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
so we can double check that it's correct
 
01:39:11.119 --> 01:39:12.550 align:start position:0%
so we can double check that it's correct
eventually

01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh but i think what he looking here on
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
thursday is pretty much
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
what it's going to be unless he forgets
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
to put something in that that is an hb2
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh so is that is that correct that would
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
be correct representative abrami i mean
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
matt will be able to talk to you about
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know what their plans are with the
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
say you know the business enterprise tax
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
and when they
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know intend for that to have an
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
impact on your revenues and
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
you know um you know the interest in
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
dividends and what they're proposing for
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
that he'll be able to talk you through
 
01:39:41.679 --> 01:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
that he'll be able to talk you through
that

01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
um you just don't have a document
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of you that
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
states that as well that will come after
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
the fact and again it's just a timing
 
01:39:49.679 --> 01:39:50.149 align:start position:0%
the fact and again it's just a timing
issue

01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's the governor's office provided
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
everything like they were
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
expected to by yesterday afternoon
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
now it's just a matter of getting it um
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
through the lsr
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
type of process getting it drafted into
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
and and that process there may be some
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
things that are in the
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know the uh document that was
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
provided that may end up in other places
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know that for instance there might
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
be a reference to a capital project
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it needs to go to house bill 25
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
and not stay in the trailer bill you
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
know so those are the types of things
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
that we're in the process of trying to
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
look at we again we've just gotten it so
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
um our office hasn't really had a chance
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
to really go through it yet
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up norm we'll follow up
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
so it'd be helpful in the documents that
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
he shared with us on thursday
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
would have a little guide as to what the
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
tax was and the
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
applicability dates of some of these tax
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's effective uh tax periods
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
ending or
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh or after a certain date or you know
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
that we haven't hard copy yep i'll i'll
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
make that request to matt
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the worksheet
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be discussing on
 
01:41:08.719 --> 01:41:13.350 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be discussing on
thursday

01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
if not then
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
at 11 o'clock just one other thing
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative just to update the
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
committee i still don't have anybody
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
from health and human services
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
um i reached out i've reached out almost
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
every single day last week
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
and um at this point i still don't have
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
a name to come before the committee
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
they might give me something today or
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and if they do i'll schedule
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
them for
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
thursday as well um
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
but at this point we have nobody coming
 
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:47.600 align:start position:0%

um you know with the numbers you know
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
most recently compared to what was
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
happening so but again i just want to
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
let the committee know
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
i've continued to work on that i just
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
don't have a response from the
 
01:42:04.239 --> 01:42:07.590 align:start position:0%
don't have a response from the
department

01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
let's talk off offline on that chris

doesn't look like we were going to be
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
meeting this afternoon because
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%

is joining me as well i know he spoke
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
with you earlier in the year
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the opportunity to chat
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
with you today
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
um i think we did provide as
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
chris requested some data some of which
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
is basically
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
um updates of information that you saw
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
earlier in the year some of which is
 
02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:21.270 align:start position:0%
earlier in the year some of which is
design

02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
design
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
we hope to address some of the specific
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
questions that we were asked to try to
 
02:00:25.599 --> 02:00:26.470 align:start position:0%
questions that we were asked to try to
address

02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we're able to um to
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
identify information to do that
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
if i may what i might ask is if
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
ben can share his screen we will go
 
02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:39.270 align:start position:0%
ben can share his screen we will go
through

02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
these charts quickly and then obviously
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
either he or i will
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
be happy to try to answer your questions
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
so um if that's all right
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes it will be thank you sir
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
so um we'll start just quickly here i
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
know that the focus of the
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
the conversation we want to have today i
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
that i can see what i'm apologize about
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
the um the focus of the conversation
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
today is really the
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
the for sale side of the market but i
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
did want to just start by setting a
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
little context reminding
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
everyone of the dynamics of our rental
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%
market as well because
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
there are interconnectivities here and
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
what goes on in the rental market does
 
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:28.709 align:start position:0%
what goes on in the rental market does
impact

02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
the for sale or purchase market as well
 
02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.149 align:start position:0%
the for sale or purchase market as well
so

02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
um just quickly i know ben shared some
 
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
of this information with the committee
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
earlier in the year but
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
we track rental costs on an annual basis
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
through a very comprehensive survey
 
02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
on a statewide basis as well as
 
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
regionally and you will note that
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
the trend that we have identified really
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
over more than a decade continues
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh which is that the cost of rental
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
units in the state continues to
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
increase uh they have increased um
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
pretty steadily over that decade or so
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
and in the last five years
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
the increase has been about 22 percent
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
for a two-bedroom unit which is really
 
02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:08.629 align:start position:0%
for a two-bedroom unit which is really
the

02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
sort of marker um unit that we use
 
02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
because that's the
 
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
most of the rental units in the state
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
are two bedrooms
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
the importance of this is that that rate
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
of increase is probably about
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
twice the rate of increase in renter
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
incomes and therefore
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
it has created affordability challenges
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
for people and that's relevant for the
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
purchase side of the market because it
 
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
really undermines the ability of people
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
who might be trying to save
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
to purchase home because it basically
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
increases demands on them and
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
their ability to pay for
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
and undermines their ability to pay for
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
their housing generally
 
02:02:48.790 --> 02:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
next sideband if you can please the
 
02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:49.189 align:start position:0%
next sideband if you can please the
other

02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
factor here that is important to
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
recognize and really contributes to that
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
increasing rental cost
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
is the um is the vacancy rate and we
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
have an extraordinarily low
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in new hampshire we've been
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
sort of trend as you can see for a
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
and have been below both what what is
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
generally identified as a balanced
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
market level which is about five percent
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
and below what people would describe as
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
turnover rate which is about three
 
02:03:16.719 --> 02:03:17.589 align:start position:0%
turnover rate which is about three
percent

02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
for a number of years last year we
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
actually that is 2019 we actually hit
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
um a a really low point under one
 
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:26.790 align:start position:0%
um a a really low point under one
percent

02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the number bounced back a little
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
bit uh we think partly
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
because of pandemic related issues and
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
partly because of some new production in
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
but the reality here is that our vacancy
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
rate is extremely low which means
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's a very tight market there's a lot
 
02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
of competition for rental units
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it continues to to press uh prices
 
02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:48.069 align:start position:0%
and it continues to to press uh prices
upward

02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
upward
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
dean what do you mean by turnover rate
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
turnover rate turnover means really the
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
notion that units aren't really vacant
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
it is um
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
the time it takes to move somebody out
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
and perhaps
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
um fix up a unit a little bit and move
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
somebody in
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
so the unit might be vacant for um days
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
or even a couple of weeks while that
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
goes on
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative but it's not really a
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
vacancy in the context that
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
um you know the unit is vacant and
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
people are trying to rent it
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um and so turnover rate really
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
means for all intents and purposes there
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
is no vacancy um
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
moving to the next slide i guess ben to
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
really focus on and the next one
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
um the focus on really what you asked us
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
to talk about which is a for sale market
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to start really by talking
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
about closed
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
sales really the volume of sales
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
activity and we're
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
showing you three years worth of data
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
spread out over the over a six-month
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
cycle and
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we gave you only six
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
months of 2020 is because
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
there really are two stories for 2020.
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
the first half of the year
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
had some impact in the spring associated
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic when there was kind of
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
like a forced
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
um reduction in sales activity because
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the stay-at-home order
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
and other related factors once that kind
 
02:05:14.239 --> 02:05:14.790 align:start position:0%
and other related factors once that kind
of

02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
changed and we got into mid-summer the
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
volume of sales
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
increased significantly and as you can
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
tell from that light blue bar
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
um the sales activity in 2020 was was
 
02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.149 align:start position:0%
um the sales activity in 2020 was was
higher

02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
higher
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
and virtually every month for the second
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
half of the year than it was in either
 
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
of the previous two years
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
what's really interesting here is is the
 
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
numbers for october
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
and november and especially december
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
when sales activity tends to slow down
 
02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:42.470 align:start position:0%
when sales activity tends to slow down
traditionally

02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
traditionally
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
um in the for sale market and really
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
that did not happen
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
in a significant sense in 2020 and i
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
think most realtors would tell you that
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
the end of last calendar year was much
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
stronger than
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
they are historically um used to seeing
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
um sales activity in december of 2020
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
was actually
 
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
26 percent higher than the year before
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
which in turn was substantially higher
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
than the year before that
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
so showing a very strong market a lot of
 
02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.270 align:start position:0%
so showing a very strong market a lot of
demand

02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
demand
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
for what housing is actually available
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
in um
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
with that level of demand um and we'll
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
look at inventory in a moment
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
comes upward pressure on pricing and
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's pretty
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
straightforward here the little squiggly
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
bluish line
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
um shows prices month to month and there
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
is some
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
seasonality and variability that goes on
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the overall trend
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
line which is the gold if you will or
 
02:06:40.079 --> 02:06:40.870 align:start position:0%
line which is the gold if you will or
yellow

02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
yellow
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
dotted line you can tell that purchase
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
prices have been
 
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
trending upward upward pretty
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
consistently since about 2013.
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
um and in december of 2020 we hit a new
 
02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:51.910 align:start position:0%
um and in december of 2020 we hit a new
peak

02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
peak
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
for median purchase price particularly
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
in the winter time
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
frame of 340 000
 
02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
which was about a 17 increase over the
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
same time
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
last year um
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
one of the motivating factors one of the
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
contributing factors to this
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
is again a supply problem um
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
not unlike the rental side of the market
 
02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:19.830 align:start position:0%
not unlike the rental side of the market
inventory

02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
of of homes for sale is extremely low it
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
has been trending downward
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh for what is now basically of 12 or 14
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
years the black line shows total
 
02:07:30.079 --> 02:07:30.870 align:start position:0%
years the black line shows total
listings

02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
listings
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
on the market um the the teal or or blue
 
02:07:34.159 --> 02:07:34.629 align:start position:0%
on the market um the the teal or or blue
line

02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
is listings under 300 000 we use that as
 
02:07:38.159 --> 02:07:38.629 align:start position:0%
is listings under 300 000 we use that as
a

02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a benchmark for entry-level
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh housing because one of our focus
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
points as an organization
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
is first-time buyers and helping them
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
get in the market
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
and and the orange line is
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
listings that are over hundred thousand
 
02:07:53.679 --> 02:07:54.470 align:start position:0%
listings that are over hundred thousand
dollars

02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
you will note a couple of points there
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh first listings overall
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
are continuing to decline secondly that
 
02:08:01.199 --> 02:08:01.990 align:start position:0%
are continuing to decline secondly that
listings

02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
listings
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
um below three hundred thousand three
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand and below
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
um crossed if you will with the ones
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
above that number
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
in early 2019 for the first time in this
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
this trend line of over 14 years um and
 
02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
both continue to decline so the number
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
of units available for sale
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
is is very limited and there's a lot of
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
demand for them they
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
turn very fast if you go to the next
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
slide ben
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
we can see that um even more starkly
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:08:37.189 --> 02:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of inventory so in the for sale
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
market inventory
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
is described in terms of months
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
of inventory meaning how long would it
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
take to
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
sell all of the units that are on the
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
market at the current
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
pace of sales if no new units were to be
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
added to the market and you can see that
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
again there's some seasonality to it
 
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that once we get into
 
02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:58.629 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that once we get into
2020

02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
um it is relatively flat and it is
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
showing a
 
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
inventory of about one month really
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
depending on whether you're looking at
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
again um under 300
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
000 or over 300 000 or the total market
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
um i think anybody in the real estate
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
business will tell you that a one month
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
inventory of homes for sale is
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily low it is outside
 
02:09:22.639 --> 02:09:23.990 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily low it is outside
anyone's

02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
anyone's
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
experience in recent memory um and it
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
really means that
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
literally most homes go on the market
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
they sell within 30 to 45 days
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
there is enormous competition for what
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
is on the market and that does have the
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
effect of pushing up prices
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
as we saw earlier next slide ben now one
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the contributing factors to this
 
02:09:51.270 --> 02:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
um is also very low interest rates and
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
i think everybody's aware that mortgage
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
interest rates are
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
extremely low they are at historic low
 
02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:57.830 align:start position:0%
extremely low they are at historic low
levels

02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
levels
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
um january the 2.73 is an is an index of
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh takes a variety of different sources
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
and and looks at it it's
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
really the rate that uh for a 30-year
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
fixed rate that someone with good credit
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh would be able to access
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
um but there are rates out there
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
depending on the term
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
of a loan that you want to take as low
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
as around two percent and perhaps
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
topping out into the mid to high threes
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that all of those
 
02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
rates are extraordinarily low compared
 
02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:27.109 align:start position:0%
rates are extraordinarily low compared
to

02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
historic rates so one of the factors
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
here is that
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
it has increased in that context
 
02:10:32.639 --> 02:10:33.510 align:start position:0%
it has increased in that context
affordability

02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
prices are going up so that reduces
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
affordability but
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
interest rates are down and that
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
mitigates that effect a little bit
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
but it also is encouraging people to buy
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
a home
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
because they're looking at an
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to lock in a very low
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
interest rate
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
in this environment that they may not
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
see again um
 
02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
in their experience uh next slide then
 
02:10:55.119 --> 02:10:57.270 align:start position:0%
in their experience uh next slide then
please

02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
i did want to um perhaps
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
um share this information with you
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
though because i think it's a
 
02:11:08.229 --> 02:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's an unknown um and and i you know i
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
don't really know what the implications
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
of this are going to be
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
for the mortgage markets for the sales
 
02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
markets going forward as we go into the
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
year this is delinquency data obviously
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's national data but
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
we can tell you that new hampshire's
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
data is very similar it's a little
 
02:11:24.719 --> 02:11:25.350 align:start position:0%
data is very similar it's a little
better

02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
but not dramatically better than these
 
02:11:27.599 --> 02:11:28.629 align:start position:0%
but not dramatically better than these
numbers

02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and what this really represents is a
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
really significant uptick in delinquency
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
as we got into 2020
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
um but it's important to keep in mind
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
that it's probably not
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
real delinquency what do i mean by that
 
02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:41.910 align:start position:0%
real delinquency what do i mean by that
in

02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
about a year ago in march of last year
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
congress passed the cares act as you
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
recall and
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
one of the elements of that was a
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
provision that said that that um
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
mortgage holders who had a loan that had
 
02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
some connection to the federal
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
government meaning
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
fannie mae loans freddie mac loans uh
 
02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.189 align:start position:0%
fannie mae loans freddie mac loans uh
fha

02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
fha
 
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
and ginny may and short loans could ask
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
for uh forbearance meaning deferral of
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
their mortgage payment
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh for between six and 12 months uh
 
02:12:14.109 --> 02:12:14.119 align:start position:0%
simply by saying that they had a
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
covet-related issue
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
that impacted their ability to pay
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
without any sort of additional
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
proof or validation um and a number of
 
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
people across the country have taken
 
02:12:24.639 --> 02:12:25.270 align:start position:0%
people across the country have taken
advantage

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
of that provision um technically they
 
02:12:28.079 --> 02:12:28.310 align:start position:0%
of that provision um technically they
are

02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
delinquent because their mortgage
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
payments are not being made
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
even though it's not a traditional form
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
of delinquency
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
and you'll note with that blue line
 
02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
there that
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
is particularly high among fha
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
related loans which is the federal
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
housing administration's guarantee
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
program which tends to
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
target first-time buyers and
 
02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:51.430 align:start position:0%
target first-time buyers and
lower-income

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
lower-income
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
buyers perhaps relative to others but
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
even for all
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
categories to cause the significant
 
02:12:57.199 --> 02:12:58.470 align:start position:0%
categories to cause the significant
uptick

02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
uptick
 
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
in apparent delinquencies we don't
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
really know what the implications of
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
this are going to be over the next 12
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
months and you may actually have heard
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
read yesterday and today that the
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
decided to extend the ability for people
 
02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:14.069 align:start position:0%
decided to extend the ability for people
to

02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
request this forbearance um or deferral
 
02:13:17.199 --> 02:13:18.310 align:start position:0%
request this forbearance um or deferral
situation

02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
once again so that was slated to end at
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
the end of march they have now
 
02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
um extended it through the end of june
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
um and also allowed people that have
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
already requested
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
forbearance uh to extend their
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
forbearance period
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
um even further so the question here is
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
when folks who are in forbearance reach
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
the end of that
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
allowed period the system is
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
theoretically structured
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
so that people will either begin paying
 
02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:50.310 align:start position:0%
so that people will either begin paying
again

02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
or will go through some kind of a loan
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
modification process that allows them to
 
02:13:56.790 --> 02:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
continue to pay on their loans
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
and get back into a current situation
 
02:14:02.229 --> 02:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
um and if that all works the way it is
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
theoretically supposed to
 
02:14:06.550 --> 02:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
there might be very little impact on our
 
02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:07.270 align:start position:0%
there might be very little impact on our
markets

02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
markets
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
if on the other hand uh what we find at
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
the other end of this is that there's a
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
lot of economically distressed home
 
02:14:13.119 --> 02:14:13.830 align:start position:0%
lot of economically distressed home
buyers

02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
buyers
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
who can't modify their loans and
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
continue to stay in their home
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
then you might see some impact on the
 
02:14:21.199 --> 02:14:22.390 align:start position:0%
then you might see some impact on the
market

02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
market
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
that could include increased foreclosure
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
activity which tends to um impact
 
02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
activity which tends to um impact
consumer

02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
confidence perhaps depressed prices um
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
but at the same time increase inventory
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
for sale which would be
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
something that could help moderate that
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
challenge in our state and
 
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
i really am not in a position we're not
 
02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
really in a position to predict
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
um what the implications of all of this
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be there are some
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
experts who believe that it could be
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
well into 2022
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
before this issue is fully resolved and
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
we really understand what the
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
implications are
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
for the overall market
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
high level of forbearance yes sir
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
the numbers that you use the 11.19
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
for the fha is that percent
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
of total loans yes and then
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
you have any idea what the total loans
 
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.870 align:start position:0%
you have any idea what the total loans
are

02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh the total number of loans this is
 
02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
national data
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
but we can get the committee data on new
 
02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:24.310 align:start position:0%
but we can get the committee data on new
hampshire

02:15:24.310 --> 02:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
um the total number of more i would
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
point out a couple of things this
 
02:15:31.030 --> 02:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
the the federal forbearance rules only
 
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
apply to federally
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh connected loans which amount to about
 
02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:36.790 align:start position:0%
uh connected loans which amount to about
70

02:15:36.790 --> 02:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
70
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
of all mortgages nationally and we think
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
about 65 or 66 percent of all mortgages
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
but we can get you a breakdown on that
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
um i don't have it with me right now but
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
we can get you that and we'll send that
 
02:15:49.679 --> 02:15:50.310 align:start position:0%
we can get you that and we'll send that
along

02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
along
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
to chris for the committee um i would
 
02:15:55.589 --> 02:15:55.599 align:start position:0%
also tell you that we believe based on
 
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
our own
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of our portfolio that the real
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
delinquency rate here
 
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
is about half the number that you're
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
looking at in other words
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
those that are that are true what we
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
would describe as traditionally
 
02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:08.629 align:start position:0%
would describe as traditionally
delinquent

02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
delinquent
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
probably are in the five or six percent
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
range for
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
um for fha loans at this point um and
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
the rest are those people that took
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of this deferral
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity but may not have any
 
02:16:23.109 --> 02:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
significant difficulty
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
as things come out what we're hearing is
 
02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:26.149 align:start position:0%
as things come out what we're hearing is
that

02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
about 25 of everyone who
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
begins the transition out of forbearance
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
has significant challenges um
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
and the other 75 are able to resume
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
payments but um still early to know
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
um exactly what the implications of this
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
are going to be for our overall markets
 
02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:50.990 align:start position:0%
next slide please ben
 
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:53.270 align:start position:0%
next slide please ben
[Music]

02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
going back to the question of why are we
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing such a tight market
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
environment why is there such an
 
02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
inventory shortage
 
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
um we frankly aren't building enough
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
housing this is not a new
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
story we've talked about this i think
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
with the committee in the past i know a
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago i spoke
 
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
with many of you and and really went
 
02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
over some of this data and i remember
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
russ tebow has spoken to the committee
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the past and
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
he did some analysis for us that
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
concluded that you know there's
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere between a 15 and 20
 
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
000 unit shortage in new hampshire
 
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
between what we believe is true demand
 
02:17:31.349 --> 02:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
versus the availability of housing both
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
in the multi and single family side
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
these two lines represent building
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
permits um
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
the black or gray line is single-family
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
housing permits the sort of orangey line
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
is um multi-family permits you can see
 
02:17:46.319 --> 02:17:46.790 align:start position:0%
is um multi-family permits you can see
the

02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
effect of the great procession 2008-9
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
the dramatic drop-off in building
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
activity particularly on the
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
single-family side
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
nowhere near full recovery there we're
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
about half
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
the level of activity not even there
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
that we were before the great recession
 
02:18:02.479 --> 02:18:02.950 align:start position:0%
that we were before the great recession
and

02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
multifamily has seen a little bit of
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
recovery but
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
not um enough frankly to meet what we
 
02:18:09.910 --> 02:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
view as being a
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
current consumer demand so we're simply
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
not producing enough housing
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
to meet a demand and that puts pressure
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
on the markets
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
um the the positive side of that is it
 
02:18:22.309 --> 02:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
means if you're trying to sell a house
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
you can sell it quickly
 
02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
if you're a landlord you can fill your
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
vacancies quickly um
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
it also means that prices are continuing
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
to go up which if again if you're
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
selling a house is a good thing
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's not as good if you're trying to
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
buy one and and
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
from an affordability perspective it
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
creates challenges for people
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
there was a specific question that we
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
were asked to try to address which is
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
whether there
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
is um been any substantive increase in
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
the number of people
 
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
out of state purchasing homes in new
 
02:18:56.240 --> 02:18:56.790 align:start position:0%
out of state purchasing homes in new
hampshire

02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
and we have been looking at that issue
 
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
because we know there's been some
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
speculation in the media about this
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's been some anecdotal
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
conversation about this um so we went
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
back and took a look at this over the
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
last month or two
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
and look back at a data going back as
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
far as 2016.
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
you will note that it was pretty steady
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
um through
 
02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
up until 2020 that about um 75
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
of all of the home purchases in new
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire were by
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
from people who were already here uh
 
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:28.629 align:start position:0%
from people who were already here uh
about

02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
15 were from people from massachusetts
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
which is where most people who migrate
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
into the state from another
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
part of the country come from um and one
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
percent was
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh people from the rest of the country
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
um there was an uptick in 2020 there's
 
02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
no doubt about it
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
um the the number of new hampshire-based
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
buyers dropped to 71
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the number of massachusetts based
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
buyers went up
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
to 18 although the number from the rest
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the country didn't really change much
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh hard to know whether that is a
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
beginning of a significant
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
trend that will impact the markets long
 
02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
trend that will impact the markets long
term

02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
um or whether that was just a sort of a
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
blip that was directly related to the
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic there is
 
02:20:17.349 --> 02:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
a theory um which is you know not
 
02:20:17.359 --> 02:20:18.389 align:start position:0%
a theory um which is you know not
necessarily

02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
derived scientifically but is simply
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
based on anecdotal
 
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
information that some folks from
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts have chosen
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
to purchase homes in new hampshire
 
02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
because of the lower density the less
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
urban environment
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
as a result of their experience during
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
the the pandemic
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
the impact appears to have been more
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
heavily concentrated again based on
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
in the seacoast in the lakes region in
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
the north country
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
and may involve circumstances in which
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
people are acquiring properties that
 
02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be seasonal homes and
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
essentially converting them
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
into permanent residences um hard to
 
02:21:00.399 --> 02:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
into permanent residences um hard to
know

02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
something we will continue to watch and
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
we will continue to report on
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
as things evolve but this is the data
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
at this point there is is a small but
 
02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:11.670 align:start position:0%
at this point there is is a small but
subtle

02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
subtle
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
change in this phenomenon in this
 
02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:17.429 align:start position:0%
change in this phenomenon in this
dynamic

02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
dynamic
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
next slide ben um
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
so trends in terms of sales activity
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
just summarizing very strong demand
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
fueled i think by a combination of low
 
02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:30.389 align:start position:0%
fueled i think by a combination of low
inventory

02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
and low interest rates uh people see an
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to purchase at low rates
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
they see
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
houses limited number of houses for sale
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
and they move quickly to buy them
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that sort of has enhanced the demand
 
02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
in the second half of 2020
 
02:21:49.349 --> 02:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
causing those sort of um normal
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
rates of sales even as we got into the
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
winter months
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
time on market is very short um and
 
02:21:57.030 --> 02:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
prices have been
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
being pressed upward um as a result of
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
these factors
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
um it is in fact as i mentioned earlier
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
really a tale of two years the first
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
part of 2020 was
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
not that strong but the second part was
 
02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
very very strong
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
and as we come into 21 it appears um
 
02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
just anecdotally that those trends have
 
02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:17.990 align:start position:0%
just anecdotally that those trends have
continued

02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
continued
 
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
but it's hard to know whether they will
 
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
continue as we come out of the pandemic
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
um next slide ben
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
the other specific question chris asked
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
us to uh look at
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
was the types of mortgages that uh
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
people were using to the extent that we
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
were able to
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
um to glean that information and we
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
we had to use data from the mortgage
 
02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
bankers association the national
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
mortgage bankers association
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
but this is foreign new hampshire so um
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
the um first of all the very low
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
interest rates means that the vast
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
majority of mortgage activity in the
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
state now
 
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
is for refinancing uh rather than for
 
02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:01.270 align:start position:0%
is for refinancing uh rather than for
purchase

02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
and it's 80 of all loan applications
 
02:23:04.399 --> 02:23:04.790 align:start position:0%
and it's 80 of all loan applications
were

02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
refi um and but there still
 
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
reflects a the data still reflects a
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
significant increase in activity
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
both purchase and refinance relative to
 
02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:16.309 align:start position:0%
both purchase and refinance relative to
2019

02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
2019
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
you can see those numbers there they're
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
quite significant um
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the um we did
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
look at investor um purchase mortgages
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
that is people buying homes
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
for um rental or to to
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
future resale um new hampshire's numbers
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
are slightly higher than the national
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
average there
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh to be honest we don't have good
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
historic data there to know whether
 
02:23:41.670 --> 02:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
new thing or whether that's always been
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
the case we do know on the second home
 
02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:47.030 align:start position:0%
the case we do know on the second home
side

02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire has tended to have a
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
slightly higher level
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
of second home um purchases than
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
of the national data and that simply
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
reflects a lot of the destinations we
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
have that are
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
sort of seasonal vacation related areas
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
again the seacoast lakes region
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
the north country and that's not a new
 
02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:07.110 align:start position:0%
the north country and that's not a new
phenomenon

02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
phenomenon
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
um in terms of um the types of mortgage
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
structures that people are choosing
 
02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
most people are choosing fixed rate
 
02:24:16.319 --> 02:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
most people are choosing fixed rate
mortgages

02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
mortgages
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
um and that makes complete sense if you
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
can get a mortgage in the three percent
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
or lower rate you would presumably want
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
to lock that in
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
for the longer term about 92 percent of
 
02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
purchase mortgages are still 30-year
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
fixed rate
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
um more refined mortgages are
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
very excuse me are for shorter terms 15
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
again that makes sense people look at
 
02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
the refinancing not only to save money
 
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
but to perhaps shorten the term of their
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
mortgage and the amount of interest
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
what is clear here is that adjustable
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
rate mortgages
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
are not particularly popular in this
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
current interest rate environment which
 
02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
current interest rate environment which
again

02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:08.230 --> 02:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of other trends that we would
 
02:25:11.270 --> 02:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
just note for
 
02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:14.290 align:start position:0%
the committee the
 
02:25:14.290 --> 02:25:16.070 align:start position:0%
the committee the
[Music]

02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
level of population growth in new
 
02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
level of population growth in new
hampshire

02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
while not as large as we have
 
02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
while not as large as we have
experienced

02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
in previous decades is still higher than
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in the rest of the
 
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
northeast and i think it reflects
 
02:25:32.309 --> 02:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
movement again primarily from
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts um
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
and and probably reflects interest in
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
really the lifestyle
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
um other factors that are positive while
 
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining the proximity to
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
the boston metro area um and
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
so we are seeing a phenomenon where
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
there is some
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
in migration from other states
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
particularly from massachusetts
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
um which is not kind of common to the
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the northeast
 
02:26:00.389 --> 02:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
where what population growth is seen
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
there is largely
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
from real immigration if you will
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
outside of the
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
country um there is also some sense that
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
there might be some population impact
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
from people who have traditionally been
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
seasonal residents that is they already
 
02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:15.910 align:start position:0%
seasonal residents that is they already
own

02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
um a property in new hampshire that was
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
a seasonal property
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
but they're choosing to move here and
 
02:26:22.469 --> 02:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
use that as their permanent
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
or primary residence and again part of
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
that may simply reflect
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
um people's retirement planning and
 
02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
that's always
 
02:26:32.469 --> 02:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
been true part of it may reflect the
 
02:26:32.479 --> 02:26:33.670 align:start position:0%
been true part of it may reflect the
pandemic

02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
because again there's some evidence
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
nationally that people are choosing to
 
02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:37.830 align:start position:0%
nationally that people are choosing to
move

02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
move
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
away from urban environments um into
 
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
less urban environments
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
if they can do so and there are some
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
implications obviously
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
um in for local population levels and
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps demand for services from this
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
although as we point out there could be
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
an impact on
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
on education costs a lot of the folks
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
who are likely
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
moving here um do not have
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
very large households even in the 25 to
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
40 year range
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
national data shows that household sizes
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
have shrunk significantly
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
and i think there may be one or two more
 
02:27:14.399 --> 02:27:16.230 align:start position:0%
and i think there may be one or two more
slides

02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
slides
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
and then i'll i will take whatever
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
questions i can um
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
so just in conclusion right now there's
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
very high demand
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
sales activity remains brisk we believe
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
that will continue
 
02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
at least in the near term um that will
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
probably mean that
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
prices will continue to be forced upward
 
02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:36.469 align:start position:0%
prices will continue to be forced upward
um

02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
the core issues here again are the
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
unknowns associated with
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
foreclosure uh could that increase as a
 
02:27:44.309 --> 02:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
result of
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
economic distress and we won't know that
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
until the whole forbearance
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
issue unwinds and that could take um
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
at least a year quite frankly um and and
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
the constrained supply
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
remains a significant concern in new
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire both
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
for sale and for rental housing and the
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
very last slide just points out that
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
um that there are implications
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
from that for economic growth um in the
 
02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:11.270 align:start position:0%
from that for economic growth um in the
future

02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh for the state we've talked about this
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the past um
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
if businesses can't recruit and retain
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
people because they don't have a place
 
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
to live
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's a real challenge even in this
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
environment where remote
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
working has has increased dramatically a
 
02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
02:28:29.429 --> 02:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
the kind of job growth that we want to
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
encourage is in places like
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
people need to physically be here in
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
most cases for that to work
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
um and that means they need to have a
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
place to live somewhere
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
um near their their job there is an
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
affordability challenge here which we
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
always point out it's our job
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and and some threat to housing
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
stability particularly for lower income
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
people because
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
of that very limited supply and the
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
upward pressure on prices
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll stop talking at you
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
and try to answer your questions and if
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
um you'd like us to go back to a slide
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
just tell us and
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
i have no idea how to do that but i'm
 
02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
sure that ben will be able to figure it
 
02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:10.230 align:start position:0%
sure that ben will be able to figure it
out

02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you dean and welcome sir
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you for your
 
02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
presentation very good
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh i do want you to go back to your side
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh slide six
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
there it is yes i just want to clarify
 
02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure the uh
 
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh did the orange line that's the
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
12 month moving average is that it
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay the average of the last 12
 
02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:00.870 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay the average of the last 12
months

02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
after it's recalculated correct yes sir
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah just to show a trend line because
 
02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
yeah just to show a trend line because
the

02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:08.469 --> 02:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
there's so much volatility in the month
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
to month
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
numbers traditionally in fact if you
 
02:30:12.309 --> 02:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
look at it going
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's not so much now obviously but if
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
you go back
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
there used to be these sort of low
 
02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
points in the winter time
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
when there was less demand and prices
 
02:30:24.309 --> 02:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
tended to bottom out so we've always
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
tried to show the
 
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
12-month moving average to really give
 
02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
people a sense of what
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
price trends are like right now i
 
02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the moving average actually
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
so i just have a comment i don't want to
 
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
make sure my wife and i were coming back
 
02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:37.429 align:start position:0%
make sure my wife and i were coming back
from

02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
breakfast the other day and i said you
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
know there was a new development in
 
02:30:41.429 --> 02:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
august that was they were just putting a
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
road in in my town
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
and this was the end of august 18 plots
 
02:30:50.230 --> 02:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh they are all of them are sold but
 
02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:51.670 align:start position:0%
uh they are all of them are sold but
three

02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
and most of them are already up in the
 
02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
span of like five months
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable and they're all
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
gigantic houses because we have a two
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
two acre zoning so the builders are
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
going to want to build something big on
 
02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:04.150 align:start position:0%
going to want to build something big on
those

02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:31:06.630 --> 02:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
so it's just amazing i was just shocked
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
at how quickly they got these homes up
 
02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
i just i think yes sir i think that
 
02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:13.349 align:start position:0%
i just i think yes sir i think that
anecdotally

02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
anecdotally
 
02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
both builders and realtors will tell you
 
02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:16.550 align:start position:0%
both builders and realtors will tell you
that

02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:18.389 --> 02:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
particularly new construction there is
 
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
enormous demand for it and if
 
02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
anything that is built will sell very
 
02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:23.429 align:start position:0%
anything that is built will sell very
quickly

02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
and to go to your point about larger
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
more expensive homes
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
through a combination of factors the
 
02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
cost of labor the availability of labor
 
02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
the custom materials
 
02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
and frankly regulatory policies as you
 
02:31:37.030 --> 02:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out the two-acre minimum
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh issue you know it pushes
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
the market in the direction of higher
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
cost housing when there is an
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity for new construction
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
can i have one uh follow-up question uh
 
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
yeah uh back to your uh the first or
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
your second slide or third slide i guess
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
was on the uh
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
reynolds you mentioned some southern
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
markets there were some
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
is that more in the salem area
 
02:32:02.080 --> 02:32:03.349 align:start position:0%
is that more in the salem area
londonderry

02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
londonderry
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
that region where that would it's
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
basically a
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
southern rockingham and hillsborough
 
02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
counties is where we've seen
 
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
the increased activity londonderry is a
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
particular example
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
frankly of where there's been a lot of
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
multi-family development
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
also to a degree merrimack to a degree
 
02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:22.630 align:start position:0%
also to a degree merrimack to a degree
bedford

02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
bedford
 
02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm counting really kind of
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
manchester south
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
if you will in that that sort of broad
 
02:32:29.439 --> 02:32:30.309 align:start position:0%
if you will in that that sort of broad
stroke

02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
stroke
 
02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
well do you are you familiar with
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
rockingham park's uh
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
development there i know a lot of those
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
are condominiums but are some of those
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
rentals as well
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
it i am not um i'm not
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
super familiar with it but my
 
02:32:45.590 --> 02:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
there is mostly condominium there may be
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
some rental housing in there but i
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's fairly high
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
and housing yep okay
 
02:32:57.670 --> 02:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome before we go to
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
the new
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
questions on the current listing slide
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
on each line like the bottom line the
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
orange line
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
does that represent sales under 3 100
 
02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:16.469 align:start position:0%
does that represent sales under 3 100
000

02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir yeah i'm sorry i realized that
 
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
we should have put
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
little notes on what this meant or a key
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh the black line is total listings
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
of the the blue line is listings under
 
02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:30.790 align:start position:0%
of the the blue line is listings under
300

02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
300
 
02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
000 and the orange line is listings
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
over three hundred thousand dollars
 
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative army
 
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't know why
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
the top thing at least on mine
 
02:33:58.150 --> 02:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
is is turning between various people
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
really quickly and being very
 
02:33:59.439 --> 02:34:00.230 align:start position:0%
really quickly and being very
distracting

02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
distracting
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
it stopped it now that i'm there but
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
i had several questions about housing
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
permits lagging
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
and where are the buyers coming from
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
which is kind of late
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the slideshow they've dropped
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
age numbers at that point
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah and um the first one
 
02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
is there doesn't seem to be
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
any real increase in construction going
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
on in 2020
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
and i think that's probably due
 
02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
to to the regulatory
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
part that you were talking about plus in
 
02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:42.469 align:start position:0%
part that you were talking about plus in
my

02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
area in lebanon we have almost a
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
thousand units
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
of apartments which have been uh
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
permitted or almost completely permitted
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
and two one of them permitted in one of
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
them almost
 
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
are which are i think 800 units between
 
02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:02.150 align:start position:0%
are which are i think 800 units between
them

02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh have been um on they've got lawsuits
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
against them
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
so that's going to take a while i don't
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
know if they can go to the housing court
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
um but then eventually
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
these almost certainly are going to be
 
02:35:20.479 --> 02:35:21.429 align:start position:0%
these almost certainly are going to be
built

02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
built
 
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
um and they're feeding
 
02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
and my other question about that graph
 
02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
was whether the
 
02:35:38.550 --> 02:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
why it is that multi-family housing
 
02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:39.190 align:start position:0%
why it is that multi-family housing
still

02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
isn't being built very much is it does
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
it cost
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
i think it is primarily
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
a regulatory issue in that in order
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
and although it does connect to your
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
question representative about cost
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
in order to build multi-family housing
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
efficiently you need scale and in order
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
to get
 
02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
to scale you need a regulatory
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
environment that
 
02:36:12.389 --> 02:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
is supportive of that scale and that's
 
02:36:12.399 --> 02:36:13.750 align:start position:0%
is supportive of that scale and that's
really

02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
present only in sort of limited places
 
02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:17.830 align:start position:0%
present only in sort of limited places
so

02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:19.830 --> 02:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
there are parts of the seacoast again
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
the southern tier
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
that we discussed earlier certain
 
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
specific communities that have made a
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
really concerted effort to try to
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
provide opportunities for that type of
 
02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
housing development
 
02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's where you're seeing it in other
 
02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
parts of the state
 
02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
it is not as easy to do it's also true
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
quite frankly and
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be i think respectful of folks that
 
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
in certain market areas you can't be
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
sure that you'd be able to get the
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
market to build at the scale that would
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
allow you to
 
02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
um do it efficiently um the one that you
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned the upper valley is one where
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of demand
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
and you can get to scale um it's but
 
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's kind of unique
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and if i could
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:37:40.469 --> 02:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
i think the metaphor of the
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh k-shaped recovery is extremely
 
02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:44.230 align:start position:0%
uh k-shaped recovery is extremely
interesting

02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:37:47.910 --> 02:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh the diverging where have seem to get
 
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
stronger and have nots weaker
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
and we tend to think of those in
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
aggregated demographic
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
terms but i wonder how much you've
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
disaggregated the data here
 
02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
down into at least counties if not even
 
02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:06.710 align:start position:0%
down into at least counties if not even
communities

02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:08.469 --> 02:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
even in the upper valley as was just
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned by
 
02:38:12.389 --> 02:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
representative army where there's demand
 
02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
in lebanon
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
30 minutes south in charlestown i can
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
point to one subdivision of 24 lots
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
i think very fairly priced that
 
02:38:27.429 --> 02:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
was divided about a dozen years ago
 
02:38:31.110 --> 02:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
and in a dozen years three lots of sold
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
so we have a very very different picture
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think in sullivan county than in the
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
rest of the state
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
and in my town uh even
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
relative to sullivan county most
 
02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
information that we ever see is
 
02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:46.950 align:start position:0%
information that we ever see is
aggregated

02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
aggregated
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
at federal and state level and it
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us the insights
 
02:38:53.910 --> 02:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
into the way geography is part of the
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree with any of that i do
 
02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
believe you're absolutely right and we
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
should we tend to show data a
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
statewide or a really broad region and
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
it has a certain story you are correct
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
that there are certain markets
 
02:39:14.710 --> 02:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
that do not reflect uh perhaps
 
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
some of the characteristics here um
 
02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
and um those markets
 
02:39:24.309 --> 02:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
may have slightly higher um
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
of inventory for instance of for sale
 
02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:28.150 align:start position:0%
of inventory for instance of for sale
homes

02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
it may take longer to sell a home in
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
those markets
 
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
and their price appreciation may not be
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
quite as dramatic we do
 
02:39:38.230 --> 02:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
try to do that when we can one of the
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
challenges we run into sometimes
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
is statistical significance when there's
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
a small
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
volume of data that we can work with
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
i would point out that we do publish
 
02:39:51.270 --> 02:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates
 
02:39:54.630 --> 02:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
and rent levels by county and
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
the data there from last year anyway and
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
we'll be redoing that that analysis in
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
the next few months
 
02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
did not show significant difference
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
across the state i mean the rent levels
 
02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
might be lower
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
in some markets but there were not
 
02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
in some markets but there were not
dramatic

02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
dramatic
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
changes in vacancies when we actually
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
looked at those at least on the rental
 
02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:15.750 align:start position:0%
looked at those at least on the rental
side

02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the market but i agree with you that
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
there is there are market areas that do
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
not reflect
 
02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
these specific factors as strongly as
 
02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:26.550 align:start position:0%
these specific factors as strongly as
others

02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
others
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely right very quick follow is if
 
02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:30.070 align:start position:0%
absolutely right very quick follow is if
you

02:40:30.070 --> 02:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
have any information uh
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
that would allow you to give us the same
 
02:40:37.590 --> 02:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
information that you have in these
 
02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
slides on a county basis i think that
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
would be very revealing
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
we will do the best we can with that
 
02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:43.830 align:start position:0%
we will do the best we can with that
yeah

02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative i can follow up with you
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
directly with
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
the some of the data that we're able to
 
02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:50.950 align:start position:0%
the some of the data that we're able to
disaggregate

02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
disaggregate
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
on say a county basis uh or in some
 
02:40:56.469 --> 02:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
cases smaller geographies but as as dean
 
02:40:58.309 --> 02:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
02:41:01.349 --> 02:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
where we're dealing with data on a at a
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
town level
 
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
we start to witness um significant
 
02:41:07.349 --> 02:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
margins of error
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
unless we're looking at absolute numbers
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
as we do with
 
02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
the building permit data for example
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
understood thank you welcome mary
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
hack and phillips thank you mr chair
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
as a side note before i direct my
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
question to the housing finance
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
authority mr chair i thought it might be
 
02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:27.110 align:start position:0%
authority mr chair i thought it might be
helpful

02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
um i mean this picture of the
 
02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
residential market has been really
 
02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
eye-opening and i think it will be
 
02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
helpful for us but i'm wondering if it's
 
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
possible to get
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
some sort of commercial data at all for
 
02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not sure who we would direct
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
that request to but i just thought maybe
 
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:41:47.269 --> 02:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
chris okay
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
let's talk about how we can get that
 
02:41:57.760 --> 02:41:59.030 align:start position:0%
let's talk about how we can get that
information

02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
yep okay thank you
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and then my question to you um
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
well to the housing finance authority um
 
02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's just a follow-up on your
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
quick discussion about those mortgage
 
02:42:13.510 --> 02:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
delinquencies and
 
02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know the unknown kind of situation
 
02:42:18.550 --> 02:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
related to those mortgage payment
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
deferrals and forbearance
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
um forbearances that are being taken
 
02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
care of by
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
elect i should say elected by certain
 
02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:28.469 align:start position:0%
elect i should say elected by certain
homeowners

02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
if this uh situation is kind of going to
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
unfold into 2022-ish
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
time zone um is it is it your
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
understanding as well that there is
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a backup in terms of
 
02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
foreclosures and bankruptcies that
 
02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
homeowners are pursuing
 
02:42:49.349 --> 02:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
in you know the current market and do
 
02:42:51.269 --> 02:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
you anticipate a similar
 
02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
um kind of pent-up demand for those as
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
i cannot speak with any definitive sense
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
because i
 
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
as i said i think there's a lot of
 
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
unknowns about how this process is going
 
02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:06.830 align:start position:0%
unknowns about how this process is going
to

02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
unfold um there have been
 
02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
very little on the way of foreclosures
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
as you know because of either moratoria
 
02:43:15.110 --> 02:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
or because
 
02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
of this forbearance structure um
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
for almost a year now and um
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
30 of all the mortgages in the state are
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
not covered by the federal rules
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
um you know the they are mostly in the
 
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
hands of
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
community banks and credit unions who
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
have portfolioed them and my
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is that most of them have
 
02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:38.070 align:start position:0%
understanding is that most of them have
been

02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
providing essentially the same kind of
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
protections to their borrowers that the
 
02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
has been providing whether they can and
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
will continue to do that indefinitely
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
is is a good question um i
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
would suspect that there will be some
 
02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
increase in foreclosure activity
 
02:43:59.590 --> 02:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
eventually as this shakes out simply
 
02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
because it seems unlikely that
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
all or you know the vast majority of
 
02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:05.269 align:start position:0%
all or you know the vast majority of
people

02:44:05.269 --> 02:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
will be able to adjust their mortgages
 
02:44:09.990 --> 02:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
if they really had any kind of
 
02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
significant economic impact
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
but it isn't unknown and i don't want to
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
mislead the committee by saying i know
 
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
that that's going to happen
 
02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
i would imagine the bankruptcies will
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
also go up if that happens because
 
02:44:23.349 --> 02:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's one of the tools that people use
 
02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
as you know to um to
 
02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know react to a potential
 
02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:30.309 align:start position:0%
you know react to a potential
foreclosure

02:44:30.309 --> 02:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
foreclosure
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
if if the system works the way everybody
 
02:44:34.389 --> 02:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
hopes it works
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
then people will go through a loan
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
modification process
 
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
um the again that low interest rate
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
environment helps
 
02:44:44.469 --> 02:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
because it means that you can take a
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
loan that was written at say six percent
 
02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
and you can restructure it to say three
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
percent um and maybe save people quite a
 
02:44:54.469 --> 02:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
bit of money and adjust for a drop in
 
02:44:54.479 --> 02:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
bit of money and adjust for a drop in
their

02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:44:57.269 --> 02:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
economic circumstance and keep them in
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
their home and i think that's the goal
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the federal government in all of
 
02:45:02.550 --> 02:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
these programs and i suspect it's the
 
02:45:04.150 --> 02:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
goal of most lenders
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh but we really don't know until this
 
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
all kind of
 
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh comes through and
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
the continued um pushing forward
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
of forbearance just kind of keeps
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
pushing forward the
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
answer to your question to be honest i'm
 
02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:21.349 align:start position:0%
answer to your question to be honest i'm
and

02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i i wish i had a better answer for
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
you than that this is a
 
02:45:27.030 --> 02:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
just a high level of uncertainty that
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
all of us in the industry are
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
just living with right now um and if i
 
02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
may i'll just speak to your earlier
 
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
question i can't answer your your
 
02:45:36.309 --> 02:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
question about commercial
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
data but one of the things we have
 
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
decided that we're going to do in
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
partnership with the community
 
02:45:43.590 --> 02:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
development finance authority is
 
02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:44.230 align:start position:0%
development finance authority is
commission

02:45:44.230 --> 02:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:45:47.349 --> 02:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
um a study of the
 
02:45:50.469 --> 02:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
vacant commercial properties that might
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
have the
 
02:45:53.429 --> 02:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
um opportunity to be converted into
 
02:45:53.439 --> 02:45:54.550 align:start position:0%
um opportunity to be converted into
housing

02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
as a way of of sort of addressing that
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
that inventory issue that we talked
 
02:45:59.910 --> 02:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
about earlier
 
02:46:01.349 --> 02:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
and that's something we hope to have by
 
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:09.269 --> 02:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
my question is is there any historical
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
data that you might be able to share
 
02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
with us about um foreclosures and
 
02:46:14.479 --> 02:46:15.590 align:start position:0%
with us about um foreclosures and
bankruptcies

02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
bankruptcies
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
or you know lobbying that into the
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
foreclosure um just so we could kind of
 
02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:20.630 align:start position:0%
foreclosure um just so we could kind of
see

02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
possibly what the trend was for the last
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
few years and if there is
 
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know foreseeable bottleneck um or
 
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
dropbox yeah
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we have we have very good data
 
02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
on foreclosures going back over a decade
 
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
um that we can share with you and i can
 
02:46:36.550 --> 02:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
tell you that the trend was
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
a very very much downward over the last
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
few years
 
02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
we were projecting a very limited number
 
02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
of foreclosures for 2020 originally
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic hit and
 
02:46:49.110 --> 02:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
obviously there were very few but that
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
was an artificial
 
02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
dynamic and we don't really know where
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
it would have ended up
 
02:46:55.110 --> 02:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
we will look at the bankruptcy
 
02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
information i don't know
 
02:46:58.309 --> 02:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
whether we have access to that but if we
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
can get it we'll get it to you
 
02:47:03.190 --> 02:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tucker
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh first if i may
 
02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:15.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh first if i may
just

02:47:15.030 --> 02:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:47:17.269 --> 02:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
um answer representative obrami's
 
02:47:17.279 --> 02:47:18.309 align:start position:0%
um answer representative obrami's
question

02:47:18.309 --> 02:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:47:22.150 --> 02:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
about um rockingham park
 
02:47:24.389 --> 02:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
in salem being from salem i am familiar
 
02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh several rental units being built
 
02:47:31.349 --> 02:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
um as well as as housing the rental
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
units are quite expensive
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
they seem to be way above the chart that
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
the average that we saw in the chart
 
02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
here which i believe was fourteen
 
02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
hundred and something for
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
two bedrooms i believe two bedrooms are
 
02:47:44.389 --> 02:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
more closer to the three thousand dollar
 
02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
range there
 
02:47:51.750 --> 02:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
obviously there's several factors that
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
are leading to a tight housing market
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
and low inventory
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
low interest rates and so forth that
 
02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned um
 
02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
how do we have a sense for how big a
 
02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:04.389 align:start position:0%
how do we have a sense for how big a
factor

02:48:04.389 --> 02:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
factor
 
02:48:07.990 --> 02:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
covet is in the sense that um
 
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
many people are reluctant to list their
 
02:48:11.190 --> 02:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
houses because
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
with covert they don't want to go around
 
02:48:14.710 --> 02:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
and look at houses
 
02:48:16.950 --> 02:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
look at other houses or they're not sure
 
02:48:18.550 --> 02:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
if if covid gets to a point where people
 
02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:22.309 align:start position:0%
if if covid gets to a point where people
aren't

02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
02:48:24.630 --> 02:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh people are much more confident that
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's under control and
 
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
and you know people are vaccinated
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
whatever do we anticipate that that's
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
a fairly big factor in in
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
increasing inventory i think it's a very
 
02:48:37.510 --> 02:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
good question
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
and one that i wish i had a really good
 
02:48:41.590 --> 02:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
answer to i think anecdotally
 
02:48:43.590 --> 02:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
people do believe that is people in the
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
industry do believe there are there is
 
02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:47.190 align:start position:0%
industry do believe there are there is
uh

02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
inventory there that would um come on
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
the market
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
if people were more comfortable um in
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
this environment with people coming into
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
their homes
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
the the one factor that i i guess i
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
would reinforce
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
is that there's not a lot of new
 
02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:02.870 align:start position:0%
is that there's not a lot of new
production

02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
production
 
02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
and so um we're still going to have
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
potentially a shortage
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
it might mitigate a little bit the the
 
02:49:11.269 --> 02:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
very tight inventory situation that
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're currently
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
experiencing and you might see a little
 
02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
more um a product available if
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
if we get through the pandemic um and
 
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
people have a higher level of comfort
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
going forward you're probably right
 
02:49:25.990 --> 02:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's just it's very difficult to gauge
 
02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
um in this environment there are those
 
02:49:31.349 --> 02:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
frankly who
 
02:49:33.910 --> 02:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
um would have predicted six or seven
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
months ago that there would have been
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
very little sales activity in the second
 
02:49:39.670 --> 02:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
half of 2020 for exactly the reason
 
02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:40.469 align:start position:0%
half of 2020 for exactly the reason
you're

02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:49:43.110 --> 02:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
discussing yet as you know from the data
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
more than anybody anticipated um so it's
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes hard to predict consumer
 
02:49:50.230 --> 02:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
behavior to be
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
honest with you um but likely is not it
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
will go up
 
02:49:56.469 --> 02:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
when people are more comfortable and
 
02:49:57.429 --> 02:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
just to be
 
02:49:59.910 --> 02:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
clear on the rent number the number that
 
02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
we show is
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
is a median so 50 of everything is above
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
and 50
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
below theoretically um so you're
 
02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely right there's a lot of
 
02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
much higher priced rental housing in the
 
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
market than
 
02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
that chart would indicate i brought the
 
02:50:16.230 --> 02:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
slide back
 
02:50:20.230 --> 02:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
up because as dean indicated before
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
the second half of the year in 2020 uh
 
02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
it completely overcame the shortfall in
 
02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
sales in the first half of the year
 
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that this demonstrates um
 
02:50:34.150 --> 02:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
the adjustment that realtors in
 
02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
particular have made
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
in marketing homes so we have a lot more
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
virtual marketing if you will
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
where potential buyers don't have to
 
02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
enter the home
 
02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
maybe only when uh they're ready to
 
02:50:50.309 --> 02:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
um you know make an offer uh would they
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
be interested
 
02:50:53.590 --> 02:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
and um you know they've developed other
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
means of showing homes as well
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
and you know i think open houses while
 
02:50:57.920 --> 02:50:58.550 align:start position:0%
and you know i think open houses while
the

02:50:58.550 --> 02:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
occupants are away also helps to allay
 
02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
some of people's concerns about covet
 
02:51:06.790 --> 02:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
so that the numbers of sales that we've
 
02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:07.830 align:start position:0%
so that the numbers of sales that we've
seen

02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
seen
 
02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
in is particularly in november december
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
and going into january
 
02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
are uh in stark contrast to typical
 
02:51:16.870 --> 02:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
winter trends
 
02:51:20.550 --> 02:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
the pace of sales remains very strong
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i would just reinforce quickly
 
02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
ben's point there i think the industry
 
02:51:26.230 --> 02:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
like a lot of other industries um
 
02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:27.030 align:start position:0%
like a lot of other industries um
reacted

02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
reacted
 
02:51:30.389 --> 02:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
and and evolved very quickly and came up
 
02:51:32.630 --> 02:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
with protocols designed to
 
02:51:34.230 --> 02:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully mitigate a lot of people's
 
02:51:36.150 --> 02:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
concerns about things and
 
02:51:39.429 --> 02:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
and they've managed to support a really
 
02:51:40.950 --> 02:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
astounding level of sales
 
02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
during this very difficult period
 
02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um ribs and ramy
 
02:51:54.389 --> 02:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
triggered something in my memory here
 
02:51:55.910 --> 02:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
from a couple of months ago
 
02:51:58.870 --> 02:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
hearing about dartmouth hitchcock uh
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
going to build some workforce housing on
 
02:52:02.230 --> 02:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
their campus
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
um uh i'd like to represent all me to
 
02:52:07.990 --> 02:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
weigh in a minute about that as well but
 
02:52:10.870 --> 02:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
i thought that's still going on but are
 
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
there other businesses that you know of
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
are moving in this direction to build
 
02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
some workforce housing on their
 
02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
on their land many companies own a lot
 
02:52:21.030 --> 02:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
of land that they can build something
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
like this without having to incur
 
02:52:25.590 --> 02:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of the land uh that they
 
02:52:26.830 --> 02:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
already own
 
02:52:30.150 --> 02:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
um can you just weigh in on that yeah
 
02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question it's one
 
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we um engage
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh folks about uh fairly regularly
 
02:52:38.389 --> 02:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
i think the direct answer to the
 
02:52:40.469 --> 02:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
question i am not aware
 
02:52:44.070 --> 02:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
of any significant number of cases where
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
companies are actually doing that
 
02:52:48.309 --> 02:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock
 
02:52:52.070 --> 02:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
is um probably a leader in that context
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
um but again to be honest with you i can
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
recall having conversations with people
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
there about this idea um almost three
 
02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
years ago and it
 
02:53:02.469 --> 02:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
took them a while to sort of get to the
 
02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
point where they were comfortable with a
 
02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:04.950 align:start position:0%
point where they were comfortable with a
role

02:53:04.950 --> 02:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
role
 
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
um it is you really are asking um
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know businesses to fundamentally
 
02:53:12.309 --> 02:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
rethink what their role is
 
02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
relative to the housing of their
 
02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:15.510 align:start position:0%
relative to the housing of their
employees

02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
and it takes folks a while to kind of
 
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
move in that direction
 
02:53:23.750 --> 02:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and um it tends to first be of
 
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
interest and this is a national
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
um trend um for what i would describe as
 
02:53:30.070 --> 02:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:53:32.950 --> 02:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
place fixed employers employers that
 
02:53:32.960 --> 02:53:33.349 align:start position:0%
place fixed employers employers that
really

02:53:33.349 --> 02:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know are institutions like a health
 
02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
care facility or an educational facility
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really have a choice but to
 
02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:42.870 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really have a choice but to
um

02:53:42.870 --> 02:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
have to stay in one location and they
 
02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:46.469 align:start position:0%
have to stay in one location and they
can't

02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
expand somewhere else um in another
 
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
state or another you know
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
market area in an easy way we've seen
 
02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
some evidence of healthcare institutions
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
02:53:59.429 --> 02:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
being leaders in this role and we're
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually part of a group
 
02:54:02.870 --> 02:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
working with some other partners to look
 
02:54:05.349 --> 02:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
at how we could encourage healthcare
 
02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
institutions to um to do more of that
 
02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
um but obviously they're a little
 
02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
distracted right now by other
 
02:54:13.510 --> 02:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
factors and perhaps this is not their
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
highest priority in other cases
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
to follow up mr chair yeah just just a
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
comment again
 
02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh when you were mentioning uh
 
02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
repurposing uh commercial properties
 
02:54:26.070 --> 02:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe if representative molloy is on
 
02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
this on the zoom i can't see his name
 
02:54:28.630 --> 02:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
here but
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
he can weigh in i remember hearing a
 
02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
couple people called me and i never
 
02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:32.870 align:start position:0%
couple people called me and i never
verified

02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
verified
 
02:54:34.870 --> 02:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
that our small mall that we have in
 
02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:36.230 align:start position:0%
that our small mall that we have in
newington

02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
newington
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be closing and going to
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
become uh
 
02:54:40.389 --> 02:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
resident they're going to make they're
 
02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
going to convert it into residential
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh apartments uh so i don't know if
 
02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
you folks have heard anything about that
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
but maybe representative
 
02:54:51.269 --> 02:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
who lives in the same neighborhood i do
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh one town apart we're
 
02:54:55.510 --> 02:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're kind of the suburbs of uh of
 
02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:56.710 align:start position:0%
we're kind of the suburbs of uh of
portsmouth

02:54:56.710 --> 02:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
02:54:58.790 --> 02:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
um whether that is actually going to
 
02:54:58.800 --> 02:54:59.830 align:start position:0%
um whether that is actually going to
happen

02:54:59.830 --> 02:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
and i know you are aware of some of this
 
02:55:02.479 --> 02:55:02.950 align:start position:0%
and i know you are aware of some of this
yes

02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:55:04.630 --> 02:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
so we're we're aware that the the
 
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
newington planning board
 
02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh commissioned a study by planning
 
02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:09.110 align:start position:0%
uh commissioned a study by planning
consultants

02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
consultants
 
02:55:12.309 --> 02:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
um to look at alternative uses of the
 
02:55:12.319 --> 02:55:12.950 align:start position:0%
um to look at alternative uses of the
property

02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and not that not that the planning
 
02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
board controls the use of the property
 
02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:17.429 align:start position:0%
board controls the use of the property
but

02:55:17.429 --> 02:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
they do have a direct impact on the
 
02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:20.790 align:start position:0%
they do have a direct impact on the
zoning

02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the the newington
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
planning board is
 
02:55:26.309 --> 02:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
looking at potential zoning changes to
 
02:55:26.319 --> 02:55:27.990 align:start position:0%
looking at potential zoning changes to
accommodate

02:55:27.990 --> 02:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
02:55:29.670 --> 02:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
a wider variety of uses that would
 
02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
include some residential uses for that
 
02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:33.670 align:start position:0%
include some residential uses for that
property

02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i can understand the difficulty

i'm sure they're going through the uh
 
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
thought process of uh what does more

thank you
 
02:55:58.630 --> 02:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
just to expand upon one thing that the
 
02:55:59.830 --> 02:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
dean was
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
talking about in response uh
 
02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:03.190 align:start position:0%
talking about in response uh

representative
 
02:56:06.550 --> 02:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
rami uh we are familiar with a
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh the owners of a long-term care
 
02:56:09.359 --> 02:56:09.990 align:start position:0%
uh the owners of a long-term care
facility

02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
in durham harmony homes which is in the
 
02:56:14.950 --> 02:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
process of building
 
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
their their own general contractor
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
building a i think a 40 plus unit
 
02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:20.309 align:start position:0%
building a i think a 40 plus unit
development

02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
development
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
in dover and this is a kind of a cottage
 
02:56:25.590 --> 02:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
style development small homes on the
 
02:56:27.030 --> 02:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
order of four to five hundred square
 
02:56:28.150 --> 02:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
feet each
 
02:56:31.349 --> 02:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh that would be for the employees
 
02:56:34.230 --> 02:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
of uh the long-term care facility so
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
they would
 
02:56:37.269 --> 02:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
occupy these units and it would be
 
02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
dedicated for their uses this is going
 
02:56:39.990 --> 02:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
through the permitting
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
process right now uh in in the city of

02:56:45.190 --> 02:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that reminding me
 
02:56:47.429 --> 02:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
of that that is um
 
02:56:48.870 --> 02:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
another example though what i was
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
speaking to earlier which is a place
 
02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:51.110 align:start position:0%
speaking to earlier which is a place
based

02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
based
 
02:56:53.349 --> 02:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
business if you will they they really
 
02:56:54.550 --> 02:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know they they're in
 
02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
a particular market they really don't
 
02:56:58.710 --> 02:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
have a choice but to have employees
 
02:57:01.349 --> 02:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
in that market and they therefore they
 
02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
have taken that major step to actually
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
move into the role of being a housing
 
02:57:05.279 --> 02:57:06.389 align:start position:0%
move into the role of being a housing
developer

02:57:06.389 --> 02:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
developer
 
02:57:10.230 --> 02:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
in order to address the need thank you
 
02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
on i'd like to start by saying something
 
02:57:17.590 --> 02:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
more about
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
on dartmouth college and dartmouth
 
02:57:23.429 --> 02:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
hitchcock dartmouth college has been
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the business of creating housing for
 
02:57:27.510 --> 02:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
its employees
 
02:57:30.070 --> 02:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
since at least the 1960s which is when
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
my parents moved in
 
02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
and we um from the
 
02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
the upper valley housing coalition that
 
02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
began i think 20 years ago now
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
and we canceled it because we had
 
02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
achieved our objective of getting people
 
02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:48.309 align:start position:0%
achieved our objective of getting people
to

02:57:48.309 --> 02:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:57:50.150 --> 02:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
believe in affordable housing in our
 
02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
region on
 
02:57:56.070 --> 02:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
we had um we
 
02:57:58.950 --> 02:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
we were after dartmouth hitchcock to do
 
02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:00.070 align:start position:0%
we were after dartmouth hitchcock to do
similarly

02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
02:58:02.630 --> 02:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
since 20 years ago and it's taken that
 
02:58:03.990 --> 02:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
long for them
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
to get to this point but also that land
 
02:58:07.830 --> 02:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
that i
 
02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
i am pretty sure that it's i know that
 
02:58:12.389 --> 02:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
it's not their land that they are
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
intending on
 
02:58:15.910 --> 02:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
building on because they'd have to get
 
02:58:17.590 --> 02:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
the zoning changed and that would be a
 
02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:19.349 align:start position:0%
the zoning changed and that would be a
fight

02:58:19.349 --> 02:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
fight
 
02:58:22.469 --> 02:58:22.479 align:start position:0%
because their land has a lot of valuable
 
02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
green space
 
02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
and people get upset at them
 
02:58:29.269 --> 02:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
and a lot of animals that live on it
 
02:58:29.279 --> 02:58:30.790 align:start position:0%
and a lot of animals that live on it
presently

02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
presently
 
02:58:35.030 --> 02:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
so um they are building on right next to
 
02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
their land on and bought a plot that had
 
02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:39.110 align:start position:0%
their land on and bought a plot that had
been

02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think up for sale actually for a
 
02:58:43.190 --> 02:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
very long time
 
02:58:46.870 --> 02:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
and um they're the ones that are
 
02:58:49.030 --> 02:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
threatened currently and now i think
 
02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
that they're already under a lawsuit
 
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's delaying them but
 
02:58:58.950 --> 02:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
um they they are almost certain to
 
02:59:01.510 --> 02:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
get permission to do that in the future
 
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
what the terms of their contract they
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
found the contractor they helped design
 
02:59:10.309 --> 02:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
everything on i don't know maybe the
 
02:59:10.319 --> 02:59:11.349 align:start position:0%
everything on i don't know maybe the
hanover

02:59:11.349 --> 02:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
hanover
 
02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
people also know something about this
 
02:59:15.030 --> 02:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
but on
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
what the terms their contract are and
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
how much they're actually putting into
 
02:59:21.670 --> 02:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
it aside from technical help
 
02:59:24.389 --> 02:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
on as versus the contractor himself i'm
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
02:59:34.630 --> 02:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:38.469 --> 02:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
i don't see anybody else so thank you
 
02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
dean and ben that was an
 
02:59:45.750 --> 02:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation i'm sorry could i
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
i had another question which i forgot in
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
answering that one could i ask him
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
02:59:56.309 --> 02:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if foreclosures
 
02:59:58.870 --> 02:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
are more going to be more attractive to
 
02:59:58.880 --> 02:59:59.670 align:start position:0%
are more going to be more attractive to
lenders

02:59:59.670 --> 02:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
lenders
 
03:00:03.110 --> 03:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
than uh trying to renegotiate as we're
 
03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
coming out of this
 
03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
because there is high demand in the
 
03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:08.230 align:start position:0%
because there is high demand in the
market

03:00:08.230 --> 03:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
market
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
and they can sell them quickly back
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
after the great recession
 
03:00:13.750 --> 03:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
they were stuck with places they'd
 
03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
foreclosed on for years
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
and they tried not to foreclose quite
 
03:00:20.469 --> 03:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
frequently because of that
 
03:00:23.590 --> 03:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
um because they couldn't get rid of them
 
03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
so we had one in my complex
 
03:00:29.349 --> 03:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
and it took two years before somebody
 
03:00:32.309 --> 03:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't couldn't that be a factor or do
 
03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
you have some reasons
 
03:00:42.070 --> 03:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
that you think would mitigate against
 
03:00:43.269 --> 03:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
that well
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
i i think that generally most lenders
 
03:00:48.870 --> 03:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
would prefer not to foreclose i mean it
 
03:00:50.950 --> 03:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
is a complicated and expensive
 
03:00:53.429 --> 03:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
process there are there's risks of
 
03:00:53.439 --> 03:00:54.870 align:start position:0%
process there are there's risks of
litigation

03:00:54.870 --> 03:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
03:00:57.750 --> 03:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors that that play
 
03:00:57.760 --> 03:00:58.389 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors that that play
there

03:00:58.389 --> 03:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:01:01.830 --> 03:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
you are right that the market dynamics
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
now are very different than they were
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
10 years ago and and one of the factors
 
03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:06.950 align:start position:0%
10 years ago and and one of the factors
that

03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:09.670 --> 03:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
that does has to be taken into
 
03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
consideration is how easily will you
 
03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:12.950 align:start position:0%
consideration is how easily will you
resell

03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
resell
 
03:01:15.750 --> 03:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
a property if you take it back um again
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
i point out that 70
 
03:01:20.950 --> 03:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
of or 68 or something like that of the
 
03:01:22.150 --> 03:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
loans in new hampshire
 
03:01:25.110 --> 03:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
are federally supported and so the those
 
03:01:27.510 --> 03:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
institutions are really deciding
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the end um what the path will be to
 
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
unravel things for those those problems
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
and i i suspect that the the policy sort
 
03:01:39.030 --> 03:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
of directive there will be to try to
 
03:01:40.790 --> 03:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
avoid foreclosure if it is
 
03:01:45.429 --> 03:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
at all possible um for the remaining 30
 
03:01:48.309 --> 03:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
um i can't speak to be honest i would
 
03:01:50.309 --> 03:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
think that most lenders again would
 
03:01:52.870 --> 03:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
prefer to work with an existing borrower
 
03:01:55.429 --> 03:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
if they can and given low interest rates
 
03:01:57.190 --> 03:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
in many cases they should be able to
 
03:01:58.469 --> 03:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
modify loans
 
03:02:01.349 --> 03:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
um but there there probably will be some
 
03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which that's just not
 
03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:04.150 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which that's just not
possible

03:02:04.150 --> 03:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:02:06.469 --> 03:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
and you might see a little bit of an
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
uptick in foreclosures
 
03:02:11.110 --> 03:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
at some point um down the road but
 
03:02:14.309 --> 03:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
again you know up till now most lenders
 
03:02:17.670 --> 03:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
are being very supportive of
 
03:02:20.870 --> 03:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
um i think their clients the one
 
03:02:23.030 --> 03:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
space where there might be a unique
 
03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:24.230 align:start position:0%
space where there might be a unique
challenge

03:02:24.230 --> 03:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
03:02:28.309 --> 03:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
is manufactured housing um
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
because um most manufactured housing
 
03:02:31.439 --> 03:02:32.070 align:start position:0%
because um most manufactured housing
units

03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
units
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for the federal
 
03:02:35.990 --> 03:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
protections because they were not
 
03:02:39.269 --> 03:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
financed with mortgages that have those
 
03:02:42.309 --> 03:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
federal attachments to them if you will
 
03:02:44.230 --> 03:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
and so if there's a sort of a small
 
03:02:45.670 --> 03:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
subset that could be
 
03:02:48.389 --> 03:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
at higher risk it would likely be
 
03:02:48.399 --> 03:02:49.830 align:start position:0%
at higher risk it would likely be
manufactured

03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured
 
03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
housing much of which is uh financed
 
03:02:55.870 --> 03:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
by what i would describe as
 
03:02:55.880 --> 03:02:57.429 align:start position:0%
by what i would describe as
non-traditional

03:02:57.429 --> 03:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
non-traditional
 
03:03:00.550 --> 03:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
lenders that is not local banks or
 
03:03:04.230 --> 03:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
or credit unions but by sort of national
 
03:03:05.429 --> 03:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
entities that focus
 
03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
principally on manufactured housing and
 
03:03:09.950 --> 03:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
i guess if there was going to be a
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
a segment of the market i would really
 
03:03:13.830 --> 03:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
worry about
 
03:03:17.110 --> 03:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
it would be that segment um as we come
 
03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
out of this and i can't predict
 
03:03:21.030 --> 03:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
how that will go but that would be one
 
03:03:23.910 --> 03:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
that i would be concerned about
 
03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
would i have a follow-up with the
 
03:03:29.910 --> 03:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's a third of the manufactured
 
03:03:31.510 --> 03:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
housing in new hampshire now
 
03:03:34.630 --> 03:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
is in cooperatives that are
 
03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh the guardian is the new hampshire
 
03:03:40.550 --> 03:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh charitable loan fund and you're
 
03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh charitable loan fund and you're
absolutely

03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
thanks to work with them so you're
 
03:03:44.550 --> 03:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely right
 
03:03:46.469 --> 03:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
and and a lot of banks do that we also
 
03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
work with them with some fannie mae
 
03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
work with them with some fannie mae
products

03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
products
 
03:03:51.190 --> 03:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
which basically will provide the same
 
03:03:53.110 --> 03:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
protections to individuals
 
03:03:56.230 --> 03:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
but it's really the remaining
 
03:03:58.630 --> 03:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
um um folks that i would be concerned
 
03:03:58.640 --> 03:03:59.349 align:start position:0%
um um folks that i would be concerned
about

03:03:59.349 --> 03:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:04:01.269 --> 03:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
and we will follow up mr chairman by the
 
03:04:02.950 --> 03:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
way with uh on the questions we were
 
03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:03.510 align:start position:0%
way with uh on the questions we were
asked

03:04:03.510 --> 03:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
asked
 
03:04:05.590 --> 03:04:05.600 align:start position:0%

uh for thursday
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
are we not meeting in the afternoon or
 
03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
are we doing something
 
03:07:08.309 --> 03:07:08.319 align:start position:0%

03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the second one do you have any idea
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
what they're planning on doing with this
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
for lunch
 
03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to go to this but i do not
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
want to eat
 
03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
with my mask off for lunch what after
 
03:07:30.319 --> 03:07:31.269 align:start position:0%
with my mask off for lunch what after
saturday

03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
saturday
 
03:07:38.790 --> 03:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
yeah at the sessions as far as
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
the choice they've asked you to fill out
 
03:07:46.469 --> 03:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
what you want i have no idea how we're
 
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to eat it
 
03:07:50.230 --> 03:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
was that brought up at the chairman's
 
03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
meeting this morning uh no it wasn't
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
it wasn't uh my understanding is we're
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
going to be spaced
 
03:07:59.429 --> 03:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
even further apart than uh we were at
 
03:07:59.439 --> 03:07:59.910 align:start position:0%
even further apart than uh we were at
the

03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
unh ice hockey rink
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
so that's something
 
03:08:08.469 --> 03:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
and i brought a special sandwich that i
 
03:08:09.910 --> 03:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
could try to eat
 
03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:16.870 --> 03:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
also my understanding is that the lunch
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
is not going to last
 
03:08:21.349 --> 03:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
that long the period of time because
 
03:08:24.070 --> 03:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of bills and and um the
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
first day ends at five
 
03:08:27.269 --> 03:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
can't run over they have to break down
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
the room for the event that the evening
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
the second day we have to break it three
 
03:08:33.030 --> 03:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
unless that's changed
 
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh so it's a very limited amount of time
 
03:08:37.830 --> 03:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
to do all these first committee bills
 
03:08:38.790 --> 03:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
well they're trying to and we're
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
starting at nine i guess as well which
 
03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:54.150 --> 03:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
major this is chris yes um i know you
 
03:08:58.070 --> 03:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
you have
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
bill work until two o'clock on wednesday
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
but i just want to make the committee
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
aware if you are done your work
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm at 2 30 house finance is hearing
 
03:09:09.429 --> 03:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
from the governor on the budget
 
03:09:12.870 --> 03:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
and the zoom link is in the calendar so
 
03:09:14.790 --> 03:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
and your committee's done its work you
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
may want to just hear
 
03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
um some of the questions that come from
 
03:09:22.229 --> 03:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
house finance and you may
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
um you'll find a friend on finance that
 
03:09:25.830 --> 03:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
could ask some questions you might have
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
about some of the changes that are being
 
03:09:27.279 --> 03:09:28.950 align:start position:0%
about some of the changes that are being
proposed

03:09:28.950 --> 03:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:34.389 --> 03:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we'll be through by 2 30
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
because it's a pretty busy day tomorrow
 
03:09:39.429 --> 03:09:39.439 align:start position:0%
but it looks like it in the calendar but
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
i just
 
03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
it was more the second part of my
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
statement you know if there's
 
03:09:45.269 --> 03:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
somebody on finance you a member wants
 
03:09:46.550 --> 03:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
to reach out to to maybe
 
03:09:49.349 --> 03:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
ask a certain question you might have um
 
03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
there may be an opportunity to do that
 
03:09:54.630 --> 03:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
and it's probably being recorded
 
03:10:06.070 --> 03:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
