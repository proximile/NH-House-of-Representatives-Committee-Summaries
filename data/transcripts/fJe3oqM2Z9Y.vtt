00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
but it's I don't know is it isn't that
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
too late to uh bill you don't you have
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative Waltz
 
00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:57.890 align:start position:0%
representative Waltz

yeah
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay so uh for 85 we had a an amendment
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh and that was the request so the
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
psychologists to be added to the to the
 
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.129 align:start position:0%
psychologists to be added to the to the
list

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419 align:start position:0%
Mr Sharon may I ask a question yes
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
um why not go ahead with
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
um just making uh
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
the just getting rid of the requirement
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
for uh pre-authorization why does this
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
need a study committee
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
okay so as we learned in the public
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
hearing that the
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the issue of the
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
Mandate of getting rid of the uh any
 
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
requirements for uh approval from an
 
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:10.220 align:start position:0%
insurance company is unnecessary because
 
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
uh for all intents and purposes that
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
that has already been mandated and that
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
is when back when when we mandated that
 
00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:21.019 align:start position:0%
mental health parity
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
existed that is matched to health care
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
when you show up in the emergency room
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
or if you have an accident there is no
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
need to have an insurance company uh
 
00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
approve it so the only reason we're
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
passing this
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
and remember this is just the amendment
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
so that's in the statute that's in the
 
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
bill the only reason in my mind we're
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
passing it because it's already
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
occurring is that we want to make sure
 
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
that anybody who thinks
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
that they need to get prior approval
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
from insurance company that if they were
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
to read the law they would find out that
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't
 
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
not that anybody reads the law when
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
they're in this kind of Crisis but we
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
want to make a statement a message to
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:13.019 align:start position:0%
that if you're having a mental health
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
crisis you do not need to get insurance
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
pre-approval to get care
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
sorry uh
 
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
so I have not checked the amendment
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
against the existing version of the bill
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh my apologies but
 
00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:36.410 align:start position:0%
uh my apologies but
um

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
so are we keeping that part of the bill
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
that provides that if a mobile crisis
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
unit shows up pre-authorization is not
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
required yes
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
so just so everybody and I know you're
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
new but it's just for everybody who's on
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
the committee when you ever you look at
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
you always have to look very carefully
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
at the very very very top of the bill so
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
it says the mill amend the bill by
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
replacing section three
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
section one will be the title section
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
two would be this this
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
mandate that we're talking about and
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
then section three was the commission
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I I did
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
actually understand that as I said I
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
simply hadn't checked uh what section
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
three said I had not had a chance to do
 
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.630 align:start position:0%
three said I had not had a chance to do
that

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
um but that's all we're taking out we're
 
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
not taking out I'm not taking anything
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
out we're adding another sentence to
 
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
section three thank you
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
so nothing has been deleted yes
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative Spirit if I have a let's
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
say I have a what what might be called a
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
mental I guess emergency yes
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
if I were to go to a private doctor
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
you know call up my doctor and he says
 
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
well no you can't go to a therapist
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
right now you can't go to a psychiatrist
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever without prior approval
 
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
is that covered by current statute
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh well I I guess let me let's read the
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
language of the statue I don't know it
 
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.430 align:start position:0%
language of the statue I don't know it
was

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know somebody who is familiar with
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
this issue would want to speak to this
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
question of that if I just called up my
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
my local social worker and and do I you
 
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
know will this statue help them the idea
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
is that we wanted to keep folks give
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
them another option rather than just
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
rush off to the emergency room we know
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
without ideas we don't want them to go
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
to emergency room so if I were to go to
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
my doctor
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
am I still allowed by Statute to get
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
covered without prior authorization uh
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
well the old statue was you you get five
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
visits without
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
prior authorization but so once you
 
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
state your name and
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
hi everyone thank you my name is Ms Vini
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'm the children's Behavioral Health
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
policy coordinator at new Futures we um
 
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
collaborated with Senator Bradley on
 
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I should note that I'm not a
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
practicing psychologist or social worker
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
so I my area expertise is a little
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
Limited in this section but I will say
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
that if you were to call your doctor
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
um and he is not providing emergency
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
care I don't believe that would fall
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
under the emerge the definition of
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services in this bill however
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
the point of that section is to include
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis teams which are a new
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
um sort of system in New Hampshire they
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
just rolled out Statewide recently with
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
the rollout of 988 so if you call your
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
doctor and you say I'm in a mental
 
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
health emergency your doctor can put you
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
in touch with the 988 mobile crisis
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
teams and then those Services would be
 
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.710 align:start position:0%
teams and then those Services would be
covered

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
without prior authorization to be clear
 
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Gibbs
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
um okay I'm asking me a question or
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
asking her a question
 
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.030 align:start position:0%
asking her a question
uh

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
I'm actually responding to the earlier
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
question if I may
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure thank you uh okay something I don't
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
usually discuss in public uh but I can
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
tell you from personal experience
 
00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
um that some such services are already
 
00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:22.019 align:start position:0%
covered for multiple visits
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
um some are not but as I understand it
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
at least some of that is because some uh
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
such practitioners don't accept
 
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.690 align:start position:0%
such practitioners don't accept
Insurance

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
um uh but a lot of it is already covered
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh that's the best I could tell you and
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for every form of
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
insurance just the ones I'm familiar
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
with thank you okay
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative purcelli
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
Stan the tonight
 
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
you know Insurance types so would this
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
be the individual Mark I mean who is oh
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
well we can regulate in this committee
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
and by said what we can do is uh we are
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
affecting the what they call the small
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
group Market
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
and the individual Market
 
00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:20.660 align:start position:0%
okay the uh who is not included in that
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh anybody who is Medicare
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
everyone uh everyone who has a large
 
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
everyone uh everyone who has a large
employer

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
that is federally regulated and that is
 
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.470 align:start position:0%
that is federally regulated and that is
erises

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
erises
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
and uh ironically Rissa that the state
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
state employees are under a Risa plan
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh my County
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
Health Plan is an erisa plan
 
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
so we cannot mandate anything into erisa
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
plans but historically they generally if
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
we do pass something they then generally
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
follow suit but yes this does not uh
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:11.300 align:start position:0%
so it's a rather small
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh I would say it's a fifth
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you can call us about you
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
know at least a fifth
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
population but
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
I mean you have to remember Medicare you
 
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
know everybody's over 65 that's a whole
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
nother ball of action and and Medicaid's
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
100 posts here
 
00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:38.269 align:start position:0%
100 posts here
okay

00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.249 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
um I found another question okay
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
so uh just on the I want to be clear on
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
the funding
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
so we're establishing a study committee
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
to look at some of the how where is the
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
funding so that's the problem right now
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
um we have this new concept of this this
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
quick action team
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
um as you all probably been paying
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
attention if you read the newspapers the
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
big credit is we don't want
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
people having Mental Health crisis
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
showing up at the hospital
 
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
uh it's a problem you know the hospitals
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
I mean I have to say I I first hand my
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
mother was in a cardiac event and that
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
that was the room next door that was
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
someone having a mental health crisis
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
and she was yelling and screaming and
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
just it it no we just want to but so
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
that's why we have this quick action
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
team so the question is that one we know
 
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies we can are now
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
are covering this quick action team but
 
00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:03.500 align:start position:0%
we need to how else of those other
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
four-fifths how do we make sure that
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
they're also being covered and that's
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
as quick as we were okay
 
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.450 align:start position:0%
as quick as we were okay
um

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
all right so this is the wrong one I
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
technology

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.690 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.110 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
so you're off the hook now because
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative post is now here
 
00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:14.029 align:start position:0%
representative post is now here
okay

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
so you're you're off the hook you're off
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
the hook cause right now right now we
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
have uh Terry and Vincent are being
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
paired okay
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
all right so that means we have one two
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
three four
 
00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
five six people here
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
all right anybody would like to make the
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:45.409 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:45.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open up the uh work
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
session on the amendment to Senate bill
 
00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:46.909 align:start position:0%
session on the amendment to Senate bill
98.

00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
98.
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'd start off by apologizing
 
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
to everybody that you're only getting it
 
00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:53.090 align:start position:0%
to everybody that you're only getting it
now

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
kind of hope that we were going to get
 
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
it on Friday
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
but the procedures and process for
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
legislative Services is I think it was
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
done but then they had to re-read it and
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
they have to go through it to make sure
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
everything is working and that didn't
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
happen until unfortunately this morning
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
given the holiday or the Memorial Day
 
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh event yesterday
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
um and they also use the the budget as
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay so uh before I get into it I just
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
want to kind of set the stage where
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
everybody understands where we are with
 
00:30:35.159 --> 00:30:36.830 align:start position:0%
everybody understands where we are with
this

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
um we obviously have no idea whether the
 
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
governor or the Senate is gonna
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
like what we have in front of us because
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
it's all new and improved
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
we do have a
 
00:30:54.529 --> 00:30:54.539 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton's bill that we
 
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
retained which is very similar to what
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
this bill does
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
so that if whatever happens we know that
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
we have that action that we will uh we
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
can then come back in uh September
 
00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:10.690 align:start position:0%
can then come back in uh September
October

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:10.700 align:start position:0%

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
544 house bill 544.
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs you have a question
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Sharon
 
00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.610 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Sharon
uh

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
some of the words
 
00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
um did not print out correctly
 
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and I am looking at uh page seven
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
um section 318 F7 regulation of cannabis
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh the first line says all and then
 
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
there's a word that starts with p u but
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that word is and then
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
I have a more general question if I may
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
but what is that word purchase
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
all purchase of cannabis shall be made
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
by the commission directly so we're on
 
00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:14.990 align:start position:0%
by the commission directly so we're on
page

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:18.020 align:start position:0%
seven seven
 
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:22.220 align:start position:0%
and on page seven line
 
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
23 23
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
all retail Cannabis stores shall be
 
00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:30.980 align:start position:0%
operated by the state of New Hampshire
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
oh oh the pay oh you know a lot of the
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
words didn't come through I couldn't
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
tell but some of them were but is that
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
one supposed to be purchased I I would
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh it I can see that the this is a
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
um this is a mistake of The copier yeah
 
00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:52.669 align:start position:0%
um this is a mistake of The copier yeah
John

00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
John
 
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
I had the original somehow I ended up
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
with the original and it got expanded
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
when it got printed if you want the
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
original I have it somehow I got it I
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
don't know why uh and the words are all
 
00:33:05.169 --> 00:33:05.179 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay so what does that word Carrie
 
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
what page are you on
 
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:57.190 align:start position:0%
what page are you on
insurance

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's classes as required
 
00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:31.010 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's classes as required
okay

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
oh it's all over it's all through it but
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
a lot of them I could figure out it was
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
just that one
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
because then I have a question because
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
it still says all retail Cannabis stores
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
shall be operated by the state and then
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
two paragraphs down it says the
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
commission may licensed persons who
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
operate agency Cannabis stores and it's
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
so I have to refer to the review uh
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
every page is wrong uh because the
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
backside it's missing the left hand side
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's missing numbers and and names and
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
stuff so literally every piece of paper
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
is printed wrong okay so it turns out
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
there was one there's only one copy or
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
one machine that's upstairs obviously
 
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
the PDF is fine so they're going to
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do but
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I I would have to say I I could not
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
with a uh we cannot you know the full
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee cannot take up this bill
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
unless we have a proper for everybody to
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
look at okay but in the meanwhile may I
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
ask a substantive question yes that
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
would be great uh okay uh you didn't
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
want me to talk and explain the bill
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
first I'm sorry you already know
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
that you you I might answer your
 
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.030 align:start position:0%
that you you I might answer your
question

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
um well let me ask the question and then
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
please go ahead and explain I would
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate it great okay uh so we're
 
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
back online 23 uh but these words came
 
00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
through forget about the words just tell
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
me what your what your question is okay
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
all retail cannabis store shall be
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
operated by the state correct but then
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
two paragraphs down on line 33 it says
 
00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:29.339 align:start position:0%
the commission may license persons to
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
operate agency Cannabis stores that
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
appears to be a contradiction okay that
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
is your question okay that's my question
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
all right so what we what we have done
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
um taken what is currently existing here
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
and that is agency stores
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
so I guess the first question is anybody
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
not know what an agency store is please
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you don't know what
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
an agency store I know representative
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
spear learned about it for the first
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
time 10 minutes ago does everyone here
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
know what an agency store is uh do I
 
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
understand correctly that a store
 
00:37:14.089 --> 00:37:14.099 align:start position:0%
licensed by The Liquor Commission so yes
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
they are regulated that and and the key
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
element is that these stores are located
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
in places where the Liquor Commission
 
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
would have put a liquor store
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
but because of their location it would
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
did not make economic sense for the
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
commission to operate that the selling
 
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
liquor out of that location so what
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
occurs in an agency store is that
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
um we the glicker commission is in
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
control it's you know they has a Liquor
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
Commission computer has a Liquor
 
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
Commission point of sale system it has
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
in the where the actual Liquors being
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
sold and so it is uh the best way I
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
would I would kind of give you a figure
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
of what they what they are is visualize
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
that at some gas stations they have a
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts in it
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
and that Dunkin Donuts is being operated
 
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
by you know
 
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
by an affiliate by Dunkin Donuts or some
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
franchisee so there is or Subway does
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
the same thing they're in gas age you'll
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
see them in inside located like warm
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
every Walmart has a Subway or some
 
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
somebody else in there or a Dunkin
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
Donuts so that imagine that's what we're
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
doing is that the location these liquor
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
stores that are inside these stores are
 
00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:40.970 align:start position:0%
stores that are inside these stores are
actually

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh the rent and the facilities and
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
caught some of those costs are being
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
operated by
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
a third party
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
um I have to admit when when the
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
commission came back to me and said well
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
what do you think John and I was very
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
jealous that I had not thought of this
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
in the first place because the agency
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
store doesn't have a tax there's no tax
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
because this liquor that's sold in those
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
facilities is still sold by the
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
commission they're controlling the
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
commission but they're in that location
 
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
so for those of you who really wanted to
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
have private Enterprise involved in the
 
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:23.300 align:start position:0%
sale of marijuana
 
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
that's what an agency store is
 
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
and so therefore it made perfect sense
 
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
to take the atcs
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
and resolve that issue so we wouldn't
 
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
have to figure out a fee or a tax or
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
something that that how they were you
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
know like we had when the original Bill
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
where we had the you know the 10 and
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
then 15 and then they settled at 10 and
 
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
12 and a half percent from ways and
 
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
means we don't have any of that because
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
the operations of these in these stores
 
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
it will be the Liquor Commission is
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
operating them inside these private
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
Enterprises representative spear
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
and so just to get it straight in my
 
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
head The Liquor Commission still
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
operates or licenses licenses these
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
facilities correct but a private
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
individual can own it and and own it
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay you have in one place you have
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
slightly different topic
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
possession limits
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
where you talk about anything over four
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
ounces of cannabis and plant form and
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
possession that's under the marijuana
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
you know regulations that really not
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
later on you talk about
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
so it's illegal to have more than that
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
in your possession correct
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
a little later on you have a section
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
that talks about how the police are not
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to spend any effort whatsoever
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
going after anyone who's
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
that they believe may be operating that
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:11.099 align:start position:0%
page six yeah
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
no law enforcement officer employed by
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
an agency that receives state or local
 
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
government funds shall expend any state
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
or local resources including the
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
officer's time to affect any arrest or
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
seizure of cannabis or or conduct any
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
investigation on the soul bus
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
basis of activity the officer believes
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
to constitute a violation of federal law
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
of the office
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
Etc et cetera et cetera so in other
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
words you can't get arrested but you're
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
not allowed to have it
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
it seems contradictory to me that that
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
was uh having the police
 
00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.150 align:start position:0%
was uh having the police
um

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
make it an effort to go find somebody in
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
other words if you were pulled over in a
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh for speeding
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
and you have a joint on your dash of
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
your car
 
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.510 align:start position:0%
your car
okay

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
at this point the that is less than four
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
ounces but if you happen to have a pound
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
of marijuana sitting in the backseat of
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
your car
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
and the cop can't fail to notice it
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
then yes they can arrest you for it okay
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
but they're not going to
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh set up roadblock let's say like we do
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
for alcohol where we have these where we
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
have to print in the newspaper and that
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to have them out there and
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be stopping every car
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
and and you that's what they're saying
 
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:41.180 align:start position:0%
just don't they can't do that
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question if I have a
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts franchise I have to do
 
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
everything by the letter I mean every
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts store is the same you have
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
the same Donuts they they do everything
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
the same same amount of coffee yada yada
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
it's laid out the same yeah I guess my
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
question is if um the atcs are are
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
agency stores do they feel that they're
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
going to be able to run it the way that
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
they need to run it I'd like to ask Matt
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
Simon what he thinks
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for the question
 
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to comment for the
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
record Matt Simon Prime Etc
 
00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:32.420 align:start position:0%
uh I think we need a lot more
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
explanation of how agency stores could
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
work for cannabis in general before we
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
can understand whether atc's could serve
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
as agency stores
 
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
and I also just want to point out the
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of us is different
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
than what I reviewed over the weekend it
 
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
it actually oh yeah on page
 
00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.450 align:start position:0%
it actually oh yeah on page
for

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.609 align:start position:0%
for
uh

00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
line I'm not sure because of the print
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
job but towards the bottom definition of
 
00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:04.819 align:start position:0%
dual use
 
00:44:04.819 --> 00:44:06.770 align:start position:0%
dual use

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
that says means license allowing an Etc
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
to co-locate with and operate a retail
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
cannabis store that's what it said in a
 
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
previous version I was under the
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
impression that was going to be changed
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
to agency store
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
this currently says atcs could operate a
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
retail cannabis store
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
which we like from a policy perspective
 
00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.410 align:start position:0%
which we like from a policy perspective
but

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
plainly contradicts the language on page
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
one line
 
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
29 that says all retail Cannabis stores
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
shall be operated by the state of New
 
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.250 align:start position:0%
shall be operated by the state of New
Hampshire

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
and while I'm at it I think that same
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
line 29 directly contradicts the
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
language about agency stores as as
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
you've suggested would
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
agency stores are licensed their their
 
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
private stores they're licensed by The
 
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission but the stores are not
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
operated by The Liquor Commission unless
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm unless I'm missing something
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
so if atcs are to like to operate as
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
agency stores we have a number of
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
questions one
 
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
can we sell our own products that we
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
produce if so do we have to sell them to
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission and buy them back
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh that seems like a major impediment
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
particularly if you think that that may
 
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
be preempted and there may not be a
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
state-run system uh
 
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
with regard to selling we would like to
 
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
sell products from other companies as
 
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
well when I go to the store in
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
they sell their brand and it's about a
 
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
third of the menu is stuff that they
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
produce and then they have 20 different
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
companies products that I could also
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
choose from and those that's the kind of
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
Market that we'd like to participate in
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
where we can sell our products and help
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
create a market for products from other
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
Growers and manufacturers so I can see
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
how the agency store model might work
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to selling other Growers and
 
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
other manufacturers products
 
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how our cannabis gets
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
from our grow facility to our stores
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
and I would love it if somebody could
 
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
explain that before well it's fine uh as
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
I told you before that would be done
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
through rule making between the
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
commission and you so if you
 
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
want to have that answered then I guess
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
we won't go forward with this bill
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
simple as that because
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
I guess we have a chicken in the egg
 
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
problem now
 
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
you want to know what the rules are
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
before we pass it
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have I guess all we can do is
 
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
create legislative Authority for the
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
Department to do a rule
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
but generally we would have to pass a
 
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.930 align:start position:0%
but generally we would have to pass a
statute

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
for them to make that rule
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
so we have a chicken in the egg problem
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I respectively would
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
characterize this as a problem of
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
contradictions in the legislative
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
language so how would you fix that
 
00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
language to not have this question is
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
can I
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
can you will you be able to sell your
 
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
own cannabis
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
in this cannabis in your ATC to
 
00:47:16.859 --> 00:47:19.730 align:start position:0%
in this cannabis in your ATC to
retailers

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
at this point I don't know I I don't
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
know what I'm looking at I'm looking at
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
a very contradictory piece of
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that's uh perfect
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
that you've said enough fair enough all
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
right I I would guess that at this point
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
we can all agree this amendment is not
 
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you uh
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
this question is for you
 
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
um okay I am not sure honestly about the
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
procedure for
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis going back and forth from the
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
grower in The Liquor Commission perhaps
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
because of that this bill really isn't
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
ready to go forward honestly I'm not
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
sure but there is something that I think
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
we can fix
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
um and that is the language on line 29
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
of page one and the same language on
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
line 23 of page seven where they both
 
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
say all retail Cannabis stores shall be
 
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
operated by the state of New Hampshire
 
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be changed to all recent
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
all retail Cannabis stores shall be
 
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:26.900 align:start position:0%
operated by the state of New Hampshire
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
or a licensed agency store or ATC that
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
would seem to solve
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
a large problem of contradiction
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't sound like because he
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
wants to know the rules well he wants to
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
know what the works are you saying that
 
00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
one sentence that she just said would
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
take away your question about what of
 
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
the rules were necessary about how you
 
00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think we've been clear all
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
along that we want Clarity in the
 
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
definition of retail cannabis store
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
Clarity and the definition of of dual
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
use certificate Clarity and the
 
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
definition of agency store we've
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
provided suggested language that would
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
clarify those definitions so that rules
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
could be made to accommodate the intent
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
but I don't understand how any
 
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
commission is supposed to write rules to
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
implement a law that says two completely
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
different and contradictory things
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking under the rule
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
making section
 
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:32.540 align:start position:0%
which specifically says the department
 
00:49:37.329 --> 00:49:37.339 align:start position:0%
is going to generate a rule to allow
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
an agency store and it says retail
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
cannabis store are you looking in the
 
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
first the statute I'm talking about the
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
rulemaking section I'm going back to the
 
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.329 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:49:56.339 --> 00:49:57.349 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:57.359 --> 00:50:00.589 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
if if uh if we want to it's I guess the
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
next question I have is is if we could
 
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
just correct this one sentence is this
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
the only sentence anybody has a problem
 
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.569 align:start position:0%
the only sentence anybody has a problem
with

00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
okay two sentences in this with the same
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
language in two different places so if
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
we fix those two sentences is everybody
 
00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
no we understand that you that you and
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of other Republicans
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
are not too crazy about the bill
 
00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:34.790 align:start position:0%
are not too crazy about the bill
yeah

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
oh you don't like it
 
00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
the cross
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
the process to me I've been around for
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
20 20 years here in the state house and
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
this process has been
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
unbelievable Shady it it's just not the
 
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
way we should conduct business I don't
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
know who's drafting these amendments but
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
whoever is drafting the Amendments
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
aren't part of the Cannabis commission
 
00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
that was instructed to come up with
 
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
legislation that we could all pass what
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
commit candidates for commission the one
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
the one that that never did anything
 
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
well this oh that's right you want to
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
rely on the new Senate one right you
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
want the new Senate commission to take
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
care of this no there was a group that
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
came together no they were not a
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
commission that was an ad hoc committee
 
00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:21.059 align:start position:0%
that came together that came up with a
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
solution right and that was a lot of
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and that was built on the
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
idea of private licensure yes yes so at
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
the end of the day
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
you the idea of the Liquor Commission
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
operating the stores is is uh right no
 
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
no no license but I'll
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay so I would say is that at this
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
point that's what this bill is and if
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
the committee does not want to go
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
forward with that then I would say we
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
just retain the bill
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
well we don't have to we can just go
 
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
past the underlying Bill and then and
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
just and we will do nothing with this
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
other issue and we'll take it up when we
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
do the amendment for Eaton's five
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
whatever Bill 540 yep
 
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
so actually I had their hands up first
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative Phil
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate the the concerns about
 
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
process and some of the concerns about
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh where the Cannabis will be sold but I
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
think we need to look at the the
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
overlying issue here of cannabis
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
legalization New Hampshire this is a a
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
long-standing issue and our constituents
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
are pretty clear of what they want to
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
have happen on this issue and they want
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
legal cannabis
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
that we can sit here and continue to
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
clutch our pearls over how we're going
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
to get this done
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
but we need to get it done and our
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
constituents have told us get it done
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
beyond that there's a social justice
 
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
issue here we have people who are
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
continually being arrested for what is
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
in effect a non-crime so we can quibble
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
about language we can continue to
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
quibble about where this is going to get
 
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.530 align:start position:0%
quibble about where this is going to get
sold

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
sold
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
or we can do our jobs get the
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
legislation passed and actually help
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
people who are actually being wrongfully
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for this so perhaps we can
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
actually begin to negotiate this
 
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
language and push this through or we can
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
let people get arrested for a non-crime
 
00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:20.870 align:start position:0%
let people get arrested for a non-crime
yes

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
okay representative it hasn't changed
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear from The Liquor
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
Commission about how these agency stores
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
might work is there anyone from The
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission present today I don't
 
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
see them here today they weren't here
 
00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
last meeting either so that's kind of
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
conspicuous that they're absent they
 
00:53:38.579 --> 00:53:39.530 align:start position:0%
conspicuous that they're absent they
they

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
um they are in an awkward position that
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of owning owning this
 
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
in terms of owning owning this
legislation

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
and um so yes I have asked them to help
 
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
me draft it
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
um but at the end of the day
 
00:53:58.609 --> 00:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
um if uh if people are uncomfortable and
 
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
want to have more details then I guess
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
we need to do a road trip and go visit
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
an agency store and and uh and and
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
understand how they operate if we're
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
going to do that however I'm hearing
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
over here that's necessarily over here
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing over here
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
someone who said they will never vote
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
for an agency soar concept
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
so how many people that how many people
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
let's do this to that straw poll how
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
many people are adamantly opposed to an
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
agency uh store concept for and rather
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
have the just the private Enterprise or
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
I have the like the original 639
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
who would rather have the 639 and not an
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
agency store
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
I see one two
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
the original Bill the original bill
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
which has it okay
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay so how many people would rather
 
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
have the six well you can remember the
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
difference was 639 have that 12 and a
 
00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
half percent tax
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
okay so how many people would rather
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
have 639 than agency stores
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
eight nine
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
well that's pretty close to Ten Ten
 
00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh look but Mr chairman
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
um the question at this point I think is
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
not would we rather have 639 yes I'd
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
rather have 639 but would I rather have
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
this or nothing because it's right let's
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
kill 639 right right well well actually
 
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:33.140 align:start position:0%
I'll be I'll be the
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
on this one if we don't pass agency
 
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.930 align:start position:0%
on this one if we don't pass agency
stores

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
it'll be 639 will have to literally wait
 
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
for a whole nother legislative election
 
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.450 align:start position:0%
for a whole nother legislative election
cycle

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
for that possibility to occur and it
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
would have to as from what I can see
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
from this little lowly position as a
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
state representative that would mean
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
that there has to be a radical change in
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
and it would have to be a change in the
 
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.890 align:start position:0%
and it would have to be a change in the
governor

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay but that that's what you're betting
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
on otherwise do you feel
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
like representative says is let's get
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
can be that can be enough that should be
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
a separate bill maybe it could be
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to another bill that we've
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
passed or retained but this is not going
 
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
to kill if we have to wait two more
 
00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:38.569 align:start position:0%
to kill if we have to wait two more
years

00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:38.579 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
we have to make wait two more years we
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
wait two more years this is not the
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
right way to do it got it
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
represent gifts yes thank you uh I'm a
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
with representative filio let's get
 
00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:53.579 align:start position:0%
something passed
 
00:56:53.579 --> 00:56:57.650 align:start position:0%
something passed
okay

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
um my feeling is that given what
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
happened with 639 and the way it went
 
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
down I don't trust a commission to get
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
this right next year well the commission
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
that's been created by the Senate no I
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
don't trust it no no you don't have to
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
trust it you know full well they will
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
come out with this bill as as we're
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
looking at it right now but what I want
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
to say is given that
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I think I mean I probably shouldn't
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
say this but I I think that commission
 
00:57:26.089 --> 00:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
will be stacked to get it the way where
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
they want it to go and given that I say
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
if we can get this bill language
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
um either now or retain it and do it
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
then I think that's preferable to
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
letting some Commission of who knows who
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
is going to be honest I would assume the
 
00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:42.020 align:start position:0%
commission will solve this ATC question
 
00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:44.819 align:start position:0%
they'll clarify that language I mean if
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
you think about it that gives us lots of
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
time I mean we'll have the time we can
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
we can fix all that language in this
 
00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
committee than in a commission
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
right so we would then be able to take
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
it up in September and and but it at the
 
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
point what I'm hearing right now is it's
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
the committee is split on having agency
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
store versus having the private
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
Enterprise 639
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
not to split it's not your split you
 
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
would vote for a agency you would vote
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
for agency store if we could fix this
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
bill got the definition right right I
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
could live with it okay
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
okay so so let's take a straw Bowl if we
 
00:58:30.049 --> 00:58:30.059 align:start position:0%
sit on this bill at this amendment until
 
00:58:30.059 --> 00:58:31.430 align:start position:0%
sit on this bill at this amendment until
September

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
September
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
and and fix it
 
00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
how many people would be willing to vote
 
00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:38.180 align:start position:0%
for it then it's a straw poll
 
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six and being
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
the fix is the language seven eight nine
 
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.930 align:start position:0%
the fix is the language seven eight nine
ten

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
let me know okay well
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
we're close enough with that one I guess
 
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh yeah as you all know I I don't have
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
any compelling reason to pass anything
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
because you know I like killing Bells so
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
so at this point if we want to just sit
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
on this until September and see how we
 
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
can we can do it
 
00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.770 align:start position:0%
can we can do it
um

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
and overcome that ten because even then
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're not really
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
fixing anything you know because there
 
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
will be plenty there's another 10 of you
 
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
which are not going to be happy with
 
00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:25.970 align:start position:0%
which are not going to be happy with
that

00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
but we are missing
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
we're missing two two members of the
 
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
committee so it's going to be tight but
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
we can certainly
 
00:59:38.289 --> 00:59:38.299 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes pull your microphone
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
this amendment jeopardizes the atcs and
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
we work no no we we agree that this
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
amendment is not is no good
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
we agreed this amendment as it is is no
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
good because it still has in the statute
 
00:59:56.569 --> 00:59:56.579 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that atcs are
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
in these agency stores right up front
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay and that we agency stores want to
 
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
know what the rules are on how they're
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
going to be able to operate
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
right right I want to know before I vote
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
on a bill but would you ever vote for
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
atc's as agency stores or would you
 
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
rather have the original 639
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
639 right now and that's the question is
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
is that is that a black and white
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
decision I mean in other words there are
 
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
some people here I saw representative
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
Paxton Institute say that they like 639
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
but they would treat a compromise being
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
this agency store as long as it was
 
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
clear what the rules are for an agency
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
store that an ATC as an agent is an
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
agent did you really clearly have a
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
visual what exactly how they how they
 
01:00:50.339 --> 01:00:53.390 align:start position:0%
visual what exactly how they how they
operate

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan why can't we do
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
a bill that addresses the very
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns that uh speak close
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
to the mic why can't we do a bill that
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
represents or that addresses the very
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
clear concerns that are very legitimate
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
about uh people getting arrested for him
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
like we can do I don't see a reason why
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
we can't legalize something and then
 
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
figure out how we're going to regulate
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
and sell it in a different Bill like we
 
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
could do that that was that that's a
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
different committee
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
that was that was in in criminal justice
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay so if that happens and we don't
 
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
have to rush this part of it yeah matter
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
of fact that whole sections all of that
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
is just
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
they're saying oh well now that you now
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
that you now that you've now made it
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
legal to sell it uh then we've got to
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
cover that material but that is true
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's all there that's in criminal
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
justice and whatever happened to that
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
bill to the Senate table they
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
they table that bill anybody know what
 
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
do they just kill it
 
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.829 align:start position:0%
do they just kill it
but

01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
they haven't taken it up yet
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so that's still but yes that
 
01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
is a separate issue I agree with you and
 
01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:09.299 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with this bill and and
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
frankly right from the get-go I didn't
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
even want to have that in this bill at
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
all because it I thought it would
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
cluttered up the issue but it just that
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
it was it was a Chicken and the Egg kind
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
of problem even I mean clearly I'm I
 
01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
don't really love this bill but in this
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
bill I'm still curious why do we have
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
any sort it seems like it's still
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
illegal to have say four ounces of
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
cannabis or more
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
I mean if we legalize something why is
 
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
there a limit I mean if I we once we
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
legalize beer we don't make a I can have
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
12 kegs in my truck driving home from
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
the store if I wanted to good point I
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
mean why is it still seems illegal at
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
some level
 
01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:44.339 align:start position:0%
so I don't know just another thing in
 
01:02:47.049 --> 01:02:47.059 align:start position:0%
this bill which I think is another week
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
for uh for the libertarian Spirit you
 
01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:51.500 align:start position:0%
might have
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
that this there is nothing when it comes
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
to regulating you know of Licensing or
 
01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
regulated marijuana is ever going to be
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
truly Live Free or Die it's always going
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
to be highly regulated I understand I'm
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with the regulations with
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
respect to you know the same way with
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol we have you have to be 21 to buy
 
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
it you can't drink with it drink and
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
drive whatever but like here it sounds
 
01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:15.059 align:start position:0%
like if somebody happened to
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
go to a store and it was on sale and
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
they bought a bunch to stock up and they
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
could be arrested because they had more
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
than four ounces I I'm just curious why
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
what is the logic behind uh well if I
 
01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:26.660 align:start position:0%
were to compare it to the liquor
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh don't ever buy more than ten thousand
 
01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of booze
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
uh because you will be reported
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
because of the cash transaction the size
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
of the transaction so you will notice
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
that and this has been an issue in the
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
past years uh with people who from out
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
of state
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
um I saw one at South Carolina license
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
plates and they were loading up their
 
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
Minivan and and then feeling it when I
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
drove by doing my my somewhat State
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
plates and and quickly threw a towel
 
01:04:00.119 --> 01:04:01.150 align:start position:0%
plates and and quickly threw a towel
over

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh cases and cases of Hennessy that's in
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
the back of their car unreported is it
 
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.930 align:start position:0%
the back of their car unreported is it
illegal

01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:07.940 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
well let me put it this way the illegal
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
aspect of that is taking it across state
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
lines okay that's fine but like we're
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
saying a New Hampshire resident who has
 
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
more than four ounces of cannabis could
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
theoretically be arrested it's not
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
actually legalize right so I mean I
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
think that I get your analogy but it's
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
not really analogous because that's like
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
taking something across the state lines
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
to a state where apparently that might
 
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
be illegal to buy it here and travel it
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
in but like if I wanted to go buy four
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
ounces I would be I don't know if it's
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
criminal uh I don't know if it's like uh
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely true you can buy as much
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
Hennessy as you want right here in New
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire why why do we except if you do
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
over ten thousand you have to be they
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
report you uh to I don't know the
 
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
Federal Federal Reserve ID you get
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
reported the fact you did this cash
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
transaction that's not really analogous
 
01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:00.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
they know the insight into why we have
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
that that's what I'm asking for it's for
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
you to explain to me why we have this I
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
mean just like we have the limit on 20
 
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
milligrams uh of of a dose what's that
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
20 milligrams dose no I'm talking about
 
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
so I'm just saying that we're we have
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
other regulations that have limits okay
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
like we have a limit on how when you buy
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
this stuff how much you can buy I mean
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
other states so remember if I told you
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
what what I've learned about
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is that you can only buy
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
up to 100 milligrams a day
 
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just saying so that's you can
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
limit how much somebody could buy but if
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
they're what happens if somebody's
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
caught with more than that does this
 
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
bill explain this I was only able to get
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
to page eight before we started talking
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
about it I just got it but like wow can
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
you explain to me what happens to
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
somebody if you're caught with 20 grams
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
of concentrated cannabis or four ounces
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
of cannabis like what happens to that
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
person are they arrested which is a
 
01:05:59.450 --> 01:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
problem that we're all concerned about
 
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
um I would I would say
 
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
that right now the way the Massachusetts
 
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
law is I do not know whether they go
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
after the individual who was able to get
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
more than 100 milligrams but I am
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
telling you that they absolutely limit
 
01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
the retailer I'm talking about but
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're lucky you're looking at the legal
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know what if you said to me let's
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
just get rid of all that legal self and
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
pass it in a separate bill that's all
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
fine and dandy but we can't pass this
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
bill until that one's been passed
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
in the Senate is has not signed it right
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
I mean the bill's not passed yet it's to
 
01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
and and then and I will venture to tell
 
01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:41.339 align:start position:0%
you if you think that the Senate would
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
ever pass a bill that you could have any
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
numeral number amount of marijuana
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
pounds of marijuana in your car it ain't
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
happening I agree I'm just trying to say
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't actually legalize it because
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
you can still get arrested for having
 
01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
that some quantity I actually I don't
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
know because you don't know what what
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
what would happen to this person either
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
sounds like like in my scenario you
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
can't tell me if that person goes to
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
jail if they get a fine
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
we don't know what happens that person
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's not in this is that where would
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
that be it doesn't say felony doesn't
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
say class I don't see any felony I have
 
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
to admit I never spent much time looking
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
in that section because that that's
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
nothing this committee works on that
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
that's a a criminal justice issue and
 
01:07:21.299 --> 01:07:22.250 align:start position:0%
that's a a criminal justice issue and
and

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
um it just seems weird to legalize
 
01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:24.890 align:start position:0%
um it just seems weird to legalize
something

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
but it's really not legalized gotcha all
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
right representative Gibbs again
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
um okay I don't know what's going to
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
happen with that other bill in the
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
Senate none of us do
 
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
um and I recognize that the limits on
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
the amount are political compromise
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
because I think that may make it more
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
palatable to some people
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of the precise limits on the
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
amount and personally I don't I would
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
say have no limits on the amount but
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
that's probably a political non-starter
 
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
um but since this bill is before the
 
01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
um but since this bill is before the
committee

01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
regardless of what
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
committee does or the Senate does
 
01:08:18.169 --> 01:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
couldn't we just strip out the part that
 
01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:20.150 align:start position:0%
couldn't we just strip out the part that
says

01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's legal to have up to x amount of
 
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.689 align:start position:0%
it's legal to have up to x amount of
marijuana

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
um just strip that part out and say you
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
can't get arrested for that and the
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
police won't search your car because
 
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
they smell marijuana which is in the
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
current Amendment since this bill is
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
before this committee if we just strip
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
out that part and leave out all the
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
complications about the dealerships
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
could we do that
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
so I would assume under our current law
 
01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.209 align:start position:0%
so I would assume under our current law
now

01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
you have possession issues I mean I
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
don't know what the possession law is
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
probably pretty low number so stripping
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
that out
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
we leave the current law that you can't
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
possess it so no trip it out and keep it
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
in other words just pull that part out
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
the part that
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of us want okay so people stop
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
getting arrested at least up to and
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
maybe four ounces is too small maybe it
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
should be higher I don't know but
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
because people are still getting
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
arrested and while this wouldn't stop
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
everybody from getting arrested at least
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
it would stop a lot of people from
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
getting I like that idea
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
right so that would not come to us
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's not ours no but I can take it out
 
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
of this bill we can take it all
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
completely out of this bill no I think
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
no I wanted to take it out of the spill
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
and keep it
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
in front of us now no we we would it
 
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
would it goes to criminal justice it's
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
it's our it's not our issue
 
01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.250 align:start position:0%
it's our it's not our issue
Sean

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
Sean
 
01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.810 align:start position:0%
Sean
so

01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
if we were to take that portion out of
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bill I think
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
we need to legalize cannabis because if
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
you were to purchase cannabis at the
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
stores without eliminating the
 
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
prohibition of cannabis everybody who
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
were to purchase it at a agency store
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
would immediately commit the crime of
 
01:10:14.699 --> 01:10:15.830 align:start position:0%
would immediately commit the crime of
possession

01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
possession
 
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
we can't just pass the legalization of
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
this committee because we're not Crim J
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
however it sounds like an excellent
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment if somebody wanted to
 
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
bring that floor Amendment uh at the
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
next session and I'd be happy to
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor that with somebody if
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to bring that floor
 
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.270 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to bring that floor
Amendment

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.290 align:start position:0%
Amendment
um

01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
why I think we can why I think there is
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
that limit up to four four ounces is
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
that we actually Place limits on
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
possession of a lot of controlled
 
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
substances and I think this would be one
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
example of a narcotic controlled
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
substance whether you think that
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
classification is legitimate or not
 
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
um I think is questionable but we do
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
place that limit on a lot of different
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
substances and so that this is just
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
another example of that granted you know
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
alcohol arguably is worse than cannabis
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
we don't place a limit on that but
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
there are arbitrary limits all over the
 
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
place in the law this is just another
 
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
one of those and I think that we're
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
probably going down a sinkhole that we
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to go down because we've now
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
spent 10 minutes arguing about four
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
ounces and we probably could spend
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
another hour doing that uh but if
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to do a floor Amendment
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
with me I'd be happy to do that but this
 
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
is not the committee to start doing
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
criminal justice because then we're
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to become the criminal justice uh
 
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and Commerce
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
Committee and I think we have too much
 
01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:30.620 align:start position:0%
work to do as it is
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so I do have the the record
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
here uh so the uh the bill to
 
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
decriminalize marijuana uh was
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
originally voted out of the committee as
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh in expedient to legislate 11 to 9.
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
they were overturned on the house floor
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
210 to 160 voted to turn down that
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
motion uh the pending motion of ought to
 
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
pass did pass by Voice vote so we can
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
say 210 want to decriminalization and
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
160 didn't and when it got over to the
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
Senate the senate committee uh reported
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
inexperience a legislate and Senator
 
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
Gannon uh last Thursday the 18th moved
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
to laying on the table and roll call
 
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
vote unanimousness 24 to zip
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
decriminalization was laid on the table
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
what was the bill number on that
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
so I guess let's just put that aside as
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
a as a sidebar of discussion so what I'm
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
hearing is that this committee feels
 
01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:49.460 align:start position:0%
this bill is not ready for prime time
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
and this amendment and that we so when
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
we go into exact session in 15 minutes
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
that uh we will not discuss this
 
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
amendment whatsoever we will just simply
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
take up uh the original underlying bill
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
so because this is just an amendment
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
so when we get into our executive
 
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
session 15 minutes from now
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock uh we will simply vote uh to
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh send Senate Bill 98 unamended to the
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
house floor will we make any effort to
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
fix this so This effort this will be
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
done uh basically where as you'll
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
remember uh we we have a retained bill
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
that is very similar language concept so
 
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
we will then work on that bill
 
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:51.020 align:start position:0%
and and uh and obviously we'll try to
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
diligently solve the ATC problems but
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there will be members who
 
01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:01.580 align:start position:0%
will won't vote for that anyways and
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's you're entitled to your opinion
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
but so but it does look like it's it was
 
01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
it was close that that people would want
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
to go with that but at this moment it if
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
we were to follow our committee rules I
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
would say that even we get down to
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill if it's going to be 10 10
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
come October then we will in a room
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs so if some of us
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
had come forward with a new amendment to
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
SB 98 that essentially kept only the
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
parts that said Thou shalt not be
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
arrested for cannabis
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
this committee would not have taken that
 
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.209 align:start position:0%
this committee would not have taken that
up

01:14:49.209 --> 01:14:49.219 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's it interestingly
 
01:14:52.199 --> 01:14:52.850 align:start position:0%
that's it interestingly
um

01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
we could take that up if you were just
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
to remove everything else and take that
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
issue uh and what would happen is if we
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
had passed that bill okay it would go on
 
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
to the house floor in January
 
01:15:10.689 --> 01:15:10.699 align:start position:0%
and at that point the speaker will then
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
rule that the bill goes on to criminal
 
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
justice after it leaves this committee
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I would venture to say the criminal
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
justice committee vote will be in
 
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate 11 to 9 and then
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
we will overturn it on the house floor
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
and pass it and we'll send it over to
 
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the odds are the Senate
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
will kill it
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
but we could not take it up so that it
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
could be brought forward to session this
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
June if you want to
 
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
do a floor Amendment and I I think
 
01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative said he'll help you with
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing stopping you guys
 
01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.810 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing stopping you guys
to

01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:49.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
uh take up any bill or if you want to
 
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
take up this one then we can leave it on
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
the regular calendar rather than put on
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar and then uh offer
 
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
up that Amendment and try again this
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
year but I would say you're probably not
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to be too successful when it gets
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate side
 
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
so you're suggesting that the best thing
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
to do is to continue working on HB 544
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
that was the other house bill
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
eaten belt yeah but in terms of taking
 
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
it out of Eaton's build which I assume
 
01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's in there I don't I don't have it in
 
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
front of me I assume it's in there we
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
can certainly remove it completely from
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
but that will be the first reason why
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
someone will use why they would vote
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
against it that say is great you make it
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
illegal to sell marijuana but you can't
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
carry it you can't have it I wasn't
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting to remove it and get rid of
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
it I'm suggesting remove it keep it and
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
get rid of everything else
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
so people could go and buy marijuana in
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts come back to New Hampshire
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's a lot of people
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
who are really excited about that
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
concept but I think that if you believe
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
in it you're absolutely have every
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that but I I don't
 
01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
think you're going to get that vote out
 
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
of this committee because that's just
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
not our Billy whack I mean that's not
 
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
that's this bill is not here because of
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative Bros
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
I would just say the one reason that the
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment might be a good idea
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that it's going to fail
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
is to remind people
 
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
um we're
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
why these bills are dying and to
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
remember that in 2024.
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
I know don't look at me that way well
 
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
I'm saying the bill is dying here
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
because we can agree on whether we want
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
to have the Liquor Commission have
 
01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:49.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
it died in the Senate we had a bill that
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
we all agreed on here
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
right so that's not that's not on us I
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
think I mean I don't know what I think
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
about that strategy but I get the point
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
that right what people are going to say
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
is he you heard the governor was all set
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
and why didn't you guys why didn't you
 
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
guys come forward with what the governor
 
01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.030 align:start position:0%
guys come forward with what the governor
wanted

01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:09.659 align:start position:0%
no because it's
 
01:18:09.659 --> 01:18:10.970 align:start position:0%
no because it's
well

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:12.659 align:start position:0%
we can go down that road if you want I
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
don't know like I keep hearing my name I
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
mean I can't you know all week my name
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
is popping up about this but so but in
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
any rate
 
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
yes Philip
 
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
are there any uh very basic anxious uh
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
bills coming up on the consent calendar
 
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
that you know of that would be ripe to
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
be pulled off the consent calendar say
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
to have a floor amendment to pull the
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
food right onto them
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh the calendar hasn't come out yet well
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
anything that we sent up on consent uh
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh well like I said we had
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
we had that other liquor bill which we
 
01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
end up retaining
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
and so I mean you know in terms of
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
you're trying to find something to
 
01:18:54.239 --> 01:18:55.430 align:start position:0%
you're trying to find something to
remain

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
remain
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
um only the Senate I mean the only thing
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
you can add on the house side at this
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
point would be the language of three
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so because it passed the house
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
it has germanness so you could actually
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
attach that to any bill it doesn't
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
matter what bill it is you can attach
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
that to a bill
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:19:30.659 --> 01:19:32.450 align:start position:0%
and and
um

01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
but you do risk that the underlying Bill
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
might might die well if I'm looking for
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
something pretty anxious that if it were
 
01:19:38.699 --> 01:19:39.410 align:start position:0%
something pretty anxious that if it were
to

01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
if it were to die if it wouldn't be the
 
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
end of the it wouldn't be the end you
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
would sometimes pick up one that it
 
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
would yeah it's no big deal and that
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why I chose this bill
 
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
to be the one we we took this issue up
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
on because you know
 
01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not it's not an
 
01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
earth-shaking this is a pretty inside
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
baseball type bill
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Waltz
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
maybe this keeps dying because uh
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
contrary to what my colleagues say the
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire do not want
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
this to become New Hampshire to become
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine or Vermont
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I wish I had my pearls on so I could
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
clutch them while saying this but
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm sure that everyone that I've
 
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
talked to emailed spoken to reached out
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
to me thanking me for fighting this is
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely against the legalization of a
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
narcotic drug in New Hampshire no matter
 
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
how it's put in any bill in any form
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's sold by New Hampshire state
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
liquor stores or agencies or atcs so I
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
just thought I'd make that clear thank
 
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.570 align:start position:0%
just thought I'd make that clear thank
you

01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
just question of germaneness if there
 
01:20:59.570 --> 01:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
was a floor Amendment if yeah just speak
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
to the Mike listener if there is a floor
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
so yeah the other bill is 360. so we can
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
attach that as a floor Amendment and it
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be Jermaine because it passed the
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
house but the language in this amendment
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
we hadn't we had a public hearing
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
a non-germaine public hearing correct
 
01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
and so a subset of this language would
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
still be
 
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
attachable to SB 98 because we had that
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing exactly no it's not about
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
public hearing it after you it's about
 
01:21:31.729 --> 01:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
um adding a non-domain amendment to a
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
bill right so yes theoretically
 
01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.430 align:start position:0%
bill right so yes theoretically
um

01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
it had to be a bill that passed the
 
01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:41.219 align:start position:0%
house already I'm talking about the
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
language in Amendment 2014. right now
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
what you were saying is if it's already
 
01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
been World Germans since Senate Bill 98
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
could we could we could do that right
 
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.729 align:start position:0%
could we could we could do that right
now

01:21:52.729 --> 01:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
we could add that line we could add five
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
344 to to to uh to 198 or yes you were
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
right I I would say I would and again
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes Paul Smith's can
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
surprised at me but because we had a
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
non-germaining in that language was in
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
the original Amendment
 
01:22:14.689 --> 01:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
that if we had this Senate Bill 98 ought
 
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
to pass it would be open to Amendment
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
and then you could bring in that
 
01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:24.620 align:start position:0%
amendment that 344 Amendment
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
360. 360 Amendment yes so 360 could be
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
added to this bill
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
which is what I guess but you were
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
looking for representative Gibbs
 
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.179 --> 01:22:43.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment to Senate bill 98. I I
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
just wanted to to follow up
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
um with rep what representative Walsh
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
says about marijuana being
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
um a narcotic I think there's I'm just
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
skimming through there's a lot of
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
organizations that just would disagree
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
with you um including the United Nations
 
01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
office on drugs and crime the National
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
Institute of Health and many others so
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:18.860 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman okay
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
we're almost to the exact session so let
 
01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
me just finish up a little housekeeping
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
here Mr chairman yes uh excuse me uh may
 
01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
I also follow up uh very briefly
 
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
of course thank you
 
01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.070 align:start position:0%
of course thank you
um

01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
my apologies to representative Walsh
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
um uh the last time I spoke smoked
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
marijuana was 51 years ago
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
um I can say that as a hospital patient
 
01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:55.340 align:start position:0%
I have occasionally been prescribed
 
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
narcotic drugs
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
um and I remember vividly the effect of
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
those and I can tell you that from
 
01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
personal experience that the effect of
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
marijuana and the effect of uh narcotic
 
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
drugs uh that I took by prescription
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
um have absolutely no resemblance
 
01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:23.870 align:start position:0%
um have absolutely no resemblance
whatsoever

01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
everybody else all right
 
01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:30.260 align:start position:0%
okay uh so right now the
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh has will uh let's say
 
01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.030 align:start position:0%
