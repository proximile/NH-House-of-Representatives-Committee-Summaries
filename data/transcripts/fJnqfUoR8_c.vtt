complex the audit is currently staffed
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
with five Auditors we're more than
 
00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
halfway through
 
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
fieldwork we're drafting observations
 
00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 align:start position:0%
for completed portions of our work
 
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 align:start position:0%

students who are
 
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
that the students may qualify for on
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%

those uh these are the same categories
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
that uh public education students can

that are allowed under the program on
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
pages two to three and this is the exact
 
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
law that is copied and pasted in
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
here we go on to discuss the scholarship
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
organization that has contracted with to
 
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
program the bullets below the that
 
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph discuss the payment system
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
that they have established as the
 
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.629 align:start position:0%
that they have established as the
scholarship

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
organization on page four we discussed
 
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
the phase out grants those are entirely
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
handled by the Department of Education
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the scholarship organization does
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
grants bottom of page four we discuss
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
the Department's program oversight of
 
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
the educ education Freedom account
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
program we have background on the EFA
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
administrator position in there uh he is
 
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
majority he's mainly responsible for the
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
oversight of the program um the position
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't immediately established when the
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
EFA program went into effect so there's
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit of delay on the
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
EFA below that we discussed the audit
 
00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
scope we lead in with the statutory
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
language that requires the audit
 
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
and our scope question would be how
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
effectively did nhed oversee the EFA
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
program during State fiscal years 2022
 
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
program during State fiscal years 2022
through

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
2024 we have a pretty detailed bolded
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
list of our objectives and some of the
 
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
objectives our audit period will be
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
State fiscal years 2022 through 2024
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
however we may have to look at a time
 
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
period outside of the audit period in
 
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
order to to understand relevant matters
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
within the audit period so it's not
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
completely limited to 2022 through
 
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
2024 as of today we expect to have a
 
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
2025 we summarize the scope limitations
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
six the scope limitations have not
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
changed since our March 18th LPA
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
meeting uh there is a part of that first
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph is certain certain documents
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
that we will not be able to possess in
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
we will not able to obtain that are in
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
the possession of the scholarship
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
organization we have spoken to the
 
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
department and uh it will be up to their
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
discretion to request documents from the
 
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
discretion to request documents from the
scholarship

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
organization and the last paragraph is
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
the Department's position on the
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
authority to audit the scholarship
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
organization which was also discussed at
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
the March 18th
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%

the law and um you know so the Doe's
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
depends on what we're looking at the
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
details as far as we can tell the
 
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
details of what we discussed at the
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
March 18th meeting are largely
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
unchanged so anything that the
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
department has done for its oversight we
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
won't be able to independently verify by
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
going to the scholarship organization to
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
obtain those similar materials or assess
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
the uh potential risks that we would
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
normally do in a regular audit we can
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
identify potential risks but in unless
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
we go into the scholarship organization
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
and obtain Source P documents we won't
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
risk um
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
so considering what the uh requirement
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
was in the law that required the audit
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
um sort of the Doe's sort of
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
unwillingness to um you know give access
 
00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
or even request um access from the
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to that primary
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
program data do you feel like the LBA is
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
sort of not able to comply with the law
 
00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
uh because of that limitation we're
 
00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:05.959 align:start position:0%
we're going to comply with the law in
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
the extent that we can once we publish a
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
report we do put scope limitations in
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
the report of the details of what
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
stopped us from going through the full
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
scope of what we usually audit in a
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
program so we will be able to fulfill
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
the statutory requirement I think we
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
just won't get as far as we do in our
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
normal audits follow up follow up so on
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
page six when you're talking and thank
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
you for identifying these limitations I
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
think that's really helpful for us on
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
page six um where you talk about the
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
scope limitations halfway through that
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph you uh say in the in the scope
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh limitations quote preliminary
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with NHD indicate most
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
documents pertaining to the EFA program
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
are solely in the possession of uh
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
CSF um and then uh give some examples
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then lastly that department of
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
education does not currently possess
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
documents associated with initial EFA
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
applications documents used for
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
determining eligibility for
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and annually
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
verifying residency or specific items
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
purchased by each student with the EFA
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
fund so can you expand on you know I
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
understand the Department's position
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
that um the audit can only uh look the
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
Auditors can only look at what the
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has it's clear
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
what they have and and what they do have
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
and what they don't have can you um
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
expand on sort of your conversation
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
about the Department's willingness
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
Department of education's willingness to
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
you know directly request what is
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
necessary to complete the audit sure so
 
00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is we we're developing our
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
audit plan at this point and we are
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
going to go forward with our plan is if
 
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
we did have full access to the
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
documentation and as we progress with
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
that audit plan we still do not know
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
what exactly the department has versus
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
what the scholarship organization has so
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
we will still request all the
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
documentation you would need and then
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have to rely the department to let
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
us know what is unavailable and go
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
forward from there great and last
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
question has the Department of Education
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
indicated whether be they'd be willing
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
to request that information that you're
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
going to give you're going to request it
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be their discretion if it
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
directly impacts their oversight
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
responsibilities or something that we
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
identify in laws rules or the contract
 
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
that they should have they have stated
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
they're willing to reach out to the
 
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship Organization for those items
 
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
scholarship Organization for those items
thank

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
you brother
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Walmer so
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
recently there was a a compliance report
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
that came forth and um it was looking at
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
a very small number of students in the
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
um in the program I'm wondering how will
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
the lb's Auditors use that information
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
in this audit yeah we just received that
 
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
as well uh this past Friday so we
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten a chance to look over
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
everything we are reviewing it to
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
determine what we can work off to
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
independently verify information uh any
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
work papers that the department used
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
they've been willing that they've
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
retained from that they've been willing
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
to share those with us so we will get
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
access to those um as far as our audit
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
work it will not directly impact what we
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
have planned um because it's the
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
Department's work and they had access
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
directly so we won't be able to
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
independently verify what they did but
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
it is a good starting point in the types
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:35.759 align:start position:0%
identified one more question so I guess
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying will you do you
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate having any interviews or
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
conversations with the scholarship
 
00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
organization it is our understanding
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
that we will not have access to the
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
staff thank
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes sen n thank you but to be
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
clear the Department of Education has
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
said they cooperate as you're reviewing
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
their oversight responsibility and how
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
they've implemented oversight over the
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh child scholarship fund and are
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
willing to provide any documentation to
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
show what policies procedures and rules
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
they have that have been put into place
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
including documentation where they've
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
executed oversight over that and
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
validated that oversight correct thank
 
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
you I have a question um so I think I
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
heard you say you just won't have access
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
to information to validate the
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
Department's responses so I'm trying to
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
think of the usual performance audits I
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
look at and there might be a I remember
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
one from lottery for example that said
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
they weren't locking the drawing room
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
door um it was some years ago
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
and so you would have had a way to
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
validate whether they were or were not
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
blocking the room where they drew the
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
the tickets but in
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
so you can look at their procedures and
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
policies for oversight but you won't be
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
verify that they were getting the
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
information to comply with those
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
policies correct it appears that we
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
won't be able to verify their practice
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
conforms to their policies and
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
procedures so we'll take their word for
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
it we will report what the department
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
reports but that would be one of the
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
areas but we know it a goal
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
implementation that we were unable to
 
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.910 align:start position:0%
implementation that we were unable to
independently

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
independently
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
verify so what kind
 
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.829 align:start position:0%
verify so what kind
of

00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:52.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
observations would you be able to
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
report to the legislature
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
I believe we'll be able like I said to
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
go through the requirements in state law
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we will be able to identify areas of
 
00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
risk that the department should be
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
looking at we will not be able to assess
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
the extent of that risk that exists so
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
we can point out areas that the
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
department should be monitoring but
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
currently is not or there are no
 
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
controls or we have concerns about um we
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
will gather as much evidence as we can
 
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
to support those and uh just like I said
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
in Normal audit we would be able to do
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
some kind of sample at the source and
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
put numbers in place of how big that
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
risk is so if just I guess one more
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
question the audit gets to
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
respond the AUD being the department not
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
yes yeah they will respond to the uh
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
observations correct they have to
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
respond they I don't know anybody who
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
has not provided responses uh I believe
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
they have to have an opportunity to
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
respond they do not have to put
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
responses in the
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
report so we don't know if they'll
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
respond I we've had a few audits with
 
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
them so far and they've never not
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
responded so I'd be surprised if they
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
did not okay yeah
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
great Senor with me and then thank you
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair and and thank you for going
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
through this with us again it it does
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
feel like not much has changed since
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
March and at that meeting a number of
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee all of
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
whom are legislators you know this is a
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
bipartisan committee expressed concerns
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
that you know our job as elected
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
officials as legislators uh and more
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
specifically this committee's job is to
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that public dollars are being
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
used appropriately and in this case I
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify this is a situation
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
where Millions upon millions of public
 
00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.310 align:start position:0%
where Millions upon millions of public
dollars

00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
are being put into a program operated by
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
a private
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
organization and due to the Department
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
of education's unwillingness to allow
 
00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:10.990 align:start position:0%
of education's unwillingness to allow
the

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
legislative uh the legis you know the
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
LBA to go in and audit directly this
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
organization that is
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
utilizing and giving
 
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
out uh public dollars um you know do you
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
have concerns that you know we're being
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh our role as um you know the public
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
puts trust in us to make sure that
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
public dollars are being used
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately do you have any concerns
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
um based on the way that this has
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
proceeded that we're not going to be
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
able to to do that so far the we're
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
working with the department and doing
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
what we're statut required to do I think
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
after the report comes out or if the
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
oversight committee or the legislators
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
see their concerns that they may have
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
it's their authority to be able to put
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
something in place for that um I believe
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
we're did you speak into the sorry P
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
always afraid I'm too close to it um I
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
was just saying that after this we will
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
be able to fulfill the statutory
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
obligations that are given to us and we
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
will provide a report if there are
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
remaining concerns when the report comes
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
out it pretty much is the legislator's
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
authority to take extra steps to address
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
those things so from our end there
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
aren't any preliminary concerns and we
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't influence policy directly so once
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
you have the report I think you'll have
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
a better idea of those concerns
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang and then r gber i I just
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
want to be careful in our in our um
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
Trail of the Department of Education
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
right I mean I think the last sentence
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
on page seven uh really States what's
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
going on in in the ability of data and
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
no amount of laws that we pass can that
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
inv invalidate another law so it's clear
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
here it says in addition to the
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the Attorney
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
General State's lawyers represent his
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the state standard
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
contract which is required to be used by
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
All State agencies when Contracting
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
Services does not consider the data
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
collected or generated by a contractor
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
to be the property of the state doesn't
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
give us the right to override that law
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
if we pass another law right so we'd
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
have to deal with how the state
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
contracts are written to deal with
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
contract law but I want to be clear that
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
if the agency if the Department of
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
Education did oversight you have a list
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
of things on page six and one of which
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
is identifying recovering and eligible
 
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:26.919 align:start position:0%
EFA dispersements topay to students
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
ensuring phase out grants or paid to
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
school districts appropriately uh
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
ensuring that students receive the
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
correct amount if the agency performed
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
oversight activity and collected data to
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
validate that they were doing what they
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
were supposed to do you all have access
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
to that data corre so so again I I want
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
to be careful not portraying Department
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
of Education it's not cooperating
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
they're cooperating within the terms of
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
the law that they're allowed to
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
cooperate is even identified by the
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
Attorney General so and I think you'll
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
be able to do your report based on that
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
and if we need to adjust the contract to
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
not to deal with our maybe bad language
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
in our contract law that we can deal
 
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.269 align:start position:0%
in our contract law that we can deal
with

00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
that representative Weber and then
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you madam chair I'd like
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
to ask how many people and how much
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
effort are we putting in in other words
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
how many people for how many weeks is
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
this audit going to take or is it
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
estimated to take our current team is
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
myself V skids and one staff auditor so
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
three of us uh with the our anticipation
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
is to get it to fiscal spring of
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
2025 depending we're finishing the audit
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
plan within the next couple months once
 
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
the audit plan is finished we'll have a
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
better idea of what to expect for a date
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
weer I think that my question was really
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat on the same lines as Senator
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
Langs of uh just
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
that seems to me there two issues here
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
one is tax dollars and but that's almost
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
more of a financial audit than a
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
performance audit and that what you so
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
what you're going to be looking at if
 
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
I'm correct is the actual oversight
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
provided by the Department of
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
Education and what procedures and
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
practice is they are using to comply
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
with their statutory duty to oversee the
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
program is that correct y okay thank you
 
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.669 align:start position:0%
program is that correct y okay thank you
representative

00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
wner thank
 
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
you the scholarship organization is a
 
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
you the scholarship organization is a
nonprofit

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
organization and is there a um fiscal
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
audit that's available because that
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
organization as a nonprofit would have
 
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
have to be doing regular audits they do
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
receive financial audits annually and
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
those are publicly posted and have been
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
provided okay and those would be
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
something that you would have access to
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
and you would look at yes during this
 
00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:15.390 align:start position:0%
and you would look at yes during this
thank

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
you wait but but I have
 
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.470 align:start position:0%
you wait but but I have
okay

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
so question yes representative Earth uh
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so can you speak
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
to the other special education audit
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
that you're doing with the Department of
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
Education and whether or not you the
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
audit Auditors have been able to go to
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
the local school districts kind of
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
analogous to the CSF Foundation to
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
determine whether in fact they are
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
following the law that you are uh
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
reporting on with regard to the
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
Education I can't speak to the special
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
education audit if you want to ask about
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
local school districts I believe Jay has
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
a little more information
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
on what was decided for going to the
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
audit hello my name is Jay Henry I'm the
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
performance audit supervisor for the LBA
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
audit division um with the special ed
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
audit the big special ed audit um which
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
um Chris has talked about we're talking
 
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to be big 50 observations it
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
really that is focused just on the
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
department and it is not going out to
 
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.630 align:start position:0%
department and it is not going out to
audit

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
audit
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
locals um I I think we've talked about
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
this before it's um looking at the
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
program we're sort of better to look at
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
the state first because they're the ones
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
setting up the program running the
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
program and should be managing the
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
program and if there's if we have issues
 
00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
with what the state is doing you know um
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
imagine you know what's happening at the
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
locals you know they're just reacting to
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
what the state's doing you know I think
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
the if if the legislature wanted maybe
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
after this audit to do more at the local
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
level that that might be good but I
 
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
think there'd be have to be a lot of
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
changes at the at the at the uh state
 
00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:24.149 align:start position:0%
changes at the at the at the uh state
level

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
first followup yes follow so so despite
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
the fact that the committee when they
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
originally requested that audit a couple
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
years ago when I was initially on this
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee specifically requesting that
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
the local districts be audited because
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
they were the source of the problem that
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
the parents were reporting the uh
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
performance AUD committee chose not to
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
address that correct well if I remember
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
the scope statement itself itself uh
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
that they agreed on this this committee
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
it was more focused at the the state
 
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.269 align:start position:0%
it was more focused at the the state
level

00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
followup I understand that but the
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
initial request by the chairman at that
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
time was broader than the scope
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
statement that you put forward once that
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
chairman was no longer the
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
chairman if I remember that it it sort
 
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
of grew that this whole topic it started
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
out um if I Senator Reagan was the the
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
chair of a special committee he was also
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
the chair of this this committee and it
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
started off with the dispute resolution
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
was the first thing that
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
he wanted us to do and we actually did
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
that audit Paige was the in charge of
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
that audit and but then as they kept
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
talking about special
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
education it grew as far as the the
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
things they wanted us to look at so
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's how we came and the locals were
 
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
discussed but I think it was determined
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know we really got to look at the
 
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
first um
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl thank you I figured I
 
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:05.519 align:start position:0%
might as well chime in everyone
 
00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:07.389 align:start position:0%
might as well chime in everyone
else

00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
so the um the issue here seems to be
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
that this data that some of the data is
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
owned by an independent contractor and
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
not by the state is have have you run
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
into this issue previously in audits
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
that you've tried to do and and if so
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
how have you worked through it
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's more finan some of the financial
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
audits yeah I
 
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
mean I don't recall ever running into um
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
an issue of this magnitude I mean we do
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
audit departments that have contracts um
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
with third parties um but in this
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
situation because the scholarship
 
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
organization essentially
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
runs um most of the program program um
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
it it is different and um you know we
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
have worked
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
through minor scope limitations before
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
and we've always been able to come to an
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
agreement and um obtain the records that
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
we need to obtain in order to perform
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
the audit um this is a little different
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
with the program being established in
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
the chapter law and uh directing us to
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
do an audit through the chapter law
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
versus you you know this committee
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
directing us to do an audit that is not
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
established in the chapter law so it is
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit different oh yes F so is
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
there a process where the contractor
 
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
themselves can be audited who who would
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
that I mean that would be an an
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
independent uh CPA firm or another um
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
audit firm we historically have not
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
audited entities that are not State
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
agencies thank you
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
okay except we do have in our statute
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's a weird sort of provision about
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
being able to uh look at non-state
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
entities I think there it's like up to F
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
five over a fiveyear period something
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
like that with the idea that I think
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
they knew State funds are going down you
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
know to the local level um and we we
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
have looked at other programs like the
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
the cap programs you know money from the
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
state will go to these uh cap programs
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
to do various uh functions for the state
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
or the or the federal government you
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
know some of the federal funds go down
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
and we have been able to audit you know
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
those programs or receive information
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
from those programs but it also may be
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
that their contracts that they have with
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
the state are stronger or have have
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
language that allow allow the department
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
to that departments that have the those
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
contracts you know access to
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
data okay thank you so we've all seen
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
the contract for this program and it
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
states pretty clearly that all that data
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
belongs to this
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
state did the Attorney General oppose
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
the contract when it came before the
 
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.190 align:start position:0%
the contract when it came before the
executive

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
councel not to my knowledge not to our
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge no so
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
they were okay with the fact that well I
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
think they review like in Medicaid the
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
state really
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
owns all the data even though most of
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is managed by private
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
entities this is not unique the state
 
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
owns the data
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
contract yeah to me it's an
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the state contract and
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
we had our initial view of it we thought
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
it would look oh boy this they can ask
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
for all this data if they ask for it we
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
can look at it we can audit it um they
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
saw it as know the program set up to be
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
away from the state run by run by the uh
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh um scholarship program and you know
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
there was sort of a separation there and
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
so you know we're we're abiding by sort
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
of their interpretation of how the the
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
contract in the law it is and I think
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
they're still going to get you're still
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
going to get a good audit out of it it
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
just won't be as thorough as is where
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
normally would have yeah Senator
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
Whitney um thank you madam chair you
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
know you indicated that you know it's
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
fairly unusual for this nonprofit
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
private entity to you know run a state
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
funded program so you know so deeply so
 
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
the depth of how much um you know how
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
little involvement the doe had has so
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
essentially that means that the doe has
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
delegated you know pretty much all of
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
its authority to the to this nonprofit
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
organization and and that to me has
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
resulted in a you know coupled with
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
their uh as you said the Doe's
 
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the contract that has
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
resulted in a very very troubling lack
 
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:23.720 align:start position:0%
of transparency for a significant amount
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
of State dollars um it does the LBA so
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
my question is does the LBA have uh the
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
capacity or would you need something
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
additional from this committee um
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
regarding you know sort of uh maybe the
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
legislature's own interpretation uh of
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
the contract and what you know the doe
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
is obligated to request or not
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
request because I I guess you know my
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that and I and I
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
understand why you are you are relying
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
on the Department of Education
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
interpretation and but that's the
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
executive branch we're the legislative
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
branch and so I'm wondering if you know
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some additional uh
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
review of
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
this yeah I don't I don't think that's
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
the auditive role I mean that's more of
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
a legislative function
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
um again if if
 
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
the this
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
committee wanted a a different
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
audit you know we're doing a chapter law
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
audit this committee could come up with
 
00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
its own audit its own
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
scope um and if they wanted I guess to
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
expand what we're doing uh but you still
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
may run
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
into problems of
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
interpretation it gets messy and that's
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
you know that's why we're sort of we
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
don't have we just we can do what we can
 
00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:53.079 align:start position:0%
do but we can't push you know sort of
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
pass that well to follow up on that
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
you've said this a would be available in
 
00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.950 align:start position:0%
you've said this a would be available in
this

00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
spring um fall goes well budget
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
season so do you have any sense of
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
whether it will be available during the
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
house phase or the Senate phase or not
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
before the budget is
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
completed I think we have to Once once
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
you decide what the scope of the audit
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
is so whether you approve it as written
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
or if you you change the scope that
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
would affect how long it takes and on
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
but once that's done we we we write our
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
audit plan and that's really where we
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
try to get a good estimate of when we
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
think we're going to get this done if
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
everything runs smoothly uh so right now
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
we're just sort of you know we're
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
estimating spring of 2025 and I don't
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's a broad time I know that
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
because we're not quite sure how long
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to take and it's also the
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
interaction we have with the Department
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
once we give them observations and
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
right now we have no clue if it's going
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
to be one or 20 observations you know we
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
could and the more observations the more
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
time it takes for us to write the more
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
time it takes for them to respond um you
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
know it's like special ed the reason why
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
that one's taking so long and that's big
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
you've told us that's going to be like
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
this yeah and also we should note that
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
spring in New Hampshire lasts for about
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
three days now so I mean you're probably
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
going to miss the Spring wind know
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
should should be mud season right that
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
that would be great okay mud season
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
Senator I move we approve the scope and
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to speak to my motion is there
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
a second second by representative Weber
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
so again I I think until we deal with
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
the contract law conflict I think this
 
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
is the oversight which is a great thing
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
to look at see they have a respons the
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has a
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility oversight are they
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
performing their oversight and if they
 
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
have performed their oversight Did they
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
perform it properly I think is the
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do and I think it's
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
a pretty clean clean vote representative
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
Weber did you want to speak to your
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
comments ready for a vote the motion is
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
to approve the scope
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
statement on uh Doe's oversight of the
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
EFA program all in favor say I I
 
00:37:28.359 --> 00:37:29.349 align:start position:0%
EFA program all in favor say I I
any

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
opposed the motion is adopted
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
yes the next one let me just announce
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
now that I am not going to be voting on
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
this next one and I'll explain why
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
issue okay so on to dhs's out ofate
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
placements this audit was to evaluate
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
the interplay between the different
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
agencies and bureaus within the
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
in certifying out of state juvenile
 
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.870 align:start position:0%
in certifying out of state juvenile
residential

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
residential
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
facilities we scheduled an entrance
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
conference for July
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
31st uh soon after that during the
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
planning for the audit we came across a
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
federal lawsuit against the governor and
 
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS officials over the placement of
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
foster care children in residential
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
facilities uh while it appears the
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuit doesn't specifically relate to
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
the two juveniles who were placed in
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
Tennessee uh there could be some
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
overlap uh a similar issue happened a
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
few years ago uh with our performance
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
audit of uh DHHS is Bureau of elderly
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
and adult services and that audit is
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
still pending now uh government auditing
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
standards require us to evaluate the
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
effects of legal proceedings on an audit
 
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
so after discussing the matter with DHHS
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
we and DHHS officials believe the audit
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
could interfere with the lawsuit and
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
vice versa the lawsuit could interfere
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
audit because of the lawsuit we
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
cancelled the entrance conference and
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
we're suggesting that might be best to
 
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:31.640 align:start position:0%
suspend the audit um of out ofate
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
placements until the legal proceedings
 
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
have concluded so uh we're looking for a
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
vote on this now um unless the committee
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
would first like to hear from somebody
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
Services um who could provide some more
 
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
information on how the issue in the
 
00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
lawsuit could intersect with the audit
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay and so the rest of my explanation
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
is that I have a family member who's in
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
involved with the foster care laws so I
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
will not be voting on this would the
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee like to hear from
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
DHHS Madam chair I guess I I'm okay with
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
the idea this is a past practice of the
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
AG of us obviously so I don't know that
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
we need to hear from anybody else I
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
think we continue to pass
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
practice Senator Whitney I I would agree
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the lawsuit and also uh the
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
governor just last Friday signed SB b417
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
which directly relates to the
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
Department's placement of children um
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
out of out of state and in state so um
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
that law needs to be implemented too so
 
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
I would agree to the suspension
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
so move to suspend is there a second
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
second second hit by Senator Pearl any
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion and I will not be
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
voting all in favor say I I any
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
opposed and one absten
 
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.550 align:start position:0%
opposed and one absten
thank

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
you okay moving on to the doorway
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
program we've not started this audit yet
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
but uh we intend to start in the next
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
month or so as soon as staff is
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
available to uh begin that
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
audit and uh now we can move on to
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
agenda item number three if that's okay
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
sure so there are three potential audit
 
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
topics on the list one of which is
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
currently suspended as I mentioned that
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
was for
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
beas are there any other topics that
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
you'd like to add to the
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
discuss any
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
thoughts didn't we hear some suggestion
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
and about something out of environmental
 
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
services that we decided not to go
 
00:41:58.359 --> 00:42:01.109 align:start position:0%
services that we decided not to go
forward

00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
that do you remember you do yeah so
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
again I think this had to do with their
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
appeals process is what we were talking
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
about and the idea of again but they've
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
they're one of the few that actually
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
have moved the appeals process outside
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
their agencies to the Attorney General's
 
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
office where a lot of agencies do the
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
appeals process within like save does
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
their own appeals process within the
 
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
department of safety and so um I think
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
we decided that because that's already
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
been kind of the model I think maybe
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
going forward we want to look at um
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
there was no need to do the audit of
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
their appeals
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
process yes
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
represent the other one that we
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
suspended last time along with the one
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
that uh was just described was the
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
public access to bodies of water and we
 
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
we suspended both of those from
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
consideration they've been sort of
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
hanging out there for a while and we
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
simply decided to take them
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
off so there are a couple other but that
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
reflected in the minutes yeah there's a
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
couple of items on this list
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS contract Bureau and
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
BDS um
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
including possibly reviewing system
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
redesign and effects on building and
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
services and or housing practices any
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts Senator with yeah on
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
the ladder I think we're still awaiting
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
a report is that correct on the system
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
BDS I am not sure where that system
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
redesign stands they started it they
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
stopped it okay I I don't actually
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
know where it is but um
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
there were there was Federal
 
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.430 align:start position:0%
there were there was Federal
litigation

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
again um so maybe that's not a great
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
management I just I'll just mention I
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
think contract management uh
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative Wier was one of his
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
topics and then at the next meeting
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
Department came in Department officials
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
and they had actually had developed a
 
00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
contract management system they there
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
was a handout and they so you know it
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
was something that I don't think
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
repesent wild knew about initially um I
 
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:40.559 align:start position:0%
mean it's something that can be audited
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
but uh I think we were I was surprised
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
that they had actually come up with the
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know come up with a system which
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
would probably we'll say Auditors would
 
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
like you
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
know so we don't need that one we don't
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
need an audit right now but we like to
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
have some ready to go I mean as you can
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
tell we've got some audits that are
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing we're talking about the spring I
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
in fact that's probably the earliest
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
that the next um audit topic after we
 
00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
start the doorways a it so we don't have
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
to have one today but we we're always
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
looking for something to put on the list
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
so you guys can consider it um I think
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
we're also coming up to the end of uh
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
the session or there'll be a new
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
committee I in
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
January so whether you want to leave
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
leave a clean slate or have some
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
stuff sort of for us to do you know
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
before you before this committee you
 
00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:46.559 align:start position:0%
know um dissolves I guess so are you
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to have anything to bring us back
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
before organization day uh I think the
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
only one that might be be the doorways
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh scope statement if we can get that
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
done I'll say December but you know it
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
all depends on when they start the work
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
and uh how how big the scope is and
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
everything representative Weber and then
 
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.510 align:start position:0%
everything representative Weber and then
Senator

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
Lan that was I think you've just
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
answered most of my question but um
 
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
given that the doorways is already in
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
the pipeline um it would perhaps I I
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's at all possible for
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
for that to
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
happen before December 5th when
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
everything changes or December whatever
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
it is this year it it will start before
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
like we we're planning on starting it um
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
but next month my my point is that if we
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
were to have a vote on a scope statement
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to have it in
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
November so we could vote on it end of
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
November which is always problematical
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
anyway because then we have organiz
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
day and reorganization and you're going
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
to have to wait for the appointees yeah
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that takes and that takes some time
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
because um you know leaders from both
 
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
parties have to be elected and
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
then you know it it
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
just well that may motivate us get it
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
done that was my precise point if if
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
there was any way of getting of focusing
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
on getting that done so that then you
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
have that on your plate ready uh ready
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
to work on and then in January you know
 
00:47:35.549 --> 00:47:35.559 align:start position:0%
we will be reconstituted and and um
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
ready to start work on whatever comes
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
next but it sounds to me like you have a
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
fair amount on your plate
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
anyway yes but we we'll have some people
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
freed up to to start right the doorway
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
one okay Senator L that was a similar
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
point I was saying and we can use
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
November to bring in topics at that
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
point to kind of queue up for the next
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee that comes on board here's the
 
00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.589 align:start position:0%
committee that comes on board here's the
ideas

00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
so think of so we can so they're not
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
walking in blind so if we can again use
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
November like to to her point to
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative point to bring forward
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
the doorways vote on it and maybe bring
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
some ideas in for potential topics for
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
number three there again um we can
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
recommend for the next committee so I
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
would like to suggest that we meet the
 
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
first week in December because because
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
it's organization day week and everybody
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
will be around I mean we had before
 
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559 align:start position:0%
organization some people won't be on may
 
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
not be on committee anymore well yes but
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
I mean there's Monday and Tuesday I was
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
going to say it has to be Monday or
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
Tuesday because we all become on Persons
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
at midnight that's true just like
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
Cinderella right we're going to leave
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
our glass slippers behind but we know
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
that people who have been
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
elected will be around that week so in
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
the mean time think
 
00:49:07.079 --> 00:49:09.109 align:start position:0%
the mean time think
of

00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
anything um that your constituent
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
suggests or that you think needs or
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
performance on it and um if there's
 
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.710 align:start position:0%
performance on it and um if there's
no

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
other business we can adjourn the
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
meeting and it looks like it's 10
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
2 however it's
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
