to support those and uh just like I said
 

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.230 align:start position:0%
to support those and uh just like I said
in<00:17:28.520><c> Normal</c><00:17:28.960><c> audit</c><00:17:29.240><c> we</c><00:17:29.360><c> would</c><00:17:29.559><c> be</c><00:17:29.679><c> able</c><00:17:29.880><c> to</c><00:17:30.039><c> do</c>

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
in Normal audit we would be able to do
 

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.870 align:start position:0%
in Normal audit we would be able to do

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
some kind of sample at the source and
 

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.150 align:start position:0%
some kind of sample at the source and
put<00:17:33.120><c> numbers</c><00:17:33.720><c> in</c><00:17:33.960><c> place</c><00:17:34.240><c> of</c><00:17:34.520><c> how</c><00:17:34.760><c> big</c><00:17:34.960><c> that</c>

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
put numbers in place of how big that
 

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
put numbers in place of how big that
risk<00:17:35.919><c> is</c><00:17:36.919><c> so</c><00:17:37.559><c> if</c><00:17:38.360><c> just</c><00:17:38.760><c> I</c><00:17:38.919><c> guess</c><00:17:39.200><c> one</c><00:17:39.440><c> more</c>

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
but next month my my point is that if we
 

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.990 align:start position:0%
but next month my my point is that if we
were<00:46:44.200><c> to</c><00:46:44.400><c> have</c><00:46:44.559><c> a</c><00:46:44.760><c> vote</c><00:46:45.240><c> on</c><00:46:45.400><c> a</c><00:46:45.559><c> scope</c><00:46:46.000><c> statement</c>

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
were to have a vote on a scope statement
 

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.510 align:start position:0%
were to have a vote on a scope statement
it<00:46:47.119><c> would</c><00:46:47.280><c> be</c><00:46:47.520><c> helpful</c><00:46:47.960><c> to</c><00:46:48.160><c> have</c><00:46:48.359><c> it</c><00:46:49.079><c> in</c>

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to have it in
 

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.069 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to have it in
November<00:46:50.200><c> so</c><00:46:50.480><c> we</c><00:46:50.599><c> could</c><00:46:50.880><c> vote</c><00:46:51.079><c> on</c><00:46:51.240><c> it</c><00:46:51.640><c> end</c><00:46:51.880><c> of</c>

00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
November so we could vote on it end of
 

00:46:52.079 --> 00:46:54.190 align:start position:0%
November so we could vote on it end of
November<00:46:52.800><c> which</c><00:46:52.920><c> is</c><00:46:53.079><c> always</c><00:46:53.440><c> problematical</c>

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
November which is always problematical
 

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.390 align:start position:0%
November which is always problematical
anyway<00:46:55.200><c> because</c><00:46:55.520><c> then</c><00:46:55.720><c> we</c><00:46:55.960><c> have</c><00:46:56.280><c> organiz</c>

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
anyway because then we have organiz
 

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.270 align:start position:0%
anyway because then we have organiz
day<00:46:57.760><c> and</c><00:46:57.960><c> reorganization</c><00:46:58.880><c> and</c><00:46:59.040><c> you're</c><00:46:59.160><c> going</c>
