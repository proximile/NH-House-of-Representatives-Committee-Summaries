00:03:08.319 --> 00:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.199 --> 00:05:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.800 --> 00:06:16.150 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.400 --> 00:08:16.869 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone i'm going to go
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
ahead and open the public hearing on hb
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
1278 and i will call representative
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning honorable members
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee i'm here today to
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
introduce hb 1278
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
whenever i introduce one of my bills i
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
never asked the committee to pass it i
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
never say please
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
get this otp i ask you only to consider
 
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.829 align:start position:0%
get this otp i ask you only to consider
it

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
you decide whether it's otp
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought to me the idea for
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
by a constituent it's going to tell you
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
a short story and this happened most
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
recently and i'd like to start by
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the committee's hard work
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
they did in recent years
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
working on the alimony laws of this
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
state and making them much more
 
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.509 align:start position:0%
state and making them much more
predictable

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
i hope that this proposed bill would
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
have no effect on that predictability or
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
the hard work you've already done back
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
to my story
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
so a constituent this is a woman she was
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
about 54 years old
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
she had been married for over 20 years
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
she was a stay-at-home mom
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
during the birth of her second child
 
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
during the birth of her second child
she

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
she
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
cut an injury that turned into
 
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
cut an injury that turned into
fibromyalgia

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
fibromyalgia
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
and she had a lot of health issues
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
so she
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
continued being a stay-at-home mom
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
until they get into their 50s and and
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
then been married several decades
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
well her husband at that time had been
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
become very successful
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
and he
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
was making somewhere in the mid six
 
00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.190 align:start position:0%
was making somewhere in the mid six
figures

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
figures
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
and everything was great
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
until such time as he decided that he'd
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
had enough
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
and he actually uh ended up marrying his
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
26 year old secretary
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
well this was devastating for the woman
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
but thanks to the predictability of our
 
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.509 align:start position:0%
but thanks to the predictability of our
laws

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
she knew that she will get some alimony
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
and she'd have a way to live
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
as a stay-at-home mom she had never
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
contributed to social security so she
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
did not qualify for social security
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
disability because she had no quarters
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
that she had put in
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
so her sole means of support
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
was that alimony
 
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.030 align:start position:0%
was that alimony
now

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
several months after the divorce was
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
final the husband threw a big wedding
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
for his new bride
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
they traveled had a huge honeymoon it
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
was all over facebook
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
difficult but such is life
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
and the problem now for her is
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
she's frozen in time
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
she's 50 something years old doesn't
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
have much time left to build a
 
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.430 align:start position:0%
have much time left to build a
relationship

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
if she
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
starts a dating relationship
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
or she decides to cohabitate with
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
someone she can fall in love with and
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
continue her life with she loses her
 
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.150 align:start position:0%
continue her life with she loses her
alimony

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
as the law is written it says a
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
substantial relationship or if they
 
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
substantial relationship or if they
cohabitate

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
cohabitate
 
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.790 align:start position:0%
cohabitate
now

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
this law proposes to fix that in that
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's still cohabitation and a
 
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.430 align:start position:0%
it's still cohabitation and a
relationship

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
can lead to the withdrawal of alimony
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
but first the judge has to make findings
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just the fact that she's fallen
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
in love and moved in with someone or
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
that they're in a substantial delayed
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
dating relationship
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
it has to be proven that that
 
00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:10.550 align:start position:0%
it has to be proven that that
relationship

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
is providing substantial financial
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
benefit to her
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
such as was already contemplated excuse
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
me by the judge
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me i got a frog
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
by the judge in his findings for the
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
alimony in the first place alimony is
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
designed to help both parties maintain
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
their standard of living as close as
 
00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:31.670 align:start position:0%
their standard of living as close as
possible

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
so should the new relationship
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
impact that that would be grounds to
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
withdraw the alimony
 
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:39.190 align:start position:0%
withdraw the alimony
however

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
if the woman 54 years old 55 disabled
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
meets another man
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
and he also is disabled and they both
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
just get a check
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
and they decide you know what let's live
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
together she loses her alimony she loses
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
her support based on the fact that she's
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
living with someone he doesn't have the
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
means to help her or to increase her
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
standard of living it's just two people
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
who want to live together and not be
 
00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:04.230 align:start position:0%
who want to live together and not be
alone

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
the way we have the law you know we hear
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
words like
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
like um
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
misogyny and patriarchy we hear them so
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
much that they become to mean nothing
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that's sad because it still does
 
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.629 align:start position:0%
and that's sad because it still does
exist

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
these laws were written a long time ago
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
and they were designed for men
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
if a woman
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
at 55 years old
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
can't date but her husband her
 
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.430 align:start position:0%
can't date but her husband her
ex-husband

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
ex-husband
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
can marry his 25-year-old secretary and
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
have children start a whole new life but
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
god forbid she wants to do the same she
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
loses her only means of support
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
so all this law does is say look
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
those are definitely grounds to do your
 
00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.710 align:start position:0%
those are definitely grounds to do your
alimony

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
but at least there has to be a finding
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
made that there's been a contribution
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
that would offset
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
the need for alimony
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
so as i said in the beginning i would
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
ask you to consider this law
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
and give it its due thought and
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
whatever you decide i respect thank you
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.750 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
representative

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
if the person
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:24.069 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
the alimony is based off of the standard
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
of living of the old relationship but if
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
they accepted this person that
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
has less money aren't they also
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
accepting that the new financial status
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the relationship thank you
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
indeed which is why you're absolutely
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
correct which is why the judge would
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
have to make a finding that the new
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
relationship brought financial benefit
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
and if it did
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
that would offset the alimony that's
 
00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:57.590 align:start position:0%
that would offset the alimony that's
correct

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying that
 
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.350 align:start position:0%
you're saying that
the

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
only way that it should be uh
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
considered that she's accepting the new
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
relationship and the financial impact
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
and all of that is if it it
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
increases her current standard of living
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
but not if she's not able to accept a
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
new relationship with a lower standard
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
of living
 
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
of living
and

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
and the other relationship be completely
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
separated at that point
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
is that what your position is
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
let me see if i can
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
in an example so that we understand what
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
we're both asking
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
the the man
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
remarries he's off on his own he's got
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
his new wife the woman
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
gets alimony that's her sole means of
 
00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:47.749 align:start position:0%
gets alimony that's her sole means of
support

00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:48.710 align:start position:0%
support
if

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
if she begins dating or moves in with
 
00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:52.710 align:start position:0%
if she begins dating or moves in with
someone

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
who has no money but perhaps their own
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
social security check
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
because now we're talking about people
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
in their 50s and 60s
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
that alone should not be grounds to
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
terminate her alimony
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
unless the standard of living that was
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
contemplated by the judge in the divorce
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
is met
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
through the contributions of the new
 
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
through the contributions of the new
relationship

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
if the new relationship does not provide
 
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.829 align:start position:0%
if the new relationship does not provide
a

00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
financial benefit
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
so that without the alimony
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
she'd be still living at the standard of
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
living contemplated by the judge
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
originally then it should not have an
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
effect on her ability to keep getting
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
her alimony
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative de simone
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.269 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
oh

00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
oh never mind
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
this question
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
is it possible
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
in your example that the person could
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
end up with two alimonies because the
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
first one
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
the the second marriage
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
the person made less than the first
 
00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:08.630 align:start position:0%
the person made less than the first
marriage

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.429 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
maybe you should rephrase the question i
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
i don't understand it
 
00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.350 align:start position:0%
i don't understand it
so

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
under the first alimony the only way for
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
it to be removed is if they get
 
00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.189 align:start position:0%
it to be removed is if they get
remarried

00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
remarried
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
and have a financial benefit
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
but you're saying if the person that
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
they remarried doesn't give them that
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
much of a financial benefit as the first
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
husband then the first alimony should
 
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.470 align:start position:0%
husband then the first alimony should
count

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
count
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
like still stay and then the person
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
could get divorced again
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
and uh from the second husband and then
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
get a second alimony because the first
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
alimony is still there and the second
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
alimony is there
 
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.470 align:start position:0%
alimony is there
um

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
i would say no because if they got a
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
second alimony that would offset the
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
first alimony and furthermore we already
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
agreed that the second husband
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any money to provide
 
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any money to provide
alimony

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.470 align:start position:0%
alimony
so

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
possibly strangely it could potentially
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
happen that but i believe that the first
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
alimony would be offset by the second
 
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.150 align:start position:0%
alimony would be offset by the second
alimony

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
so if she got divorced a second time
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
although we agreed doesn't have any more
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
money than she does
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
is tasked with paying her alimony first
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
of all they'd have to meet the length of
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
the marriage
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about people in their
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
50s but assuming all that arguemendo
 
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.310 align:start position:0%
50s but assuming all that arguemendo
happens

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
the judge from the first alimony case
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
would reduce the alimony from the first
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
husband based on the fact that she now
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
has more income
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy if you just email me i'd be
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
anyone on the committee
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative de simone
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'm confused now
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
i thought i understood this
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
can you clarify for me if
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
the female
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
who is receiving
 
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.470 align:start position:0%
who is receiving
alimony

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
moves in and lives with another person
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
the alimony continues
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
are you saying that if she marries this
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
other person you want the alimony to
 
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.270 align:start position:0%
other person you want the alimony to
continue

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
i am minus a finding from the judge
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
that the new marriage
 
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.270 align:start position:0%
that the new marriage
would

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
raise the standard of living beyond the
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
alimony so if two poor people get
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
married that doesn't necessarily mean
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
that the first person is living better
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
if two people living on social security
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
get remarried or get married that
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the other person
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
should lose their alimony from the first
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
marriage that they spent 20 or 30 years
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
simply because they moved in with
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
someone or married someone
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
only upon the finding that they married
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
a person who has money and is paying
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
further and if you look at the bill it
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
specifically says pays for their
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
cohabitation provides a means of
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
transportation those are indicators that
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay this person is benefiting
 
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.710 align:start position:0%
okay this person is benefiting
financially

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
financially
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
from this new marriage it seems to me um
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
just on its face so unfair that one
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
party can remarry have kids a whole new
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
family and the other person cannot
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
remarry without losing their means of
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
support even if the person they fall in
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
love with is poor it just doesn't seem
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
did i call you representative terry
 
00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:54.789 align:start position:0%
did i call you representative terry
earlier

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
you may have thought
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's why i got into the whole trouble
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
up next is
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
magic terror members of the committee my
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
name is richard head i'm the government
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
affairs coordinator for the judicial
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
branch following representative roy is
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
hard he's much taller than i am
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh okay there we go um so
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
as as was in my card i'm here to provide
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
information we do not have a position on
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
this bill um
 
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.830 align:start position:0%
this bill um
but

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
the bill as written will have an impact
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
on the judicial branch and i just wanted
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
to talk through sort of how this
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
involves the judicial branch and how
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
it may
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
have an impact in terms of how we would
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
interpret this bill or have to manage
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
and i'd point to lines five and six on
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
which strikes the cohabitation
 
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.549 align:start position:0%
which strikes the cohabitation
requirement

00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
and inserts that the payee has remarried
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
or is involved in a new romantic
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
relationship so there's two parts to it
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
either either
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
remarried or involved in a new romantic
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
relationship the new romantic
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
relationship is the part that at least
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
creates some some issues as to how
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
that's going to be interpreted it's not
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise used in statutes it's not
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise used in this
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
particular law
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
so there's going to have to be some
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation as to what that means and
 
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.230 align:start position:0%
interpretation as to what that means and
how

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
firm does that new remo
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
the romantic relationship have to be can
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
it be a date can it be you know how
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
extensive is that relationship
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
in lines 10 to 12
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
this is where sort of judicial resources
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
become involved
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
some of the criteria of
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
when it is that the the
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
alimony could be amended
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
and it talks about assistance in paying
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
household utilities beyond the amount
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
necessary to cover the cost of
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
additional persons and again this could
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
be in the context of a
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
romantic relationship there's going to
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
be litigation over that there's going to
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
be discovery over who's paying what
 
00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:13.909 align:start position:0%
be discovery over who's paying what
bills

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:14.630 align:start position:0%
bills
and

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.590 align:start position:0%
and
and

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
with regard to a person who is in a
 
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.430 align:start position:0%
with regard to a person who is in a
relationship

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
with another
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that's going to create
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
litigation create additional workloads
 
00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:25.909 align:start position:0%
litigation create additional workloads
on

00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
staff and and judges
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
in just in terms of litigating that
 
00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
in just in terms of litigating that
language

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
line 23 makes a reference to
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
cohabitation and it becomes sort of
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
unclear as to
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
given the fact that cohabitation was
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
struck as the standard why would being
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
there my guess is that's just an error
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
in the drafting but we pointed out
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
because that just creates more confusion
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of how the courts would now
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
have to interpret this
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
i also just note and again i think this
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
is just an error line two which
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
references the section
 
00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
references the section
458.99-a

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
think that should be 19-aaa not 99
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
so i think that's just a typo
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
and then with regard to line 18 which
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
repeals section 8 and some of this is is
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
sort of unclear again in terms of how
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
the courts would interpret this that
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph eight is the current law
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
that one if the bright line test of
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
cohabitation is met
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
section eight outlines the criteria by
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
which the court would then evaluate
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not alimony is no longer fair
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
or just and it includes sort of the
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
financial sharing that occurs in that
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
cohabitation relationship
 
00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:45.510 align:start position:0%
cohabitation relationship
and

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
economic independence and has other
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
considerations in that paragraph so that
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
would be struck for this new section
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
which in which involves those who are in
 
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.230 align:start position:0%
which in which involves those who are in
a

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
romantic relationship
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
it has similar criteria as what's in
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
that section eight
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
but once you strike that and you add new
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
ones the court now has to come through a
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
new set of trying to interpret and
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
figure out what was intended by that
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
change um so
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
as written at least
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
the the law is going to create new
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
elements of interpretation for the court
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
likely to increase some litigation
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
over those who are simply involved in a
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
romantic relationship over the financial
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
status of those two parties um so we do
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate an additional workload on the
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
courts with that i'd be happy to answer
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:42.630 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%

i i think it
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative roy is very tall
 
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.510 align:start position:0%
representative roy is very tall
yes

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
hi my name is vivian gerard and i'm here
 
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
hi my name is vivian gerard and i'm here
to

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.269 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
a little closer okay close to the bill
 
00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:52.470 align:start position:0%
a little closer okay close to the bill
but

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
if it was modified slightly i would
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
probably be more in favor of the bill
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
so just to give you a quick little
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
background about me is
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
i'm actually the silva v silva case for
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
the child support calculator i know that
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
you probably are wondering why i'm here
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
but because what happened to me
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
2014 when i separated
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
i was awarded alimony and during my
 
00:27:17.919 --> 00:27:19.350 align:start position:0%
i was awarded alimony and during my
divorce

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
the judge had way too many discretions
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
when she was going ahead and
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
ruling on my case
 
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.350 align:start position:0%
ruling on my case
and

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
with alimony at the time
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
she gave me six months to close my
 
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.029 align:start position:0%
she gave me six months to close my
business

00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
and if not she was going to take away
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
child support and alimony and she did
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
just that so unfortunately
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
the alimony was supposed to help offset
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
some of the bills from the family
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately the judge at the time
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
put on false
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
deviations on my case which eliminated
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
my child support and the alimony
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
and the way that
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
the next bill is going to be
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
for the um child support
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
if that bill passes people like me
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
will actually get hurt by it okay but
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about that bill okay
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
let's stay on this one and if you follow
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
where i'm going with this is
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
if you're going to go ahead and pass
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
this bill you should take into
 
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.669 align:start position:0%
this bill you should take into
consideration

00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:24.789 align:start position:0%
consideration
previous

00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
people that had alimony that was taken
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
away from them
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
because if if the child support and
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
alimony kind of go hand in hand if one
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
gets taken away the other one should be
 
00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.909 align:start position:0%
gets taken away the other one should be
compensated

00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
compensated
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
for the downfall of the difference in
 
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.070 align:start position:0%
for the downfall of the difference in
calculations

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
calculations
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
so in my
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
defense here
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
i would like to see an amendment to the
 
00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:47.190 align:start position:0%
i would like to see an amendment to the
bill

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
if people have been
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
awarded alimony in the past
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
and if this
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
in this case if if the child support
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
actually goes through
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
then we should be able to have a
 
00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.549 align:start position:0%
then we should be able to have a
reevaluation

00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
reevaluation
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
of our alimony in this case
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what i would like to be
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
considered as you guys go ahead and pass
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you um would you
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
believe that alimony and child support
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
are two totally separate issues they are
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
separate issues but when it's actually
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
supplying funding for a house especially
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
if the couple is married
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
married for 20 years
 
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.470 align:start position:0%
married for 20 years
and

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
it was actually in my case i was asked
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
to stay home and take care of our
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
children one of my daughters has a
 
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.029 align:start position:0%
children one of my daughters has a
disability

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
disability
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
and she's now 15. and during my my
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
divorce hearing
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
um they said that i was underemployed to
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
go out and get a job
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with my daughter's
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
disability that was not an option
 
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.110 align:start position:0%
disability that was not an option
so

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
in my case
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
i was awarded alimony and that should
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
have stayed
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
because i am the primary caregiver for
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
my children
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
so are you telling me that they took
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
away your alimony because you got child
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
support correct
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay they gave they did give me full
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
child support and the way that the judge
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
did it she said that
 
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.630 align:start position:0%
did it she said that
well

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't get full child support right
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
away i'm actually still fighting for it
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
um but recently i did get awarded full
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
child support but
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the in the very beginning she did
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
give me full child support so i could
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate alimony and then
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
then it this has been going on for seven
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
years so i apologize if it sounds
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
confusing so it was on it was off it was
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
on it was off so the whole time i should
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
have been getting alimony that could
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
have kept me and my children afloat but
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
it didn't because every time
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
the child support was up on appeal
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
i lost all child support and i didn't
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
have the alimony so i relied on
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers funding to help keep me and my
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
family afloat and that is not the job of
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
a taxpayers to help people like me
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
that was at home because of my children
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
that was a family decision
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
that was me compromising my employment
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
for my family
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
and if he's making a hundred and fifty
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
the tax payer should not be burdened in
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
order to keep my family
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
on food stamps
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
i mean that's
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
kind of part of the reason that you have
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
alimony and child support so that it
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
does not fall on the taxpayer as a
 
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.789 align:start position:0%
does not fall on the taxpayer as a
burden

00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
burden
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
and right now the way it is they should
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
reevaluate situations like mine not
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
everybody is a cookie cutter calculation
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
it should be more of like a flow chart
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
if you've been married for x amount of
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
years you should be doing this if you if
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
in my case
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
i i stayed in the family home i could
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
not afford to move out of the family
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
home so again another reason of the
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
alimony was also there to help
 
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.710 align:start position:0%
alimony was also there to help
maintain

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
equal living for my children so they did
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
not have to leave the school system
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
he made so much money that he could go
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
out and get another apartment i didn't
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
so i struggled for seven years it's been
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
a seven year sentence in my life
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
trying to stay afloat trying to keep
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
equal living from my children trying not
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
to disrupt them by taking them out of
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
the school system
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
so this all falls back on how it affects
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
the children how it affects the
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
household and if in my case i was
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
married for almost 20 years it was 19
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
years by the time we finally got our
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
official divorce
 
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.830 align:start position:0%
official divorce
and

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in my case
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
it was very unique and i will say that
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i would like that to be considered
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much you want
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
me to hand you these testimonies you can
 
00:32:57.919 --> 00:32:58.789 align:start position:0%
me to hand you these testimonies you can
just

00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
put them at the back at the end and they
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
can pass them around okay thank you
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
okay so pardon me one last thing is i
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
brought this i forgot to show you this
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
fight for alimony and child support this
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
is one here i and and trust me i know
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%

cost of living adjustment for the daily
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%

our daughter jade
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
as many of you are well aware foster
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
kids bring a level of richness
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
to a foster family's life whether it's
 
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.829 align:start position:0%
to a foster family's life whether it's
being

00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
a short-term integration or to a
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
permanent temporary long-term
 
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.310 align:start position:0%
permanent temporary long-term
integration

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
integration
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
the 900-plus foster kids that
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
reside in the state of new hampshire
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
rely on foster families to provide them
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
everyday quality of life that all
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
families give to
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
to all of their kids and grandkids you
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
know safety security food a roof over
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
their head clothes on their backs that
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
i ask that we increase
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
the cost of living adjustment by 1.3
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
percent on a couple of different things
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
number one social security
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh in the fall of last year raised their
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
benefit caller to 5.9 percent for all of
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
their benefits
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
number two is roughly this was last
 
00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.150 align:start position:0%
number two is roughly this was last
updated

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
updated
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
in july of 2018
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
what i would consider a a nominal bump
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
in the caller
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
in light of
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
when it was last stop stay updated
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
versus what social security has done
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
versus the the cost of
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
being able to put food on the table for
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
for a family today i think is
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
worthy of this committee's consideration
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.390 align:start position:0%
to make sure
that

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
the kids that are entrusted in our care
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
and in the foster family's care through
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
dcyf through department of health and
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
service health and human services
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
that the everyday needs of these
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
children are being met
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's that simple i thank you very much
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
for your time and i'd be more than happy
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
to answer any of your questions
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative boyd
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
question how is the um
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
current uh
 
00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:40.630 align:start position:0%
current uh
rate

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.790 align:start position:0%
rate
set

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
set
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
define what you mean by current rate
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
well you're trying to increase the daily
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
rate so how is it currently set is it in
 
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.910 align:start position:0%
rate so how is it currently set is it in
dhhs

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
rules or is it in statute
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's in statute
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding based on the
 
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.829 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding based on the
current

00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
rate sheet that i looked at that i have
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
this specific
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
categories you have generalized care
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
specialized care
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
emerging care crisis care
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
if when when my wife and i adopted our
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
daughter she was she was 12 or 13 at the
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
time if we were to doctor at this
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
particular time based on the current
 
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.589 align:start position:0%
particular time based on the current
rate

00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's 27.86
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
daily so it would be 1.3 percent off of
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
that which would be an increase of
 
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
that which would be an increase of
roughly

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
40 cents
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
can i follow up
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying so i'm trying to
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
understand why you put in
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
that the amount of the adjustments shall
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
be one percent increase instead of just
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
if it's in statute just adjusting the
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
when i
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
went to work
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
being new to the legislature and when i
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
went to work with ols on this
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
my impetus was looking at the cost of
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
living adjustment based on specific
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
indices whether it be libor whether it
 
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.510 align:start position:0%
indices whether it be libor whether it
be

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
social security whether it be department
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
of labor i was looking at a percentage
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
increase i wasn't exactly
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
looking specifically
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
at a rate at a specific line item rate
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
increase that's delineated on the
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
website representative
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
so that's how i was thinking about it
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
should i have thought about it
 
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.550 align:start position:0%
should i have thought about it
differently

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.950 align:start position:0%
differently
follow-up

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm not familiar with where the
 
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.870 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm not familiar with where the
this

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
those amounts are put
 
00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:47.030 align:start position:0%
those amounts are put
who

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
who pays this amount is it the taxpayers
 
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.710 align:start position:0%
who pays this amount is it the taxpayers
yes

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
saying none
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
wait a minute representative litchfield
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you're
 
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you're
welcome

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm just the same as representative
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
ocala i'm just trying to understand so i
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
understand why you went with percentage
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
versus dollar amount this is the advice
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
that you've been given
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
curious why the one percent and do you
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
feel that am i hearing you correctly 40
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
excuse me 40 cents above the daily rate
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
will this make a difference i'm just
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
trying to understand so i'm trying to be
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
prudential with the taxpayers money i
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
easily could have asked for the same
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustment that social
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
security gave their retirees a 5.9
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
percent i felt that that might be overly
 
00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:40.710 align:start position:0%
percent i felt that that might be overly
onerous

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
onerous
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
i thought based on
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
current projections and what the
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
legislative legislature did historically
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
back in 18 which was 1.3 percent i felt
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
that that would be
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
based on on what what we've done
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
historically would be an appropriate
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
increase for the for the committee and
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
for the house to consider as opposed to
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
5.9 which i
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
quite honestly based on
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
current numbers i felt would be a little
 
00:41:07.839 --> 00:41:08.550 align:start position:0%
current numbers i felt would be a little
bit

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit more
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
less prudential than what i would
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
view how we would be spending the
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollar
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%

because i instinctively know
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%

a whole
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
i am not an expert in these matters at
 
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.829 align:start position:0%
i am not an expert in these matters at
all

01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
however this bill has been created by
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
those who are very knowledgeable in this
 
01:01:55.839 --> 01:01:58.069 align:start position:0%
those who are very knowledgeable in this
topic

01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
topic
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
it is well understood in research that
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
children do their best with parents who
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
share equal and nearly equal parenting
 
01:02:07.039 --> 01:02:08.549 align:start position:0%
share equal and nearly equal parenting
time

01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
many parents who seek
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
to take part in raising their children
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
their child in a meaningful and
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
significant way in new hampshire
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
find themselves challenged
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire laws on child
 
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.430 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire laws on child
support

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
in 2018 in the new hampshire supreme
 
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.109 align:start position:0%
in 2018 in the new hampshire supreme
court

01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
made a judgment
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
in its interpretation of the existing
 
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.349 align:start position:0%
in its interpretation of the existing
rsas

01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
on the modification of child support for
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
parenting time
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
in silva v silva
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
with their strict interpretation of the
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
term fixed
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
modification of a full child support
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
order cannot be made without a reduction
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
in fixed costs of the parent who earns
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
less income resulting in a full child
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
support being awarded to the other part
 
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:59.910 align:start position:0%
support being awarded to the other part
parent

01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
this this was never the intention of
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
our rsas
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
before silva v silver
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
there was a genuine recognition
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
that while children are
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
in a parent's care
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
there are costs to to uh to care for
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
prior to this judgment seventy percent
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
of all orders were modified and
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
parenting time was
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
the primary reason
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
also in in 2018
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%

carsey institute of unh
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
was completed and presented to this
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee and to the department of
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is a reflection of the
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations in this report requests
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
and requests of our family courts
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
then in
 
01:03:54.839 --> 01:03:56.630 align:start position:0%
then in
2020

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
the case of anderson v anderson was
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
brought to the new hampshire supreme
 
01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:02.870 align:start position:0%
brought to the new hampshire supreme
court

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
this case had to do with shared
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
parenting and fixed costs
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
upon one of the anderson's
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
seeking relief that relief
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
was denied
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
but the reason was
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
the supreme court pointed back to the
 
01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
the supreme court pointed back to the
legislature

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
to the legislature
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
to address the law
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
as there was no such guideline for child
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
support for which the courts could
 
01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
support for which the courts could
follow

01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
this this bill provides that guideline
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
in 2001
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
just last year
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
a similar bill to this is passed in the
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
committee and on the house floor
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
that bill language was not accepted by
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
the senate judiciary committee
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
in this bill house bill 1647
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
we have made some simplifying language
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
changes and addressed the percentage of
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
child support allocated
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
we will
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
be working with the appropriate senators
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
to garner support for these much-needed
 
01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:09.589 align:start position:0%
to garner support for these much-needed
changes

01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
in our statutes if this bill does indeed
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
pass through the house
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%

spoken before the committee before and i
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
know many of you have been here working
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
a while on this committee and
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
i know you aren't highly paid so
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that you're putting your
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
time and effort into this
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
my name is brenda towne and i'm a mother
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
of four kids a grandmother of 8.25
 
01:07:33.359 --> 01:07:34.630 align:start position:0%
of four kids a grandmother of 8.25
grandchildren

01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
grandchildren
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
and i became the unwitting
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
advocate for parents in new hampshire
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
because of a family situation
 
01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:44.470 align:start position:0%
because of a family situation
so

01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
i ended up in the throes of this with a
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
custody battle
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
that involved my four young
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and as i waded deeper and
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
deeper into the
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
bowels of our laws
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
i recognized that there were things that
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
just weren't working well and it
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
catapulted me to become a parental
 
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.630 align:start position:0%
catapulted me to become a parental
advocate

01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
i led a group of 5 000 parents on
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
facebook on a daily basis i triaged
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
inbound calls from parents who were just
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
struggling and in bad shape
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
i just need you to talk about the bill
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so i just wanted to give that
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
as a background because it led me to in
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
into this space for child support
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
because this was one critical area that
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
was affecting those parents so i so i've
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
included in my testimony a little
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
history because i went through it and
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
about a decade ago we had a bill hb
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
which transitioned into hb 378
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
and that was a shared parenting bill
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
that became a child support bill
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
and um from there it rolled into a study
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
and in 2016 we agreed to do this study
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
on child support statewide and you heard
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative romney talk about the
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
fact that we paid five hundred thousand
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
dollars to have the car seat school to
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
do that research study it involved
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
interviewing lawyers judges gals
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
social workers and also research into
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
our own new hampshire practices
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
and with that work they brought forward
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
three recommendations
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the three recommendations they
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
brought forward are represented in this
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
bill now we had the
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful opportunity of two worlds
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
colliding at once as this research paper
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
was coming forward silva v silva was
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
judged in our supreme courts so the
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
report came out and it didn't consider
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
the impact of our legend of our judges
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
not being able to now modify child
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
support based on parenting time that was
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom line of silva v silva unless
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
a parent could prove that fixed costs of
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
the other parent were reduced and they'd
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
used a very uh webster definition on
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
fixed cost which was
 
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
fixed cost which was
household

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
household
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
mortgage rent car there was no
 
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.950 align:start position:0%
mortgage rent car there was no
modification

01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
modification
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
so since that time period parents who
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
have entered our family courts have
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
faced down fighting for the custody of
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
their kids because we all know that's
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
the right thing for their kids but at
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
the same time our child support orders
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
were not contemporary and they didn't
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
keep up with the trend
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
so we end up today with um households
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
sharing 50 50 responsibility of raising
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
the kids but our child support orders
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
are issued from the higher earner and
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
100 of that is given to the other
 
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.470 align:start position:0%
100 of that is given to the other
household

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
household
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
now what that has done is it has
 
01:10:50.239 --> 01:10:51.510 align:start position:0%
now what that has done is it has
hamstrung

01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
hamstrung
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
that second household that's handing out
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
this child support order and again it's
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
based um you know it goes through our
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
standard worksheet i provided my
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
testimony and in the back i provided my
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
son's actual worksheet
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
and you can see that he made roughly a
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars more
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
than his the other parent
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
but the the court ordered a child
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
support order of
 
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.550 align:start position:0%
support order of
1152

01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
1152
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
and they awarded the entire order
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
from him to his ex
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
and when you put the finances together
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
in their houses it ended up that
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
his household
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
was about
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
around 1100 a month less than hers and i
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
have the numbers in here and i promised
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't read it
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
so we know that this is a problem and
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
this is happening every day
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
so what this bill and what the
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations from car seat did is it
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
said you know what today
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have more and more shared parenting
 
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.110 align:start position:0%
we have more and more shared parenting
households

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
households
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
and so what we're going to do is
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's a cost associated
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
with having two households so they
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
raised the overall order by 150 percent
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
so there's a 50 percent more allocation
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
of funds put in the pool for the parents
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
to manage the kids knowing full well
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
that there's two households
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
it is then allocated based on income to
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
the respective households but there is a
 
01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
the respective households but there is a
credit

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.510 align:start position:0%
credit
for

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
the parenting time that is given based
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
on the full order so if the full order
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
let's say was three thousand dollars and
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
there was a 60 40 split of how that
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
order would be
 
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
order would be
generated

01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
generated
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
that order would be raised by a hundred
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
and fifty percent
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
but yet
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
sixty forty percent of the parenting
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
time credit against that original order
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
would be applied to the parent who paid
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
the child support
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
thereby reducing the cost so in my son's
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
case the example i included his child
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
support with four children which
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
garners about a forty percent gross
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
income child support order which is huge
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
went from a thousand one hundred dollars
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
down to about 250.
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
there and leveled the houses and again
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers are in this
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
paperwork for you
 
01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.790 align:start position:0%
paperwork for you
so

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
last year we worked really hard to get
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
and this committee supported us and we
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're stuck because we have nowhere to
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
go we've been told by our own supreme
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
court you need to come back and figure
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
this out with the legislators
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
so we need your help all right
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
right now and i've included again in
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
this document a layout of the child
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
support orders for identical family
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
compositions around our country
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see that new hampshire is number
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
three in the highest child support
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
orders in the country
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
we are 40 percent higher than the mean
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
of our entire country
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's a problem and we need to fix it
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
we were given feedback last year that
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why this didn't pass was
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
under the covers two things
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
one item was there was a real concern
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
that there would be an influx of parents
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
who came in and said please update my
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
order now that you've fixed this problem
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's been going on all right
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that i don't think that should scare
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
us i think we should figure out how to
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
manage that
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
the second thing which is most learning
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
as a state get eight million dollars a
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
year in matches for our child support
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
court orders due to title four d
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
if we modify these orders to bring them
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
down to respect shared parenting the
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
match will go down
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
and i would hope and pray that the state
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire would not use that as a
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
justification to not make these
 
01:14:51.679 --> 01:14:53.350 align:start position:0%
justification to not make these
well-overdue

01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
well-overdue
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
changes that need to happen for our
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
families so i leave you with one of my
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
favorite verses
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%

i'm
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
i have two questions one is what are
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
those fixed costs and where are they
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
where are they annotated
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
so i can refer back to that and also
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
in on line eight does it refer do those
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
two lines refer back to page one line
 
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.470 align:start position:0%
two lines refer back to page one line
eight

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
referencing child overnights
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
so the fixed cost was not intended to to
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
be an exact
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
um prescription
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
the problem that we ran into was with
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
silva v silva there was a webster
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
definition used and so the reduction of
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
fixed costs from a broader context is
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to just simply using a car
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
payment and rent
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
we look at the fixed costs of raising a
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
children the food the clothing all of
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
the things associated with raising a kid
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
and having them in your household so
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would be my interpretation of the
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
fixed costs we're referring to
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
where we got feedback in prior years is
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
that there had been no definition of
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
what shared parenting was and that was a
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
stumbling block
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
so the most likely and most commonly
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
used definition of shared parenting is
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
overnight time
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
because that normally drives the number
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
of bedrooms and a house and other things
 
01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:13.669 align:start position:0%
of bedrooms and a house and other things
so

01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
we chose that
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
i would tell you personally i am not
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
hung up on it but i wanted to be able to
 
01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.669 align:start position:0%
hung up on it but i wanted to be able to
provide

01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
to this body
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
a definition that would allow us to have
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
at least a stake in the ground
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing as i'm here at the mic
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
that i did want to also add that i
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
didn't include in my testimony is that
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things that
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
came out of the car seat school as well
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
as a personal interview with judge
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
ashley is that our legislat our judges
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
in family court are actually asking us
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
for more prescription
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
they feel like there is a lack of
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
continuity between our courthouses on
 
01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.550 align:start position:0%
continuity between our courthouses on
judgments

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
judgments
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
so the recommendation in this bill is an
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
exact representation of the vermont
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
calculations that have been in practice
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
for over a decade and they're the
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
closest as far as demographics to new
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire as far as using
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
child support laws so again thank you
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
and if are there any other questions
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions you may
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up madam chair follow up
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um miss town uh with regard to
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
the car seat school is in your testimony
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
that um i just got here at the desk
 
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.590 align:start position:0%
that um i just got here at the desk
um

01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
in your second paragraph you're talking
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
about uh a study that was performed is
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
that what you're referencing
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
the cause is that the study you're
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
talking about awesome so we can just go
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
to their website excellent well it's
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually posted on our own dhhs website
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
great um so there had been a minor error
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
in one of the exhibits they updated and
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
refreshed it it's been there for two
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
years and we have it there as part of
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
our federal requirements for managing
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
our child support process
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the clarification
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you for being
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
here thank you okay any further
 
01:19:01.679 --> 01:19:04.310 align:start position:0%
here thank you okay any further
questions

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.590 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
much

01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
up next is representative yokela
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:21.110 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
committee

01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
i have pat i believe has been passed
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
around an amendment to this bill
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
if not it should be coming your way
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
there's also some examples of
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
um of what i'm proposing the new child
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
child support worksheet might look like
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
so that you would be able to fill it in
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
yourself and would have a few examples
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and that looks like it's being passed
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
around now
 
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.270 align:start position:0%
around now
and

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.229 align:start position:0%
and
so

01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
um was is it trying to address some of
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
the things that the senate had an issue
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
with which was clarity
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
they didn't they felt that the um the
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
calculation was too
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
complicated for them to understand and
 
01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.030 align:start position:0%
complicated for them to understand and
so

01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
parts of the formula have been broken
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
down in smaller parts so that it's more
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
clear and readily understandable and so
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
each in the examples of
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
1 through 13 14
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
each one of those
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
is now
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
defined as part of the amendment and so
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
that you can understand how those
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
calculations are done and they they
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
conform to the
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
subtraction and addition and
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
multiplication that is that is uh
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
suggested on this worksheet
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to do
 
01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.229 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to do
is

01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to take a step back and
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
say what is child support
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
child support is
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
what we are
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
making sure that each family
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
is spending on the raising of their
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
child um each person is contributing to
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
the raising of their child and one part
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
of contributing to raising your child is
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
actually housing them
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
and um another is a financial aspect and
 
01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.470 align:start position:0%
and um another is a financial aspect and
so

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's not always the case that those are
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
handled by the same person and so we're
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
trying to make it so that those people
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
are are you know if they make 75 of the
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
money they're contributing 75 percent of
 
01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:46.550 align:start position:0%
money they're contributing 75 percent of
the

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
the um financial responsibility and if
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting if they're housing the
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
kid you know 50 of the time or 25 of the
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
time that they're getting credit for
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
doing that parenting in the calculation
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
and that is the basis of my amendment
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to walk through it if you
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
guys want but i i hope that it will be
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
as clear as i tried to make it
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
with that i will be happy to take any
 
01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.470 align:start position:0%
with that i will be happy to take any
questions

01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for

representative yokela
 
01:22:20.639 --> 01:22:22.950 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
oh

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
did you want to say something else yeah
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead so
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of other things
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
sorry that i um forgot to mention inside
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the amendment is a change to the um
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
self-support reserve
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
we were suggested by this carson study
 
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
to just do a modest increase from
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
115 to 120 of the federal poverty
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
um line which would only leave people
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
on the lowest end with about sixteen
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so it was
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
discussed that that
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
really isn't
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
enough to be able to live in new
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire and so um it was
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh amended to instead be a hundred and
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of the reserve so that
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
would be just over two twenty thousand
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to be able to live on so that
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
the that these child support orders are
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
not putting people in in the position of
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
being homeless in new hampshire
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions for
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
representative yokela thank you
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for this very detailed
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendment i think i might have more
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions for you
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
during their executive session but at
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:43.910 align:start position:0%
the moment
um

01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
the definitions your your change is just
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
to one is to add 1b
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
could you repeat it i couldn't really on
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
page one of your amendment okay your the
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
only change
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
to rsa 458 c2 would be to add in
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's an addition
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
yes that's additional language right yes
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
the bold on line 17 through 21 is
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
additional um everything above that is
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
so it's just kind of breaking it out
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
into a another step of the formula so
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
you have gross pro
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
gross income then adjusted gross income
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
and then you get to
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
another adjustment which was already put
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
in law i was just breaking them out into
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
smaller pieces so that people would
 
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.189 align:start position:0%
smaller pieces so that people would
understand

01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
what is the math that is happening at
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
each step
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
so that anyone should be able to follow
 
01:24:50.239 --> 01:24:53.270 align:start position:0%
so that anyone should be able to follow
this

01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
may i follow up madam chair
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
could you explain uh because i i don't
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
understand the verbiage on page three
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
line eighteen
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm struggling with child support
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
obligation calculation means
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
the parent's household responsibility
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
minus the parent's financial
 
01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.189 align:start position:0%
minus the parent's financial
responsibility

01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
what is the differentiation between
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
financial household
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
and financial responsibility thank you
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
for the question yeah thank you i
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
so those
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
um phrases are terms of art right that
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
are also defined inside the statute so
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
um child
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
parents household responsibility if you
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
look down on 20 to 21 it says parents
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
household responsibility means the
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
parents household responsibility
 
01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.030 align:start position:0%
parents household responsibility
percentage

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
like the percentage of the household
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility that they have multiplied
 
01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.229 align:start position:0%
responsibility that they have multiplied
by

01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:25:58.239 --> 01:25:59.030 align:start position:0%
by
the

01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
total support obligation and the total
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
support obligation is defined somewhere
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
else as
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
the amount that needs to be
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
um contributed to the child for raising
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
the child per year so if it's you know
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars that we need to
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
be paid paying to raise a child and you
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
parent that you have the household fifty
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
percent of the time then we would assume
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
that you are contributing to the raising
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
of that child for
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of twenty thousand which
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay could you follow up may i follow up
 
01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.510 align:start position:0%
okay could you follow up may i follow up
um

01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps i need to look in statute if you
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
if we're
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
if if you look at um the example
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
worksheet do you have that one
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
with the example
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
worksheet like a four four page thing of
 
01:26:48.719 --> 01:26:49.830 align:start position:0%
worksheet like a four four page thing of
examples

01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
examples
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes sir got it
 
01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.229 align:start position:0%
yes sir got it
beautiful

01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
beautiful
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
so household responsibility percentage
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
is found in the parenting plan
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
right it's going to tell you how often
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to have the kids
 
01:27:02.159 --> 01:27:02.870 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to have the kids
and

01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be based off of the
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
best interests of the child as we've
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
we've um hammered home a million times
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
and and uh changed the statute to
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
reflect pretty much everywhere um the
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
parenting plan is going to be based on
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child and then
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
work on that that's on line 11 and so to
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
get the household responsibility we're
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
going to multiply line eight which is
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
the total support resp uh obligation
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
times 11 which will get you your amount
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
so there are some examples of amounts um
 
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.550 align:start position:0%
so there are some examples of amounts um
on

01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
the subsequent pages so that you would
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i need a little time
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
to digest but absolutely
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
you okay we're running short on time so
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm keeping people to the time they

this undercuts everything that i've
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
worked so hard to accomplish
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
as i had said previously in my testimony
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%

01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
primary residential for the children
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
i was a stay-at-home mom for 13 years
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
with my children
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
my daughter has a disability we opened
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
up a family-owned business
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i could stay home and raise my
 
01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:01.430 align:start position:0%
so i could stay home and raise my
children

01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
and care for my elderly parents
 
01:29:04.239 --> 01:29:05.430 align:start position:0%
and care for my elderly parents
and

01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
the silva v silva case
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
came up because of
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the child support calculators
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
that they they've been trying to use
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
just did not fit for me
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
and by having a stay-at-home business
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
there was we had to find a way
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain two households
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
maintain normalcy for my children keep
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
them in the same house that they grew up
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
in keep them in the same school system
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
allow me to operate my stay-at-home
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
business my at-home business if i get
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
forced out of my house i am un
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
unemployed not underemployed but
 
01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.950 align:start position:0%
unemployed not underemployed but
essentially

01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:50.070 align:start position:0%
essentially
unemployed

01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
these child support calculators should
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
not be this difficult
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
again as i had mentioned earlier it
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
would be great if
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
there was different calculators to fit
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
different lifestyles
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
one calculator will not be the same for
 
01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.189 align:start position:0%
one calculator will not be the same for
everybody

01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
again if you use it as similar to a flow
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
chart as they do in companies if
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's married for 20 years
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
at home business stay-at-home mom
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
they're staying in the family home in
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
order to keep the children in the same
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
school system and he goes off to another
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
town with his girlfriend and living in
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
another town
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
why should i not be able to keep my
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
children in the same household the same
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
school system
 
01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.310 align:start position:0%
school system
by

01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
undercutting the silva v silva case
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
you're you're essentially doing that
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to force us out of the
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
household or force us to rely more on
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers to bear that burden that
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
somebody of a hundred and fifty thousand
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
dollars should be able to make
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
and and and take that money and give it
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
to the family
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody decides that they want to
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
move on in a different direction
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
why should the family suffer for
 
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
somebody that can't keep his pants on
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
realistically again you know we have a
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
family owned business
 
01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:13.110 align:start position:0%
family owned business
and

01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
the judge at the time
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
said that my
 
01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.070 align:start position:0%
said that my
employment

01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
was under employment because i was not
 
01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:21.750 align:start position:0%
was under employment because i was not
making

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
as much as
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
i i did 15 years prior 15 years prior
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
i was a buyer
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
high-tech company
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
i can't go step foot in in a purchasing
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
position after 15 years i lost all my
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
skills i purchased this home so i could
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
have a stay-at-home business
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
and i put every cent i had into this
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
built building and and into my home
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
what we were supposed to do before the
 
01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:53.750 align:start position:0%
what we were supposed to do before the
divorce

01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
so my life never got preserved by these
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
judges my financial stability got never
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
never got preserved
 
01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:03.189 align:start position:0%
never got preserved
my

01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:32:03.199 --> 01:32:04.229 align:start position:0%
my
kids

01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
family dynamics
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
if i take them out of that household
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
that will not be preserved
 
01:32:11.679 --> 01:32:12.629 align:start position:0%
that will not be preserved
so

01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:12.639 --> 01:32:14.629 align:start position:0%
so
again

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
this is what happens when you have
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
22 hearings
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
five supreme court appeals
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is all the problems that i'm still
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
and at this point as i had mentioned to
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
you guys before
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
i do not support this bill
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
because as of right now
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh by giving
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
judges these calculators again it does
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
and even with the silva v silva case
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
these judges aren't even being held
 
01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.110 align:start position:0%
these judges aren't even being held
to

01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
any standards that they even have to
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
follow the laws
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
here i am seven years later and they
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
still have not
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
resolved the silva v silva case
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
so my children had to sacrifice over all
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
these years for things that they should
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
have had that that were easy
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
you know most kids have braces
 
01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:17.270 align:start position:0%
you know most kids have braces
medical

01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
food on their plate
 
01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.830 align:start position:0%
food on their plate
vacations

01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
vacations
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
activities my kids did not have any of
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
that growing up they get it with their
 
01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
that growing up they get it with their
father

01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
father
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
because he makes so much more than i do
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
and here i am seven years later and i'm
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
still struggling to maintain a household
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
for my children
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
the mortgages don't go down you have to
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
keep going quickly okay
 
01:33:40.639 --> 01:33:41.510 align:start position:0%
keep going quickly okay
okay

01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
and and realistically utilities and
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
everything else do not go down so even
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
if you give one parent a certain
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
calculator it doesn't help keep them in
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
that same household
 
01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.870 align:start position:0%
that same household
so

01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is not just
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
a law
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
this is my life
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
this is what i had to live the last
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
seven years so by going ahead and
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
approving something without looking at
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
all the different reasons for it you're
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
just going to keep creating more appeals
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
and more court hearings
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
and more strain on families and and
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
these families that are going through
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
this the pain is real
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
so i would like for you to consider that
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
as you're going ahead and approve in
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
as well as many other bills because this
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
is not a game this is our life and then
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
in three years we go back and revisit it
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to be right back to where we
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
are now
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and i would like to
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
assure you that no one up here thinks
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's a game well okay
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
again i've been living this and i'm back
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
and forth every i understand but i just
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that not one person at
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
this table thinks this is a game thank
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
up next is michael dinan and he's asked
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
for 10 minutes and i ask if maybe you
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
can go a little quicker than that
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
if you just want to hand it and they'll
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah they'll just pass it around thank
 
01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:20.709 align:start position:0%
yeah they'll just pass it around thank
you

01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and members of
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
the committee thanks for having me speak
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm in support of hp 1647 i want to
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
keep it clear and hopefully very brief
 
01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:32.470 align:start position:0%
keep it clear and hopefully very brief
um

01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
speaking about when i've passed this all
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
out it can all be read as well i want to
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
cover the calculations there's always
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
this matter of confusion when these
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
things come up and it just came up with
 
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.470 align:start position:0%
things come up and it just came up with
josh

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
josh
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
ukele as well
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
if i want to look at this simply and i'm
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
not a math major or anything like that
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
you take both um the percentage that is
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
attributed which let's say as an example
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
for two children is 25 percent if the
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
higher earner makes 60 000 as an example
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
the lower earner makes 30 000 you
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
combine those what is 26 percent of that
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
let's just call it 25 it's 22 000
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
of is 26
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
if the lower earner um
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
is responsible for a third of that
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
then the higher earner is responsible
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
for two thirds of that
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
that lower earner
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me the higher earner would pay
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
the difference to the lower earner it's
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
that simple it's very clear it's not
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
ambiguous it provides a very clear
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
language for judges for people that are
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
pro se such as myself representing
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
myself and also the rest of the uh
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
of the state so i just want to read
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
through this quickly to touch on many of
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
the points some of this will be staring
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
at what you've heard already uh
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
current state of guidelines is perverse
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
and detrimental to new hampshire i'm
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
going to ask you not to read your
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
testimony okay because we have it
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
just point out some of the highlights of
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
it because we will read it understood
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
since silva v silva in 2018 november of
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
2018 and if you look at the back of what
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
you've been handed out you can look at
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
the calculations if the lower earner
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
makes a dollar less than the higher
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
earner or even just a dollar annually
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
meaning no job they receive roughly the
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
same amount of income
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
from the the higher earner this is not
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
make believe this is what happens all
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
the cases anderson b anderson which
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
abrami had mentioned
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
states the same thing all of the funds
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
go to the lower earner the funds that
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
are intended as an example the 26
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
percent was meant to be shared across
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
two households in the case in sylvie
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
silva which is precedent and now
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
actually anderson v anderson's become
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
precedent as well
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
all the funds go to the owner lower
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
earner the higher earners left sometimes
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
in an indigent state
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
meaning that people that have a low
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
income already if they're not having the
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
day-to-day funds to pay for their
 
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.030 align:start position:0%
day-to-day funds to pay for their
children's

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
children's
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
everyday fixed costs being put a roof
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
over their head they are left with
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
nothing this is not imagination
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
the car she school says the same the
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
dartmouth study and you can see it in
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
there and i cite it and there are links
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's not an active document but you can
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
look at what the national um
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
family council gave to the state and f
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
and this isn't some like
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
you know perception thing this is a
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
reality we're third highest in the whole
 
01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.470 align:start position:0%
reality we're third highest in the whole
country

01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
so some people and have been speaking
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
today about their personal cases
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
in fact it's the silva v silva that has
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
gone back and forth with the supreme
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
court but that precedent states it's
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
called starry decisis it will not be
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
changed and yes i would admit that that
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
vivian has had
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
her case lowered they keep lowering it
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
back to the original amount then it gets
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
passed back up to the supreme court what
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's about is the language that is in
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
our current guidelines it's very clear
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
that it says
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
equal or approximately equal parenting
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
time is not grounds for deviation add
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
that to the fixed cost points that
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
everyone else has pointed out today and
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
you have this disastrous scenario that
 
01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.510 align:start position:0%
you have this disastrous scenario that
again

01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:38:59.430 --> 01:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's 70 or greater that have happened
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
since 2018 and if they haven't suffered
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
it they're going to be coming up for
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
their three-year re-up and revisitation
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
to their guidelines that everyone will
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
be suffering this everyone's going to be
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
going through this so wanted to talk
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
about what about the legislation the
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
previous attempts to have legislation go
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
through that were scrutinized because of
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
the the factors that that brenda had
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
brought up as well these factors are you
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
know that it's going to be catastrophic
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
to our courts well they're already
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed because of of silva v silva
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
that amount can be weight you know it
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
can be said to be enacted in 2023 or or
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
before the three years which everyone
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
has got to revisit their their um
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
calculations that the the calculations
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
are confusing and yes they are what this
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill does 1647 is provides an easy
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
prescription for everyone to follow to
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
understand it allows for deviations
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
based on certain criteria but it does
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
not create this wild west environment
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
that happens when everyone goes into
 
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:55.910 align:start position:0%
that happens when everyone goes into
court

01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i've suffered it and everyone else
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
is beginning to stop for this so if you
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
read through my testimony if you get a
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
chance you look at the numbers in the
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
back which is clearly showing someone
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
makes a dollar versus the the higher
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
earner someone makes nothing it causes
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
the lower earner to intentionally be
 
01:40:12.159 --> 01:40:13.510 align:start position:0%
the lower earner to intentionally be
underemployed

01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
underemployed
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
what the current guidelines do and
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
there's some other
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
bills that are being looked at right now
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
and in the other bills too it does the
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
same thing okay let's stick to this bill
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
because we're really short on time
 
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the language in 1647
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
it does provide for exceptions it does
 
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
provide a very clear
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
non-ambiguous non-um
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
subjective because a lot of the stuff is
 
01:40:39.679 --> 01:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
subjective because a lot of the stuff is
subjective

01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
so it it's very
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
straightforward if you look at the
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
higher earner the lower earner it allows
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
you to figure it out i just did that
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
math in my head this isn't something
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's complex but what it would do is
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
save new hampshire families just want to
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
make the critical point besides all this
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
math and calculations
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
in my case i am left with not enough
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
funds to even pay for my home because
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
the full child support amount goes to
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
the lower earner in that case they are
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
provided with a kind of lavish lifestyle
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
that prevents them from wanting to get a
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
job if they put in a if you put in a
 
01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.070 align:start position:0%
job if they put in a if you put in a
um

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know a parenting amount based on
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
parenting time it's the only way to
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
establish it in my case i have the more
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
than 50 of the time but that doesn't
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
matter i still pay the full amount and
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
in the case of of what 1647 would do it
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
would take reality into to account i
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
want to make something clear parenting
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
plans are established before
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
the child support guidelines are
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
established so every time without
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
ambiguity they're established first so
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
you can't in some special interest
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
parties want to say well you can't put
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
parenting time based on the financial
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
obligation of the parents
 
01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:53.109 align:start position:0%
obligation of the parents
well

01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
it it actually is decided beforehand
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's no way to associate the two and
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
that guides that misunderstanding of how
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
the law works has been misused by many
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
people when talking about these bills so
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
i don't need to go any further but would
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
like to answer any questions um and i
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
think if you could take a glance at the
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
testimony the grades the car seat school
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
study the dartmouth school study
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees just how to go about it
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
how do we make that change 1647 is the
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
most effective it is fair it gets us
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
back to reality
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
grateful and does anyone have any
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
questions okay does anyone have any
 
01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:32.070 align:start position:0%
questions okay does anyone have any
questions

01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
up next is richard head to speak for
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
three minutes just for informational
 
01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.109 align:start position:0%
three minutes just for informational
purposes

01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
three minutes mr head thank you um thank
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair members of the committee
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
my name is richard head i'm the
 
01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
government affairs coordinator for the
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
judicial branch i have one very
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
specific point i would like to make
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the bill is drafted which is
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
it has no applicability clause
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
so you've heard about the
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
the potential impact on caseloads in the
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court and again when i'm
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
talking circuit court i'm talking family
 
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
division probate division and
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
district and all of those are being
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
impacted by various bills but this
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
has the potential to have a significant
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
impact on the circuit courts as it
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
relates to family division in that it
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
the lack of a of an applicability clause
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
means it applies to all existing orders
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
and i'll point out that the last time
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
this section was changed which was uh in
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
a 2012 bill
 
01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:36.830 align:start position:0%
a 2012 bill
that

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill being uncoordinated house bill 597
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
in 2012
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
had a very specific applicability clause
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
which said it shall not apply to a valid
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
child support order in effect on the
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
effective date of this act until the
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
next scheduled review hearing so it did
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
allow for ultimately the the new
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
provisions to be
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
to be applied
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
but it avoids that rush to the
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
courthouse and that's the the primary
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
point that i wanted to bring out we do
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
very specifically ask no matter whether
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's representative yokela's amendment
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
or or some other version that there be
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
an applicability clause in order that we
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
can have some level of control
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
over the hearings that are going to come
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
to the circuit court i'm sorry can you
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
just repeat what that bill was when you
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
yep absolutely and the year was 2012.
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
so the 2012
 
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:30.950 align:start position:0%
so the 2012
bill

01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
get my fingers to work again
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
the only other
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
point i'll
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
briefly make is
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
that the the fact that this is tied
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
um to parenting time could result in a
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
delay of child support orders or
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
multiple revisions of child support
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
orders as the parenting time is
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
determined in stages
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
so it just adds to the potential for
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
litigation the the sort of tied to
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
parenting time very specifically
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
creates a scenario where there's likely
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
to be a new area of an adversarial
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
relationship of the parties and i do you
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
know we are concerned anytime there's an
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
increase in the potential of an
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
adversarial relationship in family
 
01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.310 align:start position:0%
adversarial relationship in family
division

01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
has a negative impact on the overall
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
outcomes of those cases so i do just
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
point out that that tie at least raises
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
some concerns of a potential area of
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
adversarial relationships because it
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
then becomes very specifically tied to
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
child support and with that i'd be happy
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions are there any
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
questions for mr head
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you mr
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
head for taking my question
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
with regards to what you the last
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
statement you just made about tying um
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
these formulas to parenting time and my
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
i had a question before that
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
um that's defined as overnights
 
01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
um that's defined as overnights
and

01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
is there i recall that we had some
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
discussions about what the term
 
01:46:17.199 --> 01:46:18.550 align:start position:0%
discussions about what the term
overnights

01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
overnights
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
meant and
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
when does overnight begin
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
like how is that deter what how is that
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
a legal definition so
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
um and i i don't know the answer i did
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
not specifically research that ahead of
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
time i don't believe it's defined in
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
statute and and i've now looked it up in
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
any further questions no thank you
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you okay so
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the um public hearing
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1647

national legacy that has
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
made the respect for individual rights a
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
bedrock principle and commitment of our
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
american republic
 
02:02:37.109 --> 02:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
indeed as you will recall at the very
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
founding of our nation we declared
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
we hold these truths to be self-evident
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
that all men are created equal that they
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
are endowed by their creator with
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
certain unalienable rights
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
and in the very next sentence it is
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
further declared that to secure these
 
02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:57.350 align:start position:0%
further declared that to secure these
rights

02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
governments are instituted
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
to secure the rights
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
please note that the role of government
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
and of each one of us as elected
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
representatives of the people and
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
legislators is to secure rights that may
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
be otherwise threatened by accident or
 
02:03:15.199 --> 02:03:17.750 align:start position:0%
be otherwise threatened by accident or
design

02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
not long after our national constitution
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
was ratified it became clear to a
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
majority that it ought to be amended to
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
secure certain individual rights
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
the first ten amendments
 
02:03:31.149 --> 02:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
ratified and made effective december 15
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
1791 have become known by generations
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
of american school children as the bill
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
of rights
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
through the ensuing decades we have
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
striven to form a more perfect union
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
often doing so by enacting
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
new laws that we have come to believe
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
are securing even more individual rights
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
and freedoms
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
one such example
 
02:03:57.430 --> 02:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
of a more recently recognized and
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
enacted law is our state's patience
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
bill of rights and responsibilities
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
a copy of which
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
i am holding before you in my hand
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
it was enacted in 1981
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
and has since been amended several times
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
we in new hampshire enjoy a uniform set
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
of rights and responsibilities that
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
people can know
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
utilize and rely upon whenever and
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
wherever we may be admitted to a health
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
care treatment facility in 1981 we came
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
to realize that we needed such a law and
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
i believe the time has come in 2022 to
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
recognize that we now need a parent's
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
bill of rights
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
to make clear the will of the people of
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
that parents have certain unalienable
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
rights with respect to the care of their
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%

02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%

02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
to their educations and health care
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
these historic rights that have been
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledged across many cultures the
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
world around
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%

02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
threat in our country
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
hence the need to redress the imbalances
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
and outright expressions of obstruction
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
and refusal to honor once what was once
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%

02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
an established and integral role

question
on

02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
in your amended version
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
the right of a parent
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
participate in parent-teacher
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
associations and organizations that are

department of education
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
um is that referring to like a pta or
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
a pto what what is that referring to
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes that's how i would interpret that
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
so by saying um that that any parent can
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
an exception in here anywhere for sex
 
02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:20.310 align:start position:0%
an exception in here anywhere for sex
offenders

02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
no not that i'm aware of thank you
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative petrigno
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the bill
 
02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:35.189 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the bill
and

02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
many of the enumerated rights as far as
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
i can see
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
exist in state law or are a matter of
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
many school district policies but the
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
one that i'm focused on
 
02:09:46.639 --> 02:09:47.430 align:start position:0%
one that i'm focused on
is

02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
the right of a parent to exempt his or
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
her minor child from immunizations now
 
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
beyond the current exemptions for
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
medical and religious reasons
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not aware of uh of what the
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
answer to that question would be i don't
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
know i don't know okay thank you but
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
what it does sir is it codifies this
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
within this particular law
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
so that it's right there for anyone who
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
is seeking to know what all of the
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
rights are
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh it may be pursuant to another rsa and
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
if in fact it is
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
then we have missed it so far and
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully in your work session you'll
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
pick it up thank you may i have a quick
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up madam chair follow up okay so
 
02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
the reason for my question
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
is because uh many uh medical experts
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
pediatricians and so forth would
 
02:10:40.069 --> 02:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
recommend immunizations as we currently
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
have them for polio chicken parks dip
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
the area so forth and so on and there's
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
part of this legislation that goes on to
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
say that this section does not authorize
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
a parent of a minor child
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
in this state to engage in any conduct
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
that may be neglectful to the minor
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
child would you say that not
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
immuno-immunizing children going into
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
school would be
 
02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:05.599 align:start position:0%
neglectful and if that's the case
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't those two parts of this
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
legislation avoid
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
one another
 
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
personally i view that as a very
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
personal decision and an individual
 
02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
personal decision and an individual
right

02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
that view may not be shared by all
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%

02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
is there an exception in here
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere that i can't find
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
not that i'm aware of
 
02:11:47.109 --> 02:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
in your work session you may want to
 
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
consider such an addition
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative no further
 
02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:53.430 align:start position:0%
thank you representative no further
questions

02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you

thank you madam chair thank you
representative

02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
with reviewing this i
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
i noticed a lot of the language is
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
singular and this this committee knows
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
all too well when both parents don't
 
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.109 align:start position:0%
all too well when both parents don't
agree

02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
on something so how
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
how does this reflect on if one parent
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
is in favor of something which gives
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
them their right and the other parent
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
has that same right but opposed to it is
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
there any language in here that
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
identifies that scenario i mean this
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
this bill assumes that both parents are
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
are on the same page
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
and this committee finds that
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's not often the case
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
so so is there
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:12:44.550 --> 02:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
both parents will have that right
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
and how does that work
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh this is just off the top of my head
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
but i would say that
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
that's something that would have to be
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
interpreted and adjudicated unless it's
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
actually specified within the statute i
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
don't know what florida's experience has
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
been with respect to the singular plural
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
question that you are posing
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
there has been no challenge to that law
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
based on the question that you have
 
02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:16.629 align:start position:0%
based on the question that you have
asked

02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
asked
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
good question okay and i hope the
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
committee will consider that
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
in its uh in its deliberations on on the
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
language of this bill okay thank you
 
02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.030 align:start position:0%
language of this bill okay thank you
welcome

02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative terry for taking my
 
02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:39.510 align:start position:0%
representative terry for taking my
question

02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
um i think i'm on the i'm i'm on the
 
02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
if there is a change in my in the
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
with what my question is then i'll go to
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
but i'm looking at page five at the end
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
parental consent for health care
 
02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:00.470 align:start position:0%
parental consent for health care
services

02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
my first question and i would like a
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up is ex is on is lines eight
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
through ten except as otherwise provided
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
by law
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
or a court order a health care provider
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
may not allow a medical procedure to be
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
performed on a minor child in its
 
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
facility without first obtaining
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
written parental consent is
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
i mean we often look at bills and
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
in this committee with with an eye
 
02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
towards fixing problems is there a
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
problem in new hampshire with
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
health care providers
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
doing medical procedures on children
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
without their parents knowing about it
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
and how are they how are they paying for
 
02:14:42.239 --> 02:14:43.750 align:start position:0%
and how are they how are they paying for
that

02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
how is that how is that manifesting in
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that we need to put that
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
i believe that there are others who can
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
speak to that question specifically but
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
i am aware
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking that the answer to your
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
question is yes
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
and by containing this language we would
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
seek to preempt any future problems
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
but your aunt the answer to your
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
question is yes and i believe one of the
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh representatives who will speak
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
subsequently um
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
can answer that question and if he does
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
not in his testimony please be sure to
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
raise that question again with him
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
and he'll give you specifics thank you
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
i may have a follow-up madam chair
 
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:29.510 align:start position:0%
i may have a follow-up madam chair
follow-up

02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
back on that exact
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
on that section parental consent
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the first section one except as
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise provided by law
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
a health care practitioner or an
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
individual employed by such health care
 
02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.229 align:start position:0%
individual employed by such health care
practitioner

02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
may not provide
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
or solicit or arrange to provide health
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
care services or prescribe medicinal
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
drugs to a minor child without first
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
obtaining written parental consent so
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
under the provide solicit
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
are you saying that for instance in
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
high schools and libraries and other
 
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
places where
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
young people congregate and public
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
health officials want to get information
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
to them about health care services and
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
how to keep themselves
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
safe and healthy
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
that we would not be able to put up
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
posters that would tell
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
students about their ability to access
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
certain health
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
health care on their own
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question first i'm
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly where you are
 
02:16:44.549 --> 02:16:44.559 align:start position:0%
um i'm not hearing you clearly page five
 
02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
line six page five yep line six
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
a school employee that is not a teacher
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
in the original bill on the original
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
bill i'm sorry um i do not have the
 
02:16:56.790 --> 02:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
original bill in front of me right now
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
but listening to your question
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
i think the question that i'm hearing
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
was framed in terms of consent
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
and you're asking about the providing of
 
02:17:06.399 --> 02:17:07.990 align:start position:0%
and you're asking about the providing of
information

02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
so there is a clear distinction between
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
providing information and giving consent
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
and if if the language to which you are
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
referencing is about providing consent
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
then that that's different than
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
providing in for public health
 
02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:28.469 align:start position:0%
providing in for public health
information

02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
which is fine
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm all for providing any kind of
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
information and then
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
each parent
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
can contest that with respect to its
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
truthfulness and it's applicability
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answers
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
so i have one more question
 
02:17:57.200 --> 02:17:59.589 align:start position:0%
so i have one more question
um

02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
in in on your amendment on page three
 
02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:05.349 align:start position:0%
in in on your amendment on page three
um

02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
line 20 the right of a parent to enroll
 
02:18:09.990 --> 02:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
his or her minor child in gifted or
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
special education programs if the child
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
qualifies for such programs
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
would it be the school that determines
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
and and if so if the school doesn't have
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
a gifted program in new hampshire we
 
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot of small schools
 
02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
have a lot of small schools
uh

02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
what would they be forced to provide
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
transportation to another district for
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question and if i
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
was the person who was interpreting this
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
law this bill if it would be enacted
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
into law
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
i would i would interpret this in such a
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
way is to say
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
that the school district in and of
 
02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
that the school district in and of
itself

02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
is not required to provide that program
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
but to find a way to provide that
 
02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
program to that child even if it meant
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
having the child participate in that
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
program in a neighboring district which
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
is incidentally what happened with my
 
02:19:09.599 --> 02:19:10.549 align:start position:0%
is incidentally what happened with my
own

02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:19:10.559 --> 02:19:11.750 align:start position:0%
own
son

02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
son

it was called a gifted program at the

time and so the school had to find
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
a place where he could receive

four through five it says the state
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me all parents rights are
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
reserved to the
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
parent of a minor in the state without
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
obstruction or interference from the
 
02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
obstruction or interference from the
state

02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
would you say that also would include
 
02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:19.190 align:start position:0%
would you say that also would include
dcyf

02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
so representative you are you're
 
02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:22.710 align:start position:0%
so representative you are you're
referring

02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
referring
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
you're referencing the language all
 
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
parental rights are reserved to the
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
parent of a minor minor child in this
 
02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
state without obstruction or
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
interference from the state
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes and you're asking does the state
 
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
include dcyf that's correct
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
the way i read the sentence sir is that
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
all parental rights are reserved to the
 
02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:46.790 align:start position:0%
all parental rights are reserved to the
parent

02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
without obstruction or interference from
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
now if subsequently a child is taken
 
02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:54.710 align:start position:0%
now if subsequently a child is taken
from

02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
by court action is taken from his or her
 
02:20:59.429 --> 02:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
parent or parents home
 
02:20:59.439 --> 02:21:00.230 align:start position:0%
parent or parents home
then

02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
the responsibility is
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
is necessarily transferred to the state
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
agency or the entity that has assumed
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
at least temporary supervision of the
 
02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:13.349 align:start position:0%
at least temporary supervision of the
child

02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up matter i should have been a
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
judge follow-up
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for responding so that's not
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
the way that i would interpret that
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
the way that i would okay we're going to
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
have a question not a debate if you're a
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
patient madam chair i'll get to my
 
02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:31.910 align:start position:0%
patient madam chair i'll get to my
question

02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:33.429 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:33.439 --> 02:21:34.389 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's not the way that i read it so
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
if you go into the next page of the
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
it states that a parent of a minor child
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
in the state has inalienable rights that
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
are more comprehensive than those listed
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
in this section unless such rights have
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
been legally waived or terminated
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
this chapter does not prescribe all
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
rights to a parent of a minor child in
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
this state unless required by law the
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
patient excuse me the rights of a parent
 
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
of a minor child in this state may not
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
be limited to or denied this chapter may
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
not be construct construed to apply to a
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
parental action or decision that would
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
end in life
 
02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:14.710 align:start position:0%
end in life
so

02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:17.429 --> 02:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
i see conflicts
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
with this section
 
02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:21.030 align:start position:0%
with this section
and

02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
the the um the rights to
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
remove a child from care do you not see
 
02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:28.950 align:start position:0%
remove a child from care do you not see
those

02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
concerns in that in between those two
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
sections i appreciate your
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
your concern i appreciate your question
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
desire for for clarity or
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
the desire to eliminate ambiguity or
 
02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:45.990 align:start position:0%
the desire to eliminate ambiguity or
conflict

02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
but as i read section four on page two
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i read section one on page one i see
 
02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:54.790 align:start position:0%
and i read section one on page one i see
no

02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see any conflict at this time
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
but rather that
 
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
section one is interpreted
 
02:23:04.870 --> 02:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
by the more specific language in section
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
four on page two
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
so i don't see that conflict i'll have
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
to really take a look at that and
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
consider more seriously what you're
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
saying and i hope your committee will as
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%

that would end life
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
what is this referring to
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
that section
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
in that particular item
 
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
2b is exclusionary
 
02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:52.110 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
02:24:52.110 --> 02:24:54.830 align:start position:0%
and therefore
[Music]

02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%

section
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
if you're asking what what is meant by
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
ending life uh that that that is a
 
02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:14.150 align:start position:0%
ending life uh that that that is a
question

02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
that is subject to interpretation
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
once the law is passed unless there is
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
further elaboration and explanation by
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
what is meant by end of life
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
and that's the committee's job
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
with all due respect
 
02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:30.469 align:start position:0%
with all due respect
follow-up

02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:25:30.479 --> 02:25:31.670 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to debate abortion
 
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
she has a right to ask questions
 
02:25:39.270 --> 02:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
well certainly
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
i was concluding my answer
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
is that permitted ma'am
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
i wanted to conclude my answer i i
 
02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
thought of something additional to say
 
02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
before someone else was recognized thank
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
you actually answered my follow-up
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
asking what
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
would end life is that referring to a
 
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
child or is that referring to abortion
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
so you answered my question thank you
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
very much or
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
the child
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
i i believe that the
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
plain meaning
 
02:26:19.990 --> 02:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
of life would mean
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
a child
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
who is already existing
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.720 --> 02:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%

02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:38.550 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is a follow-up
to

02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%

madam chair's question
on

02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
concerning

02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:47.750 align:start position:0%
concerning
the

02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:50.150 align:start position:0%
the
gifted

02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
gifted
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
children and
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
if a parent
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
chooses to
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
enroll their child in gifted programs
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
in their public school who pays the
 
02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:04.469 align:start position:0%
in their public school who pays the
tuition

02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
02:27:04.479 --> 02:27:06.150 align:start position:0%
tuition
for

02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:06.950 align:start position:0%
for
the

02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:18.150 --> 02:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
so i would neces the starting point for
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
me if i was in a position as a school
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
administrator would be do we have a
 
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
gifted program if we don't have a gifted
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
program and the child qualifies for a
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
gifted program then we need to find a
 
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
gifted program for the child if the
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
gifted program that is found by the
 
02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
school administration for the child
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
is one with which the parent disagrees
 
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
and wishes another gifted program
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
it seems to me since it would be the
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
school district that is paying for
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
the gifted child a program for that
 
02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:50.950 align:start position:0%
the gifted child a program for that
child

02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:27:54.070 --> 02:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
that the decision as to which gifted
 
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
program and i would hope there'd be a
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
conversation here between the parent and
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
the school district that in fact it
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
would be a decision of the school
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
administration as to which gifted
 
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
program were to be offered because the
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
word here is not programs there's no
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
specification that the right extends to
 
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
the parent to choose one among many
 
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's how i read that i hope that's
 
02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:23.349 align:start position:0%
that's how i read that i hope that's
helpful

02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
i won't continue the questions thank you
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:37.910 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:38.950 align:start position:0%
 
in

02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
kind of following along uh
 
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative grossman's line of
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
questioning um
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh the the phrase that would end life is
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
not restricted to type of life and so
 
02:28:55.270 --> 02:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
there is um
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's a question about would this
 
02:28:58.080 --> 02:28:59.349 align:start position:0%
there's a question about would this
um

02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
i think i'm
 
02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:01.910 align:start position:0%
i think i'm
uh

02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:03.910 align:start position:0%
uh
would

02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:29:07.270 --> 02:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
it be more clear as to not prohibit
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
things like fishing and stuff like um
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
things that may be
 
02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
done on farms and stuff like that so
 
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
um teach their kids in the uh about
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
those activities
 
02:29:30.150 --> 02:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
and and even participate in fishing and
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um i'm sorry um
 
02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at section two this section
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
reference was made to end life
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how you got to fishing
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
were you suggesting that that there
 
02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting that fishing can cause in
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
the end of the life of the fish
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm i'm suggesting that
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
fishing can
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
cause the end of the life of the fish
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
and so therefore
 
02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
is causing the end of the life
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore this phrase would you
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
believe is too broad and should be
 
02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
believe is too broad and should be
um

02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
i see so so what would be helpful uh by
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
what i think you're inferring
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
or decision that would end
 
02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:29.429 --> 02:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
whatever clarification you you believe
 
02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
is is appropriate i'm just was asking if
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
the clarification you believe was
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you
 
02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you
yes

02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
i would say you could
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
help you could be helpful here
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
to any who would have questions about
 
02:30:47.349 --> 02:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
how to interpret this should this become
 
02:30:47.359 --> 02:30:48.389 align:start position:0%
how to interpret this should this become
law

02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
by including the phrase
 
02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:51.750 align:start position:0%
by including the phrase
or

02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
modifying that phrase such that it would
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
read that would end
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative altschiller
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
final question um i'm looking at the
 
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
two things specifically um i'm reading
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
through your amendment and
 
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
on page four lines 31-36
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh outline how a parent
 
02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
who believes or claims that a violation
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
of any of the provisions in this
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
may bring an action for objective relief
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
and go straight to superior court
 
02:31:47.920 --> 02:31:48.790 align:start position:0%
and go straight to superior court
and

02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
so as a hypothetical i'm looking at page
 
02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.870 align:start position:0%
so as a hypothetical i'm looking at page
three

02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.990 --> 02:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
lines three section d
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know a parent who objects to having
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
any discussion about acquired immune
 
02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
deficiency syndrome
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
um has a child in a senior english sing
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
a senior lit class and is reading angels
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
in america
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
um so now their child has been exposed
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
to reading about
 
02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
acquired immune deficiency syndrome
 
02:32:28.469 --> 02:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
and now the parent can su according to
 
02:32:30.630 --> 02:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
this it looks like a parent can then
 
02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:31.670 align:start position:0%
this it looks like a parent can then
sue

02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
sue
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
because their child was exposed to
 
02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
is that is that how we're to read this
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
that any of these violations mean that
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
any parent could just
 
02:32:52.870 --> 02:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
whip straight to supreme court i mean to
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um
 
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
we were at the lob and i could actually
 
02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
spread this law out on the table the
 
02:33:04.399 --> 02:33:05.429 align:start position:0%
spread this law out on the table the
amendment

02:33:05.429 --> 02:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know i'm tossing papers here while
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
you're speaking
 
02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
i think i'm following your question
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
fairly accurately
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't see that as
 
02:33:15.359 --> 02:33:17.110 align:start position:0%
and i don't see that as
necessarily

02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
as a necessary consequence
 
02:33:21.429 --> 02:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
of adopting this language as it is
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
presented i i don't see that that would
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
require further i think discussion and
 
02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:30.150 align:start position:0%
require further i think discussion and
study

02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't unders
 
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
is that a follow-up follow-up i i don't
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
understand what you said
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's well it's just my distance
 
02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:46.230 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's well it's just my distance
but

02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i would like to wait until
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying you don't understand
 
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm saying perhaps i can't hear you
 
02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
because we're in this room that is
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
echoing i did not understand your answer
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
to my question that if a child who's
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
engaged in a 12th grade english class
 
02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:07.590 align:start position:0%
engaged in a 12th grade english class
reads

02:34:07.590 --> 02:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
reads
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
angels in america but their parents
 
02:34:13.270 --> 02:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
don't want them to have any education
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
about acquired immune deficiency
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
syndrome as outlined in section d on
 
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
page three
 
02:34:21.429 --> 02:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
it appears
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
that in section
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
by under violations part two that they
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
can then sue
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
the school board school district and sau
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
in superior court and i wonder i want to
 
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
know if that is
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
if that was considered and do you
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
understand that that is
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
that what the what the ramifications
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
well once again uh representative
 
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
thinking off the top of my head with
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
respect to a specific hypothetical
 
02:34:54.399 --> 02:34:55.510 align:start position:0%
respect to a specific hypothetical
incident

02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
incident
 
02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
that you are describing it would seem to
 
02:34:58.160 --> 02:34:58.870 align:start position:0%
that you are describing it would seem to
me

02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
that the path of least resistance would
 
02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:01.990 align:start position:0%
that the path of least resistance would
be

02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
in conversation between the school
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
authority and the parents and the parent
 
02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:09.349 align:start position:0%
authority and the parents and the parent
expressing

02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
expressing
 
02:35:09.359 --> 02:35:10.230 align:start position:0%
expressing
that

02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
the parent does not wish the child to
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
read that particular book about that
 
02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
particular condition
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
that to avoid any unnecessary litigation
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
the easiest so the the easiest indicated
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
solution would be that the student would
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
be exempted from being required to read
 
02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
that particular book that the parent
 
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
found offensive
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
for the reason that the parent specified
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the school authority
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
rather than to immediately litigate
 
02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
are you outside representative
 
02:35:50.399 --> 02:35:51.590 align:start position:0%

speak in support of the bill for five
minutes

02:36:13.349 --> 02:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%

i

02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
submitted um three packets to all of you
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
i hope you all got them
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's two of them
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
that i like to explain and why i support
 
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
is the diversity inclusion and the
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
gingerbread person
 
02:36:45.270 --> 02:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
these two trainings
 
02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
were done to our school district as a
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
whole staff training
 
02:36:53.910 --> 02:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
it took me weeks to get copies of these
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
not only am i a parent in this school
 
02:36:57.990 --> 02:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
district in my in laconia school
 
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
district but i am also a school board
 
02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:01.670 align:start position:0%
district but i am also a school board
member

02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
member
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
it was horrifying to know that it took
 
02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
me weeks
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get this information as to how
 
02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
and what our teachers and staff were
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
being trained on
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
and to find out that this information is
 
02:37:16.710 --> 02:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
what we're being taught to our teachers
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
to teach our kids
 
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
was horrifying to me this is these are
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
my children i gave birth to them
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
nobody else
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
and when someone tells me that in here
 
02:37:34.469 --> 02:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
that no one is allowed to tell me if my
 
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
child identifies as a man or a woman or
 
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
other ones and they have no right
 
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
and they're saying that they cannot tell
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
me as a parent that's how my child's
 
02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:45.750 align:start position:0%
me as a parent that's how my child's
feeling

02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
feeling
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
how does that help a problem
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
that only makes a problem worse for the
 
02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:54.710 align:start position:0%
that only makes a problem worse for the
child

02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so when i saw that in this paperwork
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
i was horrified that that's what they
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
were teaching these teachers to tell my
 
02:38:06.070 --> 02:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
i gave birth to them i put food on their
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
table i put a roof over their head i cry
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
them this i
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
walk them to sleep when they've been
 
02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:14.870 align:start position:0%
walk them to sleep when they've been
sick

02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
sick
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
no government has ever
 
02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:18.630 align:start position:0%
no government has ever
and

02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:20.070 --> 02:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
will never
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
take my rights as a parent away if i
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't want my child to know something
 
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
that is my right if my child needs to be
 
02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:30.309 align:start position:0%
that is my right if my child needs to be
taught

02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
taught
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
an educational piece that is not being
 
02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
taught in the school i can do that
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
the school's
 
02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:39.270 align:start position:0%
the school's
purpose

02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
is to teach
 
02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
science math
 
02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
reading and social studies and when the

deficiency ratings in our school
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
districts are 67 percent on average when

you take reading math and science and
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
you average them out
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
67 deficient i'm sorry but that is
 
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
unacceptable on any level
 
02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:08.070 align:start position:0%

it took parents
 
02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
multiple times of contacting the
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent to have this removed it
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%

02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of april and ended and they
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%

02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
i know of a student who sat through a
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
zoom class last year
 
02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
when a teacher
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the top with the subject they she
 
02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
was teaching
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
incited a riot with the kids to go
 
02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
protest somebody's home
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
she only did it as she said as a joke
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
but got the kids going wanting to go egg
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
the person's house and attack the people
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
little did they know the person they
 
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
were talking about
 
02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
were talking about
was

02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
the parent of one of the child sitting
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:31.030 --> 02:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
i was horrified
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
as a parent to hear that and i was also
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
horrified as a school board member
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
and when the complaint was made at the
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
school level and at the department of ed
 
02:40:45.030 --> 02:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
and an investigation was done and
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's child has no idea what
 
02:40:50.469 --> 02:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
repercussions this teacher got
 
02:40:50.479 --> 02:40:51.670 align:start position:0%
repercussions this teacher got
nothing

02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
so now that child believes doesn't
 
02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
matter what you do consequences don't
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
have actions i'm sorry i don't know
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
about any about anybody anybody in this
 
02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
room but when i teach my child there's a
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
consequence to everything you do it
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
could be good it could be bad but when
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
you do something that
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
hurts and it threatens somebody's life
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
and no adult is hold you accountable
 
02:41:18.870 --> 02:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
that is disgraceful on every level
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
department of ed to the school district
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
this child does not
 
02:41:27.269 --> 02:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
feel that she was justified
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
to know what happened to this teacher
 
02:41:31.830 --> 02:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
when she caused tried to cause a riot
 
02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
and this person had to turn around and
 
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
have police
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
watch their home for two months
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
every hour because of the threats that
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
were made
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
through this teacher and throughout the
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
community and i'm sorry but it's
 
02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:49.510 align:start position:0%
community and i'm sorry but it's
outrageous

outrageous
 
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
and it is time to take back our rights
 
02:41:53.910 --> 02:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
as parents and i will fight to the end
 
02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%

normally my favorite question as a
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
political activist
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
is who is in charge what is the proper
 
02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
role of government what is it supposed
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
here

02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
we don't know who is in charge
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
school board seemed and staff seem to be
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
believing that they are in charge of our
 
02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:36.950 align:start position:0%
believing that they are in charge of our
children

02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
it is needed because they shouldn't be
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
even though
 
02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
the proper rule of
 
02:44:45.590 --> 02:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
gov the proper role of government is one
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%

02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
superseded by
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
follow the law
 
02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
which i don't believe our school systems
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
he is now in kindergarten
 
02:45:00.870 --> 02:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
and now he is subject to what is going
 
02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
and now he is subject to what is going
on

02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%

did i covered an event in moultonborough
 
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
in which there was much discussion in
 
02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
the community where a bunch of activists
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
from dartmouth wanted to come in for a
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
weekend long program with the kids in
 
02:45:21.670 --> 02:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
the mountain boroughs high school
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
the problem was that parents were
 
02:45:25.110 --> 02:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
objecting that there were two different
 
02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:26.389 align:start position:0%
objecting that there were two different
sessions

02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
02:45:26.399 --> 02:45:27.190 align:start position:0%
sessions
that

02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
they were not allowed to watch or
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
participate in and they said like a lot
 
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
of parents today
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
we are supposed to be in charge
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
not you
 
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
and one teacher stood up and said
 
02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
you don't know what you're talking about
 
02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
your kids know more than you do
 
02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
because we've taught them that
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
that was the first time i ran into the
 
02:45:54.710 --> 02:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
idea that teachers and staff are trying
 
02:45:57.590 --> 02:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
to separate parents from their children
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
and they were very blatant about it and
 
02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's only gotten worse
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
my daughter-in-law or soon-to-be
 
02:46:03.279 --> 02:46:04.710 align:start position:0%
my daughter-in-law or soon-to-be
daughter-in-law

02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law
 
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
has a degree in special ed her
 
02:46:08.830 --> 02:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
professors kept telling her
 
02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
verbatim don't trust the parents
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's another slice at separating
 
02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
children from parents
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
i can tell you a number of nationwide
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
in buena vista
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
actually hold on to that just a second
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
the school boards
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
across the nation
 
02:46:37.990 --> 02:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
are refusing to be held accountable to
 
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:39.110 align:start position:0%
are refusing to be held accountable to
parents

02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
voters and taxpayers
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
i have a phrase for that as they sit in
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
their public meetings they act like they
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
are the easter island stow-faced
 
02:46:51.030 --> 02:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
stone-faced moa statues
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
during public comment they refuse to
 
02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:53.910 align:start position:0%
during public comment they refuse to
answer

02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
they refuse to comment
 
02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes
 
02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
look rather disinterested yet these are
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to be our elected
 
02:47:04.630 --> 02:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
representatives to be held accountable
 
02:47:06.070 --> 02:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
according to article 8 of the new
 
02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
responsible to us
 
02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
freely accessible and transparent and
 
02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
they refuse
 
02:47:15.670 --> 02:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is replicated not over not across
 
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
just districts here in new hampshire but
 
02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
nationwide if you've been watching the
 
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
news which i hope that you have been
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
parents are in an uproar and uprising
 
02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
against the school boards that
 
02:47:32.830 --> 02:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
dismiss their complaints dismiss
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
their questions dismissed that they
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
should even be there at all
 
02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
in fact here in my school district
 
02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
they have a policy replicated across
 
02:47:47.269 --> 02:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
other districts as well because they all
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
seem to come from the new hampshire
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
school board association
 
02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
that if i had a problem i would have to
 
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
go to a teacher then to the principal
 
02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
then to the superintendent
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
but there's no way in that policy to be
 
02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
able to reach a school board
 
02:48:05.429 --> 02:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
and yet here i was complaining about a
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
specific policy that they had just put
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
into place
 
02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
my grandson was not in school at that
 
02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:13.349 align:start position:0%
my grandson was not in school at that
time

02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:48:15.910 --> 02:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
i had no way to access the school board
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
i had no way to get feedback
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's not right
 
02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed in part because of
 
02:48:24.319 --> 02:48:27.750 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed in part because of
that

02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
another policy that seems to be coming
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
in and where i really have most of my
 
02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:33.990 align:start position:0%
in and where i really have most of my
problems

02:48:33.990 --> 02:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
is policy jab again from the new
 
02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire school board association
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
i am suing
 
02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
the guilford school board over two
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
precepts in that policy
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
one it coerces speech
 
02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
now policy jab is also called
 
02:48:54.309 --> 02:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
transgender non-conforming students and
 
02:48:56.070 --> 02:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
in it there is
 
02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
a codicil that says a transgender
 
02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
student has the right to be called by
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
their preferred name and pronouns
 
02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
well let's translate that please
 
02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
we are a dylan's right state no
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the state can do anything
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
that it wants unless you folks in the
 
02:49:15.910 --> 02:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legislature legislature
 
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
has given them the power within the
 
02:49:20.309 --> 02:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
state statute
 
02:49:20.319 --> 02:49:21.269 align:start position:0%
state statute
so

02:49:21.269 --> 02:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
where does this subdivision of the state
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
a school board
 
02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
given the power
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
to grant a new right to a minor child to
 
02:49:33.429 --> 02:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
coerce the speech of others
 
02:49:35.349 --> 02:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
i have asked this for a year and a half
 
02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
of my school board they sit there
 
02:49:40.710 --> 02:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
stone-faced i have
 
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
entered in
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
rsa 91 right to no demands no answers i
 
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
email them no answers i go on knock on
 
02:49:50.230 --> 02:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
doors no answers
 
02:49:52.389 --> 02:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
they are completely unaccountable
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
because that is blatantly illegal not
 
02:49:57.670 --> 02:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
only by the us constitution freedom of
 
02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
speech but also article 22 and a little
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
bit of article 30 in the new hampshire
 
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
constitution and yet there's nothing i
 
02:50:07.590 --> 02:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
can do except sue
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
then the worst thing which
 
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative terry brought up
 
02:50:13.830 --> 02:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
lying to parents
 
02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
there is a privacy part
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
where this this district has given
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
themselves the power to lie
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
by omission
 
02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
or commission
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
to parents about the transgender student
 
02:50:28.319 --> 02:50:29.030 align:start position:0%
to parents about the transgender student
the

02:50:29.030 --> 02:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
transgender status of a student who
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
happens to be that parent's child they
 
02:50:36.550 --> 02:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
will refuse to tell
 
02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
that parent what is going on at the most
 
02:50:39.439 --> 02:50:40.790 align:start position:0%
that parent what is going on at the most
in

02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:50:44.309 --> 02:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
developmental age of a child
 
02:50:47.190 --> 02:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
and to keep the parent away
 
02:50:49.990 --> 02:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
sequestered from that information
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
and yet the parent is responsible if bad
 
02:50:54.950 --> 02:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
things happen
 
02:50:57.110 --> 02:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
my grandson suffers from a number of
 
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
different things
 
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
if he was to go transgender
 
02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
i would never know
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
i would never know that he has problems
 
02:51:07.349 --> 02:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
i would never know that this could
 
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
complicate the ones that he already has
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
but the staff feels good about
 
02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:13.670 align:start position:0%
but the staff feels good about
themselves

02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:51:16.150 --> 02:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
they've gone woke
 
02:51:18.389 --> 02:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to put it that way in
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
buena vista california there were two
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
teachers at a conference that boasted
 
02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
about how they hid
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
their transgender clubs after school
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
from both parents and other staff
 
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
members with the staff kind of just
 
02:51:34.870 --> 02:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:34.880 --> 02:51:35.910 align:start position:0%
 
they

02:51:35.910 --> 02:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:51:39.030 --> 02:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
basically saw themselves as missionaries
 
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
they turned not more than a few peop
 
02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
more than a few students to be
 
02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:46.070 align:start position:0%
more than a few students to be
transgender

02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
02:51:48.870 --> 02:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
one parent finally found out about it by
 
02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:50.230 align:start position:0%
one parent finally found out about it by
accident

02:51:50.230 --> 02:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
accident
 
02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
now that school board is being sued
 
02:51:55.990 --> 02:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
12 imagine that 12 year old turns to
 
02:51:58.710 --> 02:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
transgender and they won't tell the
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
parent even when asked they are
 
02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
instructed use their birth name use
 
02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
their birth sex or gender by the way
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
gender is just a more genteel way from
 
02:52:14.070 --> 02:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
the latest one that just came out was a
 
02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
story out of georgia
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
where 12 year old was found hanging in
 
02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
the bathroom on her second suicide
 
02:52:23.279 --> 02:52:24.309 align:start position:0%
the bathroom on her second suicide
attempt

02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
02:52:25.990 --> 02:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
after the counselors in that school
 
02:52:29.269 --> 02:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
system were counseling her oh you feel
 
02:52:33.429 --> 02:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
like a boy you must be transgender
 
02:52:37.429 --> 02:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
and the parents were never told
 
02:52:39.190 --> 02:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
is this the kind of school system that
 
02:52:40.870 --> 02:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
we need
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
and you look and say
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe a parent's bill of right so
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
that we get full information
 
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
from school boards that the parents are
 
02:52:53.269 --> 02:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
in charge are there
 
02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
school boards essentially believe that
 
02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
all parents are guilty why else would
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
they lie again by commission or omission
 
02:53:03.030 --> 02:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
to parents about certain things about
 
02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
their children in school
 
02:53:07.269 --> 02:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
they are acting like
 
02:53:10.469 --> 02:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
they are in charge that they are the
 
02:53:10.479 --> 02:53:11.910 align:start position:0%
they are in charge that they are the
parents

02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that's not the new hampshire
 
02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:15.590 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that's not the new hampshire
way

02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's sad that this bill is even
 
02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:19.429 align:start position:0%
it's it's sad that this bill is even
needed

02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
that we have to clarify
 
02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
that the parents are supposed to be
 
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
preeminent in the raising of their
 
02:53:28.950 --> 02:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
children and how they are educated
 
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
remember government is supposed to work
 
02:53:33.349 --> 02:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:53:36.389 --> 02:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
we hire the teachers and the districts
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
to stand in our stead to raise them to
 
02:53:39.279 --> 02:53:40.550 align:start position:0%
to stand in our stead to raise them to
learn

02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
learn
 
02:53:43.269 --> 02:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
reading writing arithmetic and all that
 
02:53:45.030 --> 02:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
other stuff and yet when you look at the
 
02:53:48.309 --> 02:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
standardized tests overall
 
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does very well
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
but the percentage of students that are
 
02:53:55.190 --> 02:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
not proficient in those subjects
 
02:53:56.870 --> 02:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
is rather poor
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
what's needed even more is that this
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill is just a stepping stone to force
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
school boards to follow the law the laws
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
that are already on the books and not
 
02:54:12.389 --> 02:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
take actions or give themselves the
 
02:54:12.399 --> 02:54:13.269 align:start position:0%
take actions or give themselves the
power

02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
power
 
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
to things that they are not entitled
 
02:54:17.670 --> 02:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
because you folks have not given it to
 
02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:19.510 align:start position:0%
because you folks have not given it to
them

02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%

02:56:02.950 --> 02:56:02.960 align:start position:0%

mark but i ask you to keep it brief
 
02:56:09.030 --> 02:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people signed up no
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
problem i'll try leanne romano
 
02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
litchfield um
 
02:56:14.550 --> 02:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
i have to say i can't believe we're here
 
02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:19.269 align:start position:0%
i have to say i can't believe we're here
actually

02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
having to have a bill
 
02:56:23.429 --> 02:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:56:25.349 --> 02:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
i thought that the birth certificate
 
02:56:28.230 --> 02:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
that has my husband's name and my name
 
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
was the documentation needed
 
02:56:33.429 --> 02:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
for me to have my parental rights and
 
02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that i have taken care of my
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
three children
 
02:56:38.389 --> 02:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
and their
 
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
i really support this particular
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill because
 
02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
it is beginning to be
 
02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
the staff and teachers versus
 
02:56:54.630 --> 02:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
the parents and the parents are not
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
looking to be enemies we're looking to
 
02:56:57.910 --> 02:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
work with them
 
02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
i have had a great relationship for 25
 
02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
years with all my children and
 
02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
litchfield teachers and the school board
 
02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
and whatever
 
02:57:09.110 --> 02:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
02:57:10.950 --> 02:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
people are changing now people are
 
02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
retiring they don't want to deal with
 
02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
parents so on and so forth i get it
 
02:57:18.230 --> 02:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
people can get really heated but we have
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
to have something in place that makes us
 
02:57:24.950 --> 02:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
in charge i do not ever want to
 
02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
ever see
 
02:57:29.190 --> 02:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
that somebody accidentally vaccinated my
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
child because the name was similar like
 
02:57:34.469 --> 02:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
i've seen i don't want to see somebody
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
else's child getting coaxed hey we'll
 
02:57:40.870 --> 02:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
give you pizza just shh don't tell mommy
 
02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
and daddy no
 
02:57:45.750 --> 02:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
i've already expressed my concerns and
 
02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:46.870 align:start position:0%
i've already expressed my concerns and
views

02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
views
 
02:57:48.309 --> 02:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
with the school board with the
 
02:57:50.309 --> 02:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent they've assured me that
 
02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen
 
02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:52.950 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen
but

02:57:52.950 --> 02:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:57:55.510 --> 02:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
i see it happening out there not in my
 
02:57:57.910 --> 02:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
school not with my kids because i'm on
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
it but what it you know what about the
 
02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
parents that don't know
 
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
that they should be doing this and it
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
just because i send an email doesn't
 
02:58:05.279 --> 02:58:06.150 align:start position:0%
just because i send an email doesn't
mean

02:58:06.150 --> 02:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:58:06.160 --> 02:58:07.030 align:start position:0%
mean
that

02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to adhere to that
 
02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
there has to be something in place that
 
02:58:13.990 --> 02:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
says no we're not going to do this we're
 
02:58:15.670 --> 02:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
not going to do that we're not going to
 
02:58:18.309 --> 02:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
talk about that you have say in what is
 
02:58:20.150 --> 02:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
the curriculum
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
i've asked the health teacher what's the
 
02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
topics and she assured me what it was
 
02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
and you know i
 
02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
i went over it with her this is okay
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
that's not okay i'm getting messages
 
02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
from teachers
 
02:58:34.550 --> 02:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
this is the topic that we're going to be
 
02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
talking about do you agree or disagree i
 
02:58:40.389 --> 02:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
put my phone number in every email i
 
02:58:42.790 --> 02:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
don't want just a signed paper i want
 
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
you to talk to me because my kid can
 
02:58:47.429 --> 02:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
forge my signature and if i catch him
 
02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a problem but
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i want to know what's going on we
 
02:58:54.630 --> 02:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
should have something in place that
 
02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
that is a collaboration amongst the
 
02:58:59.269 --> 02:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
school the staff
 
02:59:00.550 --> 02:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
and the parents
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
where we can work together to get things
 
02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
in place and to go over the topics
 
02:59:07.830 --> 02:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's it's the place of
 
02:59:10.710 --> 02:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
anyone to go over someone's gender or
 
02:59:13.110 --> 02:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
their mental health status we have
 
02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
doctors i have counselors for my kids if
 
02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
they need it i have doctors for vaccines
 
02:59:21.990 --> 02:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
i don't like the the inference that
 
02:59:23.750 --> 02:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
well what if what if parents are
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
neglecting their duties by not
 
02:59:28.950 --> 02:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
immunizing or whatever i mean come on
 
02:59:31.190 --> 02:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
all of our kids are vaccinated if
 
02:59:32.950 --> 02:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
they're attending public schools
 
02:59:35.110 --> 02:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
typically unless they have an exemption
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:59:39.030 --> 02:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
we can discuss that with our own doctors
 
02:59:41.190 --> 02:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
there's only one vaccine if it's
 
02:59:42.870 --> 02:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually a vaccine
 
02:59:44.950 --> 02:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
that is in question right now
 
02:59:44.960 --> 02:59:45.990 align:start position:0%
that is in question right now
really

02:59:45.990 --> 02:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:47.110 align:start position:0%
really
um

02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:49.830 --> 02:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
i think you should support this bill
 
02:59:51.510 --> 02:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you need to change whatever you need
 
02:59:53.590 --> 02:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
to change you know to
 
02:59:55.510 --> 02:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
make it fit whatever
 
02:59:58.710 --> 02:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
fine we need rights parents need rights
 
03:00:02.309 --> 03:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
we absolutely need to have a say in the
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum we should be concentrating on
 
03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
their education not their social life
 
03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
not their social status or their
 
03:00:11.030 --> 03:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
activities or i mean it's great that
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
they have support staff
 
03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:14.309 align:start position:0%
they have support staff
but

03:00:14.309 --> 03:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:00:16.150 --> 03:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
we can just infor
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
inform us that there's an issue and we
 
03:00:19.910 --> 03:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
can take care of that on the side or
 
03:00:21.590 --> 03:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
work with the school
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
always inform always inform the parents
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
we're not animals we're the ones that
 
03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
birthed them please support the bill
 
03:00:35.110 --> 03:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
up next is alicia houston she's asked
 
03:00:41.830 --> 03:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
for three minutes to speak in support of
 
03:00:50.469 --> 03:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:51.590 --> 03:00:51.600 align:start position:0%

representatives and thank you for the
 
03:00:54.870 --> 03:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:55.750 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
um

03:00:55.750 --> 03:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
i am looking around this room and i'm
 
03:00:59.670 --> 03:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimonies i was going
 
03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
to write something down and then i
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
didn't so here i am in front of you
 
03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:05.510 align:start position:0%
didn't so here i am in front of you
communication

03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
communication
 
03:01:07.830 --> 03:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
and transparency
 
03:01:10.230 --> 03:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of what this has to do with
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
the communication barrier that parents
 
03:01:14.790 --> 03:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
are facing right now without this bill
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
in place
 
03:01:19.190 --> 03:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
is astounding i can tell you from
 
03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
specific experience i come from a city
 
03:01:23.910 --> 03:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
that many representatives unfortunately
 
03:01:26.150 --> 03:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
have left to eat itself
 
03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:27.670 align:start position:0%
have left to eat itself
nashua

03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
in nashua we have no rights as parents
 
03:01:35.190 --> 03:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
i i've asked for curriculum information
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
to find out what is being taught to my
 
03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:38.070 align:start position:0%
to find out what is being taught to my
children

03:01:38.070 --> 03:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
they will not disclose that i've sent in
 
03:01:43.110 --> 03:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
91a a right to no request they will not
 
03:01:45.590 --> 03:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
disclose that we've sent emails and
 
03:01:48.070 --> 03:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
phone calls and more emails and more
 
03:01:50.429 --> 03:01:50.439 align:start position:0%
phone calls we have been at this
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
relentlessly for two
 
03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:54.389 align:start position:0%
relentlessly for two
years

03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:01:56.070 --> 03:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
i'm exhausted
 
03:01:58.389 --> 03:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
i'm a tired mom trying to do what's best
 
03:02:01.110 --> 03:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
for my children this parents bill of
 
03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
rights would give me the opportunity to
 
03:02:05.510 --> 03:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
make decisions autonomously as their
 
03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:07.110 align:start position:0%
make decisions autonomously as their
mother

03:02:07.110 --> 03:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
mother
 
03:02:08.790 --> 03:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
and i know that earlier there had been a
 
03:02:11.349 --> 03:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
question to one of the representatives
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the specifics on what if the
 
03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
parents don't agree that's what the
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
court is for that's not what this bill
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
is for this bill is to give parents
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
their rights back we don't have rights
 
03:02:23.910 --> 03:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
right now we have a school board that is
 
03:02:26.389 --> 03:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
a dictatorship that makes the decisions
 
03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
for our children
 
03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
and another perfect example is i have a
 
03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
child with a medical exemption for the
 
03:02:33.269 --> 03:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
wearing of masks and the district won't
 
03:02:34.389 --> 03:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
honor it
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
and i have nothing to fall back on they
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
have 194 colon 3.
 
03:02:41.990 --> 03:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
i have nothing
 
03:02:44.230 --> 03:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
so as a parent i'm stuck in this
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
situation like many other parents who
 
03:02:49.349 --> 03:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
have had no voice we've been silenced
 
03:02:51.429 --> 03:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
the school boards are running rampant
 
03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
and it's not just the school boards it's
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
doctors it's counselors it's all of
 
03:02:58.630 --> 03:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
these people who are making decisions or
 
03:03:01.190 --> 03:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
implementing these coerced
 
03:03:03.670 --> 03:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
mindsets into our children and i know i
 
03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
sound like a conspiracy theorist but
 
03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
what i want my children to know is what
 
03:03:09.830 --> 03:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
i want my children to know
 
03:03:12.870 --> 03:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of kovid we spent so
 
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
much time avoiding the news because i
 
03:03:17.429 --> 03:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
have a child with severe anxiety and by
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
severe anxiety i mean he has panic
 
03:03:21.269 --> 03:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
attacks i don't know if anybody's
 
03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
experienced a panic attack but it is the
 
03:03:26.230 --> 03:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
worst thing that you can experience from
 
03:03:28.309 --> 03:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
a psychological standpoint you feel like
 
03:03:30.230 --> 03:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
you're dying
 
03:03:33.910 --> 03:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
so we made the decision as parents
 
03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
to eliminate all of the additional media
 
03:03:38.950 --> 03:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
because it was causing an adverse
 
03:03:41.110 --> 03:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
reaction for our child
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
he returned to school eventually because
 
03:03:46.550 --> 03:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
again nashua
 
03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
he returned to school and within a week
 
03:03:50.870 --> 03:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
one week
 
03:03:54.070 --> 03:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
he came home hysterically crying visibly
 
03:03:56.469 --> 03:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
upset he got off the bus and fell off
 
03:03:59.429 --> 03:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
the bus as a parent put yourself in that
 
03:03:59.439 --> 03:04:01.110 align:start position:0%
the bus as a parent put yourself in that
shoe

03:04:01.110 --> 03:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
shoe
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
watch your child fall apart
 
03:04:06.150 --> 03:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
because teachers had decided that they
 
03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
were going to tell him that if you're
 
03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
not vaccinated and you don't wear a mask
 
03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
or if others that you love are not
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or not wearing a mask they
 
03:04:18.309 --> 03:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
will die
 
03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
that is what was told to my 12 year old
 
03:04:20.399 --> 03:04:21.190 align:start position:0%
that is what was told to my 12 year old
son

03:04:21.190 --> 03:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
son
 
03:04:22.950 --> 03:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
so not only do i not know what's being
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
curriculum taught but i also don't have
 
03:04:27.910 --> 03:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
a say to question things
 
03:04:30.870 --> 03:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm in support of this bill and i i
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
urge all of you to please
 
03:04:35.910 --> 03:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
give us our parental rights back give us
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
something that is concrete and tangible
 
03:04:39.990 --> 03:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we have as a backing just like
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
these school boards and these doctors
 
03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
and these patient rights and prac like
 
03:04:46.389 --> 03:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
everybody else has rights
 
03:04:48.870 --> 03:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
ours have been muted
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to all please
 
03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
03:04:56.960 --> 03:04:57.910 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
sorry

03:04:57.910 --> 03:04:57.920 align:start position:0%

thank you and thank you for taking my
question

03:05:04.469 --> 03:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
in your experience at with nashua
 
03:05:09.750 --> 03:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
have you
 
03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:11.030 align:start position:0%
have you
been

03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:05:13.110 --> 03:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
stuck in that circle
 
03:05:15.590 --> 03:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
of um just going through administration
 
03:05:17.510 --> 03:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
and not being able to
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
go to the courts to
 
03:05:19.279 --> 03:05:20.950 align:start position:0%
go to the courts to
have

03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
it adjudicated that they need to be
 
03:05:25.030 --> 03:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
giving you this information
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
so that's a really great question
 
03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:28.309 align:start position:0%
so that's a really great question
representative

03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:05:30.550 --> 03:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
i'm a single mom
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
i work full-time i have two children i
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
have one with a disability
 
03:05:34.960 --> 03:05:35.750 align:start position:0%
have one with a disability
so

03:05:35.750 --> 03:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:39.670 --> 03:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
i have spent the last two years
 
03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
going to the teacher going to the
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
administration going to the assistant
 
03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent and then the
 
03:05:48.710 --> 03:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
superintendent and i can't even get in
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
front of the board of education with an
 
03:05:52.150 --> 03:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
appeal because there's no process and
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
they won't make an exception
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
so in order for me to take like legal
 
03:05:57.359 --> 03:05:59.190 align:start position:0%
so in order for me to take like legal
action

03:05:59.190 --> 03:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
action
 
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost money it's going to
 
03:06:05.349 --> 03:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
cost time that i don't necessarily have
 
03:06:07.750 --> 03:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
to fight something that if i had a
 
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
parent's bill of rights i would have the
 
03:06:12.710 --> 03:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to combat it led from a
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
legislative perspective from a legal
 
03:06:16.870 --> 03:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
perspective did that answer your
 
03:06:16.880 --> 03:06:20.389 align:start position:0%
perspective did that answer your
question

03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um the proposed uh
 
03:06:27.110 --> 03:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion in this bill seems to be to
 
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
take them to court
 
03:06:30.070 --> 03:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:06:34.469 --> 03:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if in your example
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would help you if you're if um
 
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
the only recourse is to go to court and
 
03:06:42.950 --> 03:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
you're not in a position to do that so
 
03:06:44.710 --> 03:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that we don't have a
 
03:06:46.630 --> 03:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
parent's bill of rights right now i
 
03:06:49.349 --> 03:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
don't have any recourse so i'm stuck in
 
03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
this vicious circle of going back and
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
forth and back and forth and even if i
 
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
go to court which we've tried we have
 
03:06:59.030 --> 03:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
tried with injunctions
 
03:07:01.830 --> 03:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
they fail we live again in a city that
 
03:07:04.230 --> 03:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
has been left to eat itself
 
03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
we have judges who
 
03:07:06.720 --> 03:07:07.429 align:start position:0%
we have judges who
have

03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:07:07.439 --> 03:07:08.870 align:start position:0%
have
historically

03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
historically
 
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
ruled in favor of the city and we have
 
03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
had zero breaks no breaks i'm not a
 
03:07:17.830 --> 03:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer i can't afford to hire a lawyer
 
03:07:19.670 --> 03:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
but if i had a parent's bill of rights
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
to answer your question representative i
 
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
would have been able to take that legal
 
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
option first
 
03:07:28.710 --> 03:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have been stuck in a hamster
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:40.469 --> 03:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
up next is alison dyer to speak in
 
03:07:44.790 --> 03:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
support of the bill for three to four
 
03:07:44.800 --> 03:07:48.070 align:start position:0%
support of the bill for three to four
minutes

03:07:48.070 --> 03:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:51.190 --> 03:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
hi allison dyer i am also from national
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i am here in support
 
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
03:07:57.670 --> 03:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the sponsors of this
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill for bringing this forward because i
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
think i echo the sentiments of a lot of
 
03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
people here today that
 
03:08:06.870 --> 03:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
we feel like it's needed
 
03:08:09.190 --> 03:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
and i also echo the fact that i'm sad
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:15.910 --> 03:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's a sad thing to have to legislate my
 
03:08:18.230 --> 03:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
parental rights back because they've
 
03:08:20.790 --> 03:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
been so eroded over the last you know
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
two plus years i mean the pandemic
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
itself certainly heightened it but you
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
know for the last decade or so we have
 
03:08:28.309 --> 03:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
felt especially with regards to
 
03:08:28.319 --> 03:08:29.510 align:start position:0%
felt especially with regards to
schooling

03:08:29.510 --> 03:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
schooling
 
03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:30.790 align:start position:0%
schooling
that

03:08:30.790 --> 03:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
what's unfortunate is that we as parents
 
03:08:48.960 --> 03:08:51.429 align:start position:0%
what's unfortunate is that we as parents
um

03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:54.630 --> 03:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
have been kind of viewed as uh
 
03:08:57.670 --> 03:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
cooperative like unpaid functionaries um
 
03:09:03.990 --> 03:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
force were deemed threats to the system
 
03:09:10.469 --> 03:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
and my children are mine and
 
03:09:14.790 --> 03:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'm tired of being told that i am a
 
03:09:16.469 --> 03:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
threat because my basic parental
 
03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
instinct is to direct and protect my
 
03:09:18.479 --> 03:09:19.429 align:start position:0%
instinct is to direct and protect my
child

03:09:19.429 --> 03:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:09:19.439 --> 03:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
child
and

03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
i think what also the two years
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic has really highlighted
 
03:09:26.870 --> 03:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
is that i always thought that the due
 
03:09:29.670 --> 03:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
process clause of
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
our laws protected my my parental right
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and it does not matter how often i
 
03:09:37.590 --> 03:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
bring it up whether it's
 
03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
medical uh school things of that nature
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know i'm i'm told that it
 
03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply and i'm not really sure
 
03:09:48.630 --> 03:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
why it doesn't apply i thought it was
 
03:09:50.790 --> 03:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
there in place to to take care of that
 
03:09:50.800 --> 03:09:51.750 align:start position:0%
there in place to to take care of that
and

03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
now we're in a place where we need this
 
03:09:56.309 --> 03:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
bill of rights in order to
 
03:09:58.630 --> 03:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
restore what i thought was already there
 
03:10:00.550 --> 03:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
i mean uh the woman over there made
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
reference to the birth certificate
 
03:10:04.710 --> 03:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's my child and
 
03:10:04.720 --> 03:10:05.990 align:start position:0%
that's my child and
um

03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time
 
03:10:09.190 --> 03:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
before this hearing when it was
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
originally scheduled and rescheduled i
 
03:10:12.710 --> 03:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
sat for a really long time and tried to
 
03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
write something for this and i found it
 
03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
really hard to do because
 
03:10:21.990 --> 03:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm really sad that we're here that we
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
need to be doing this but
 
03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
we need to do this and and i can't
 
03:10:27.200 --> 03:10:28.150 align:start position:0%
we need to do this and and i can't
implore

03:10:28.150 --> 03:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
implore
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
you any more than
 
03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:31.590 align:start position:0%
you any more than
my

03:10:31.590 --> 03:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:10:34.309 --> 03:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
previous people have have said that it's
 
03:10:37.349 --> 03:10:37.359 align:start position:0%
necessary it's needed and and
 
03:10:40.469 --> 03:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
no government program can ever replace
 
03:10:42.150 --> 03:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
or take
 
03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
or take
what

03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
parents are there to do we we have to
 
03:10:47.349 --> 03:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
support and love and care
 
03:10:47.359 --> 03:10:48.150 align:start position:0%
support and love and care

03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
kids they're the next generation of
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
humans and
 
03:10:55.349 --> 03:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's not political it's not a culture
 
03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
war i don't want to play political
 
03:11:01.030 --> 03:11:01.040 align:start position:0%

i don't
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
want to continue to be schluffed off and
 
03:11:12.309 --> 03:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
and not be able to be allowed to be
 
03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
involved in the way that i feel
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
as the director of the children under my
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%

parent and i respect you for that
 
03:11:58.630 --> 03:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
now you mentioned the last two years
 
03:12:01.030 --> 03:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's been problematic
 
03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
so can you go back four years
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
was it problematic
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
um i i've
 
03:12:09.190 --> 03:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
personally have felt like it's been a
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
problem for at least a decade as we've
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
you know i'm a child of the 80s so
 
03:12:16.309 --> 03:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
things i felt like were a lot different
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
i mean um the
 
03:12:21.429 --> 03:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
my parents were in the school they were
 
03:12:23.110 --> 03:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know in the doctor's appointments
 
03:12:24.870 --> 03:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
with me and things like that and
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
probably about 10 years ago you know
 
03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
when i was in my
 
03:12:30.389 --> 03:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
early 20s um
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
i remember you know
 
03:12:33.910 --> 03:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to bring my mother to a
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment with me or things
 
03:12:37.030 --> 03:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
like that they're like oh well you know
 
03:12:38.790 --> 03:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
do you want to bring her in the room or
 
03:12:40.710 --> 03:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
when i was uh going into my niece or my
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
nephew's school they were like oh you
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
have to wait here and you have to you
 
03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
know go through a six-hour training to
 
03:12:48.550 --> 03:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
be able to come into the classroom to
 
03:12:50.469 --> 03:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
read a book i mean we used to just just
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
be able to sign up for that through the
 
03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:53.510 align:start position:0%
be able to sign up for that through the
school

03:12:53.510 --> 03:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
you know uh you call the office and say
 
03:12:56.790 --> 03:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'd like to come in and read to the to
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
the kindergarten nurse today or do a
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
craft give the teacher a break you know
 
03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:01.990 align:start position:0%
craft give the teacher a break you know
and

03:13:01.990 --> 03:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's all
 
03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
we're just shut out from that and it
 
03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
slowly progressed to where it is now
 
03:13:10.309 --> 03:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
like for example like they said in
 
03:13:11.670 --> 03:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
nashville we're not allowed in the
 
03:13:13.910 --> 03:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
schools we can't volunteer they need
 
03:13:16.469 --> 03:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
people and they won't take us
 
03:13:16.479 --> 03:13:17.269 align:start position:0%
people and they won't take us
so

03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
but i have noticed at least the last
 
03:13:20.870 --> 03:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
decade or so it's changed where it's
 
03:13:22.710 --> 03:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
just not as easy
 
03:13:24.630 --> 03:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
to be involved because
 
03:13:26.229 --> 03:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
we've kind of been pushed in this way
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
that you know other people are the
 
03:13:31.590 --> 03:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
arbiters of our children
 
03:13:33.750 --> 03:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
health and well-being and happiness and
 
03:13:35.349 --> 03:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's just not the case
 
03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm that
 
03:13:39.510 --> 03:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:49.429 --> 03:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:53.190 --> 03:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
up next is representative jeff greeson
 
03:13:55.030 --> 03:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the bill and he's
 
03:14:00.229 --> 03:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:01.670 --> 03:14:01.680 align:start position:0%

16. i'm honored to have worked with
 
03:14:09.990 --> 03:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative terry in writing this
 
03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
very important bill that is long overdue
 
03:14:15.269 --> 03:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
long past 10 years ago go backing over
 
03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
30 years ago
 
03:14:19.030 --> 03:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's occurring with increased frequency
 
03:14:20.790 --> 03:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
all around the country
 
03:14:22.229 --> 03:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
the children are being exposed to
 
03:14:23.590 --> 03:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
materials that their parents find
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
objectionable children are actively
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
encouraged and unable to do things
 
03:14:28.950 --> 03:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
without their parents knowledge let
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
alone permission and children are
 
03:14:32.790 --> 03:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
instructed to conceal things from their
 
03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:33.830 align:start position:0%
instructed to conceal things from their
parents

03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:14:35.590 --> 03:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
the people that are exposing children to
 
03:14:37.349 --> 03:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
the offensive materials and encouraging
 
03:14:39.510 --> 03:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
children to do things surreptitiously
 
03:14:41.349 --> 03:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
and to conceal things from their parents
 
03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
are the ch are the children's teachers
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
school counselors doctors legislators
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
and many others purporting to be
 
03:14:50.790 --> 03:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
advocates of the well-being of children
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
but the supreme court has stated that
 
03:14:55.030 --> 03:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
the interest of parents
 
03:14:57.110 --> 03:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
in the care custody and control of their
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
children is perhaps the oldest and of
 
03:15:01.349 --> 03:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
the recognized fundamental liberty
 
03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
interests protected by the due process
 
03:15:05.590 --> 03:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
clause of the 14th amendment
 
03:15:07.590 --> 03:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
parents have fundamental liberty
 
03:15:09.510 --> 03:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
interest in determining the care and
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their children and these
 
03:15:13.590 --> 03:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
rights are inalienable and may not be
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
intruded upon absent a compelling state
 
03:15:16.319 --> 03:15:17.269 align:start position:0%
intruded upon absent a compelling state
interest

03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
interest
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were asked
 
03:15:20.229 --> 03:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
earlier of representative terry go to
 
03:15:22.469 --> 03:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
this compelling state interest question
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
if there's no compelling state interest
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
the parents rights are supreme in the
 
03:15:28.389 --> 03:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
case of the dispute between parents that
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
may disagree the state can then be
 
03:15:32.309 --> 03:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
brought in to settle that dispute that's
 
03:15:34.630 --> 03:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
what the courts are for but otherwise
 
03:15:36.550 --> 03:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
this court stays out
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
and according to the u.s supreme court
 
03:15:40.469 --> 03:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
the state's interest declines as the
 
03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
life of the child nears ending this
 
03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
means that the state can't interfere
 
03:15:45.910 --> 03:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
with the parents decisions regarding
 
03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
end-of-life decisions for their children
 
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
that goes to that one question about
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
what is life or something that's ending
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
life and it deals it pertains

specifically to end-of-life care for the
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
child and that's why the reasoning of
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
03:16:00.870 --> 03:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
because of the primacy of the
 
03:16:02.469 --> 03:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
relationship between children and their
 
03:16:04.469 --> 03:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
parents it is the responsibility of the
 
03:16:05.910 --> 03:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
state and all of its subordinate
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
entities to recognize promote and

their dependent children
 
03:16:14.070 --> 03:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
except in cases when legal due process
 
03:16:16.229 --> 03:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
supersedes parents are the supreme
 
03:16:17.590 --> 03:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
authority over their children for
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
medical educational moral religious and
 
03:16:22.229 --> 03:16:22.239 align:start position:0%

aspects of the child's life no entity of
 
03:16:26.309 --> 03:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
government or private sector should
 
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
enable promote encourage or permit any
 
03:16:30.870 --> 03:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
behavior that undermines parental
 
03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:32.229 align:start position:0%
behavior that undermines parental
authority

03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
authority
 
03:16:33.750 --> 03:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
anyone who would undermine parental
 
03:16:35.670 --> 03:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
authority destroys the family unit and
 
03:16:37.590 --> 03:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
his anathema to civil society and the
 
03:16:39.030 --> 03:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
rule of law
 
03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
anyone who would expose children to
 
03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
material so offensive that they cannot
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
be read publicly at a school board
 
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
meeting is not educating the children
 
03:16:48.389 --> 03:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
but abusing them
 
03:16:50.150 --> 03:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
anyone who would encourage a child or
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
enable a child or actively participate
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
in any activity along with the child and
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
then encourage that child to conceal
 
03:16:59.190 --> 03:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
that activity from the child's parents
 
03:17:01.349 --> 03:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
is a predator not a protector of
 
03:17:01.359 --> 03:17:02.550 align:start position:0%
is a predator not a protector of
children

03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
anyone who would allow this sort of
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
behavior to occur is actively breaking
 
03:17:08.070 --> 03:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
the bond between child and his or her
 
03:17:10.550 --> 03:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
parents turning the child against his or
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
her parents teaching the child not to
 
03:17:14.550 --> 03:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
trust his or her parents causing the
 
03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
child to believe that his or her parents
 
03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
are the enemy or at best don't have the
 
03:17:21.349 --> 03:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
child's best interest at heart but that
 
03:17:23.190 --> 03:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
the person allowing them to engage in
 
03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
this behavior cares more adolescence is
 
03:17:28.389 --> 03:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
challenging enough as it is without
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
people who claim to love children
 
03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
constantly driving a wedge between the
 
03:17:34.389 --> 03:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
child and his or her parents especially
 
03:17:36.229 --> 03:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
when that is the first relationship the
 
03:17:38.070 --> 03:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
child ever had
 
03:17:40.309 --> 03:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
the rights described in house bill 1431
 
03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
are not rights given by government to
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
parents but rather confirms and affirms
 
03:17:48.070 --> 03:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
these natural inalienable rights that
 
03:17:50.550 --> 03:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
parents already possess so why is house
 
03:17:52.870 --> 03:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
bill 1431 necessary when these are such
 
03:17:54.790 --> 03:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights because these rights
 
03:17:56.710 --> 03:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
are being violated on a regular basis
 
03:17:58.469 --> 03:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
and with impunity
 
03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
let me give you just a few examples one
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned earlier
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
states are allowed multiple states are
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
now allowing sex change operations
 
03:18:10.229 --> 03:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
without parental permission or consent
 
03:18:12.389 --> 03:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
and that's key without parental
 
03:18:15.429 --> 03:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
permission or consent abortions without
 
03:18:18.550 --> 03:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
a parental permission or consent
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%

03:18:23.349 --> 03:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
or consent
 
03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
an elementary school in denver colorado
 
03:18:27.190 --> 03:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
posts on their web page the principles
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
that will guide their instruction during
 
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
school week in action this year and
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
these principles are from blm guiding
 
03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
principles and one of these is labeled
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
black villages
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
and it's defined as the disruption
 
03:18:45.349 --> 03:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
of western nuclear family dynamics and a
 
03:18:48.630 --> 03:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
return to the collective village that
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
takes care of each other
 
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
all across the country students of all
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
ages are given surveys as part of the
 
03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning model of
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
education these surveys are not for
 
03:19:01.269 --> 03:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
academic achievement or instruction but
 
03:19:02.710 --> 03:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
rather ask children about their
 
03:19:04.950 --> 03:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
attitudes gender identities sex
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
practices and home lives
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
a substitute teacher was recently fired
 
03:19:12.070 --> 03:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
for not recognizing a child's identity
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
as a cat and a school in michigan puts
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
litter boxes in the unisex bathrooms for
 
03:19:21.750 --> 03:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
those children that identify as a cat
 
03:19:24.229 --> 03:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
i am breaking the law
 
03:19:26.710 --> 03:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
when i tell my grandson he's not really
 
03:19:29.030 --> 03:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
a dinosaur because according to new
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire law if you counsel a boy that
 
03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
he is not a girl or a girl that she is
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
not a boy
 
03:19:36.790 --> 03:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
you are breaking the law because that's
 
03:19:38.950 --> 03:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
considered conversion therapy we're
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
gonna have to expand that now to
 
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
dinosaurs and evidently cats
 
03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:47.349 align:start position:0%
dinosaurs and evidently cats
as

03:19:47.349 --> 03:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire there are two
 
03:19:50.550 --> 03:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
bills presently before the house of
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
representatives that explicitly
 
03:19:56.550 --> 03:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
are calling for children to be able to
 
03:19:56.560 --> 03:19:57.429 align:start position:0%
are calling for children to be able to
act

03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
act
 
03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
without parental permission or consent
 
03:20:04.469 --> 03:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
house bills 1409 and 1126 i don't care
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
what the bills are whether whether good
 
03:20:08.309 --> 03:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
ideas are bad but they're designed to be
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
done without parental consent
 
03:20:13.190 --> 03:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
or permission
 
03:20:16.229 --> 03:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
or excuse me knowledge
 
03:20:18.710 --> 03:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is necessary to clarify that
 
03:20:20.070 --> 03:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
parents have authority over their
 
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
children at all times a teacher acting
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
in loco parentis does not supersede the
 
03:20:26.790 --> 03:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
authority of parents and a doctor does
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
not have authority over a child patient
 
03:20:30.389 --> 03:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
that supersedes the parents of that
 
03:20:32.550 --> 03:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
child it doesn't take a village to raise
 
03:20:34.229 --> 03:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
the children the village needs to
 
03:20:36.070 --> 03:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
respect the parents and work at the
 
03:20:37.510 --> 03:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
direction of the parents because
 
03:20:40.229 --> 03:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
teachers are employees hired by parents
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
to educate the children not turn them
 
03:20:43.830 --> 03:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
against the parents
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
doctors are hired by parents to provide
 
03:20:48.630 --> 03:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
health care opinions
 
03:20:50.469 --> 03:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
and recommendations
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
and then to provide the subsequent
 
03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
medical treatments as directed by the
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
parents if a parent wants a second
 
03:20:59.349 --> 03:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
opinion or rejects a particular
 
03:21:01.830 --> 03:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation that is not child abuse
 
03:21:04.710 --> 03:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
and the doctor has no authority to act
 
03:21:06.389 --> 03:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
now we complain that social media
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
platforms don't do enough to protect
 
03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
children from harmful content available
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
on those platforms and yet planned
 
03:21:14.550 --> 03:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
parenthood sex education curriculum that
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
is pervasive across this country is so
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
sexually explicit that i would be gavel
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
down if i began reading the materials
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
here to you today
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
we demand that social media make sure
 
03:21:25.830 --> 03:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
children aren't subscribing without
 
03:21:27.990 --> 03:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
parental permission but we can allow a
 
03:21:30.309 --> 03:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
teacher at school to take any age girl
 
03:21:32.229 --> 03:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
down to the abortion clinic to obtain an
 
03:21:35.030 --> 03:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
abortion without parental permission
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
children are suspended from school for
 
03:21:38.229 --> 03:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
taking an aspirin without obtaining it
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
from the school nurse but we can allow
 
03:21:41.750 --> 03:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
that same school nurse to take that same
 
03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
child to a clinic to obtain and start
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
taking puberty blocking hormones without
 
03:21:48.870 --> 03:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
informing the parents
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1431 is of utmost importance
 
03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
because the rights of parents are being
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
trampled to the detriment of children
 
03:21:56.469 --> 03:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
including parents now being treated as
 
03:21:58.870 --> 03:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
domestic terrorists for objecting to
 
03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
anything being done in government
 
03:22:02.469 --> 03:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
schools including their daughters being
 
03:22:04.229 --> 03:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
raped in school bathrooms while the

thank you and thank you for taking the
question

03:22:27.030 --> 03:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
drug treatment programs which people
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
over the age of 13
 
03:22:37.840 --> 03:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
over the age of 13
can

03:22:38.630 --> 03:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
can

access without parental
 
03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:43.670 align:start position:0%
access without parental
consent

03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:46.150 --> 03:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:46.950 align:start position:0%
would you be
um

03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
one and
 
03:22:50.710 --> 03:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that they do that
 
03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
so that those
 
03:22:55.110 --> 03:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
treatments can be offered in such a case
 
03:22:55.990 --> 03:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:22:58.469 --> 03:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
the kid not would not take advantage of
 
03:22:58.479 --> 03:22:59.269 align:start position:0%
the kid not would not take advantage of
them

03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:23:00.870 --> 03:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
if they needed to tell their parents
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
in your testimony would you
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me to be believe that you
 
03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:11.429 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me to be believe that you
would

03:23:11.429 --> 03:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:23:15.190 --> 03:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
not like that program to exist because
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
um without parental consent and those
 
03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
peop those children that were addicted
 
03:23:22.150 --> 03:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
to some substances and wanted some
 
03:23:24.870 --> 03:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
treatment um
 
03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
would not
 
03:23:27.910 --> 03:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
accept that treatment if it was a
 
03:23:30.229 --> 03:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
condition of telling their parents is
 
03:23:30.239 --> 03:23:31.110 align:start position:0%
condition of telling their parents is
that

03:23:31.110 --> 03:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
am i getting the
 
03:23:34.550 --> 03:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
your position correctly i think we need
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
to get down to why does the child feel
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
like they don't they they can't get
 
03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
their parents permission or talk to
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
their parents about their addiction
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
they have been they have been
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
conditioned for years now not to trust
 
03:23:48.309 --> 03:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
their parents that if they if they want
 
03:23:50.309 --> 03:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
to do anything whatever it is if their
 
03:23:51.990 --> 03:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
parents say no we're gonna let you go
 
03:23:53.990 --> 03:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
ahead and do it anyway
 
03:23:57.670 --> 03:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
so we we've built this wedge of distrust
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
don't trust your parents your parents
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
are the enemy whatever the case may be
 
03:24:03.510 --> 03:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:24:06.150 --> 03:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
does it if a child needs treatment
 
03:24:07.910 --> 03:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
i can't think of a parent one who loves
 
03:24:09.750 --> 03:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
their child that would deny the child
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of treatment
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's a question of
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
where did this attitude of doing things
 
03:24:17.830 --> 03:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
behind parents back we're not talking
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
about sneaking into a rated r movie
 
03:24:21.670 --> 03:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about life-altering
 
03:24:24.150 --> 03:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
decisions there's a reason why we don't
 
03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
have people under the age of 18 voting
 
03:24:29.429 --> 03:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
god i hope we never change that
 
03:24:30.870 --> 03:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why you have to be a
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
certain age to get a driver's license
 
03:24:33.990 --> 03:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why i had to sign my
 
03:24:35.750 --> 03:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
son's enlistment form so he could join
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
the united states marine corps before
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
the age of of 18. there's a reason why
 
03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
we have these we're going to allow
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
children to make decisions and we're
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
specifically targeting all these things
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
you can do this behind your parents
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:00.389 --> 03:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
so is that a no that the the program
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
should not exist
 
03:25:04.550 --> 03:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
the the program itself can exist there's
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with having a program like
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
that why are we purposely pushing it
 
03:25:10.389 --> 03:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
that you can do this behind your parents
 
03:25:10.399 --> 03:25:16.150 align:start position:0%
that you can do this behind your parents
backs

03:25:16.150 --> 03:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:18.550 --> 03:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
03:25:19.830 --> 03:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative at the beginning of your
 
03:25:22.080 --> 03:25:23.429 align:start position:0%
representative at the beginning of your
testimony

03:25:23.429 --> 03:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
you put a perception in my head i need
 
03:25:28.150 --> 03:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
to clarify if this were to become law
 
03:25:28.160 --> 03:25:29.349 align:start position:0%
to clarify if this were to become law
then

03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
infringement on parental rights would be
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
can you at the beginning of at the
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
beginning of your
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
testimony you referenced legislators
 
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
included in
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
prohibition legislators pushing
 
03:25:49.990 --> 03:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislation like the two house bills
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
that i named specifically saying hey you
 
03:25:53.190 --> 03:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
can do this without your parents
 
03:25:53.200 --> 03:25:55.429 align:start position:0%
can do this without your parents
permission

03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
permission
 
03:25:57.429 --> 03:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
so back to my original question if this
 
03:25:59.830 --> 03:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
were to become statute
 
03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:00.950 align:start position:0%
were to become statute
would

03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:26:03.510 --> 03:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
legislators be prohibited
 
03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:06.229 align:start position:0%
legislators be prohibited
from

03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
i seem to recall there being phrases in
 
03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
the u.s constitution congress shall make
 
03:26:21.190 --> 03:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
no law
 
03:26:23.190 --> 03:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera et cetera infringing
 
03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
on free speech freedom of assembly
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
right to keep and bear arms things like
 
03:26:30.870 --> 03:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
that so no the legislature cannot pass
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
laws that would infringe on parental
 
03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
rights these these are inalienable
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
rights the us constitution is going to
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
be the
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court has affirmed these
 
03:26:43.269 --> 03:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
inalienable rights of parents
 
03:26:47.190 --> 03:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
so no we can't pass laws that violate
 
03:26:49.750 --> 03:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
natural rights
 
03:26:52.870 --> 03:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:03.030 --> 03:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:05.670 --> 03:27:05.680 align:start position:0%

03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
if i could just step back off my remarks
 
03:27:53.590 --> 03:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
i felt sad
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony
 
03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
of all the folks that have come before
 
03:28:01.349 --> 03:28:01.359 align:start position:0%

the intent that they have to protect
 
03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make this a better bill it
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
does make it an issue that is a really
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%

parents rights though are already well

this bill upends long stand the
 
03:28:35.190 --> 03:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
long-standing new hampshire principle
 
03:28:37.269 --> 03:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
of local controls
 
03:28:39.269 --> 03:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
of schools
 
03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
rather than legislative control of local
 
03:28:42.640 --> 03:28:45.510 align:start position:0%
rather than legislative control of local
schools

03:28:45.510 --> 03:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:48.870 --> 03:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
this seeks to create a one-size-fits-all
 
03:28:51.670 --> 03:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
state level intervention
 
03:28:53.349 --> 03:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
that ought to be addressed through
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
school board elections which happen
 
03:28:59.510 --> 03:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:04.309 --> 03:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
finally the nasw opposes hp 1431
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
for one essential reason beyond that
 
03:29:08.800 --> 03:29:10.229 align:start position:0%
for one essential reason beyond that
children

03:29:10.229 --> 03:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot today about states
 
03:29:14.070 --> 03:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
rights about parents rights about state
 
03:29:16.070 --> 03:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
what the state should do
 
03:29:18.830 --> 03:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
we have not heard about children's
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
rights and this committee has struggled
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
with the issue of children's rights over
 
03:29:29.030 --> 03:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:31.110 --> 03:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
children as new hampshire and u.s
 
03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:32.469 align:start position:0%
children as new hampshire and u.s
citizens

03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
enjoy their own constitutional rights
 
03:29:40.950 --> 03:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct from their parents
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
but those rights have been diminished
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:51.990 --> 03:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:55.030 --> 03:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
proposes to further diminish
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
those rights
 
03:30:00.150 --> 03:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
so that parents can have
 
03:30:08.309 --> 03:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that many social workers are
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
mental health counselors and therapists
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
working in a number of areas working
 
03:30:17.590 --> 03:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
with kids working with adults
 
03:30:20.550 --> 03:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
many of us here are also parents
 
03:30:22.469 --> 03:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
i happen to be a grandfather for the
 
03:30:25.190 --> 03:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:26.790 --> 03:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
we all know
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
03:30:30.150 --> 03:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
optimal it is best practice that
 
03:30:31.590 --> 03:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
children should always talk to their
 
03:30:31.600 --> 03:30:33.670 align:start position:0%
children should always talk to their
parents

03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:30:36.630 --> 03:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
but we also know that every family
 
03:30:38.469 --> 03:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
structure does not function in the same
 
03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
way and every child is not comfortable
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
at all times talking to their parents
 
03:30:48.070 --> 03:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
legislating that kids have to talk to
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
their parents
 
03:30:52.870 --> 03:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
will not be any more successful
 
03:30:54.309 --> 03:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
than today
 
03:30:57.750 --> 03:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
only by talking to our children
 
03:30:57.760 --> 03:30:58.710 align:start position:0%
only by talking to our children
and

03:30:58.710 --> 03:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:01.269 --> 03:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
talking to the school administrators the
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
teachers the school boards
 
03:31:05.429 --> 03:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
can we truly come to an understanding of
 
03:31:05.439 --> 03:31:06.550 align:start position:0%
can we truly come to an understanding of
this

03:31:06.550 --> 03:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
legislating will just get put another
 
03:31:11.349 --> 03:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
law in the books that won't
 
03:31:13.830 --> 03:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
provide any more effect
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
than the current laws on the books do
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
for that reason the nesw employs this
 
03:31:18.720 --> 03:31:19.830 align:start position:0%
for that reason the nesw employs this
committee

03:31:19.830 --> 03:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:31:22.710 --> 03:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
to itl this bill
 
03:31:24.550 --> 03:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
in the future we are more than happy to
 
03:31:27.670 --> 03:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
work with any groups who want to try to
 
03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
address this through other means we'd be
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
happy to be involved in that
 
03:31:33.990 --> 03:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll conclude my remarks
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
03:31:39.670 --> 03:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative belanger

thank you madam chair thank you mr dejoy
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
for being here today and testifying on
 
03:31:45.750 --> 03:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of this bill
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
what i failed to
 
03:31:49.110 --> 03:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
mention earlier when i was asking my
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions was the case law and you had
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
just insinuated that there is case law
 
03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:31:56.080 --> 03:31:57.429 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
that

03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:59.750 --> 03:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
give parents rights can you
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
reference that case lies off the top of
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
my head i don't know what it is
 
03:32:04.950 --> 03:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:32:07.110 --> 03:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative and i i wish i'm always
 
03:32:08.710 --> 03:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
proud of my memory so i wish i could
 
03:32:10.150 --> 03:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
cite the case law
 
03:32:12.389 --> 03:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
i will i'm aware that
 
03:32:14.950 --> 03:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
chief justice brock wrote the opinion
 
03:32:17.590 --> 03:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not off standing here i can't give
 
03:32:19.030 --> 03:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
you the case though i can probably pull
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
it up fairly easily
 
03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
but the essence of the law
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
recognized the parents constitutional
 
03:32:25.760 --> 03:32:27.030 align:start position:0%
recognized the parents constitutional
rights

03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
rights
 
03:32:28.950 --> 03:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
and did not recognize
 
03:32:35.190 --> 03:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:37.349 --> 03:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chai follow up thank you
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question mr
 
03:32:38.720 --> 03:32:39.670 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question mr
dejoy

03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
dejoy
 
03:32:43.269 --> 03:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
um in regards to this bill
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
do you think that that case law
 
03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
in in your professional opinion is
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:56.710 --> 03:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
let me let me begin by saying that i am
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer nor do i pretend to be a
 
03:32:58.640 --> 03:32:59.510 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer nor do i pretend to be a
lawyer

03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
03:33:01.590 --> 03:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
i i can only the way i can answer that
 
03:33:01.600 --> 03:33:03.269 align:start position:0%
i i can only the way i can answer that
representative

03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:33:06.070 --> 03:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
is to talk about an issue that i was
 
03:33:08.229 --> 03:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
involved with this committee in
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
four five six years ago
 
03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
when we were trying to change the child
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
protection statutes
 
03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
to further protect children because
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
there was a disclaimer in the statutes
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
and every time we we made a move
 
03:33:25.670 --> 03:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
the lawyers at the table
 
03:33:28.469 --> 03:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
would say something effective you can't
 
03:33:30.870 --> 03:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
do that it violate would violate the
 
03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
case law
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so we were left with
 
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
not many options to try to protect
 
03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
i think that between the case law the
 
03:33:47.670 --> 03:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
constitution and the statutes as they
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
stand today
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
these laws are well enumerated to
 
03:33:52.080 --> 03:33:53.590 align:start position:0%
these laws are well enumerated to
provide

03:33:53.590 --> 03:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:33:53.600 --> 03:33:54.710 align:start position:0%
provide
parents

03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
no further questions madam chair thank
 
03:34:00.239 --> 03:34:02.150 align:start position:0%

03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
question in the example that we heard

question in the example that we heard
previously

03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
previously
 
03:34:12.309 --> 03:34:12.319 align:start position:0%

03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
would you suggest that
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
that in the case of dealing with schools

um that there
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
um could be an improvement or you think
 
03:34:36.950 --> 03:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
that that also is um
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
i'll not comment on any of the specific
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
anecdotes because i don't have both
 
03:34:52.389 --> 03:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
sides of the story
 
03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
it may be entirely as it was presented
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
it may not be or maybe somewhere in the
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
middle so commenting on that is would be
 
03:35:01.990 --> 03:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate but i will say that in any
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
human interactions
 
03:35:06.150 --> 03:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
things can always be better
 
03:35:07.590 --> 03:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know how many husbands and wives
 
03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
have misunderstood each other
 
03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know we can always communicate
 
03:35:11.680 --> 03:35:14.309 align:start position:0%
you know we can always communicate
better

03:35:14.309 --> 03:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:14.319 --> 03:35:15.429 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:35:15.429 --> 03:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:35:18.229 --> 03:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's happened in nashua
 
03:35:20.309 --> 03:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
or any other school district except mine
 
03:35:22.830 --> 03:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
here in concord
 
03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:24.389 align:start position:0%
here in concord
but

03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:35:28.469 --> 03:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
it's it strains my belief
 
03:35:28.479 --> 03:35:30.950 align:start position:0%
it's it strains my belief
that

03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:33.190 --> 03:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
that no that a school board would refuse
 
03:35:34.870 --> 03:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
to talk
 
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
constructively about
 
03:35:38.710 --> 03:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
issues that's why i reference the
 
03:35:38.720 --> 03:35:39.750 align:start position:0%
issues that's why i reference the
elections

03:35:39.750 --> 03:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
elections
 
03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know you all represent your
 
03:35:42.950 --> 03:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
constituents i'm sure you all have done
 
03:35:45.429 --> 03:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
things that anger your constituents
 
03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
they have the ability every two years to
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
reelect you and not reelect you
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
and that's the same with the school
 
03:35:50.319 --> 03:35:56.469 align:start position:0%
and that's the same with the school
board

03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:56.479 --> 03:35:58.229 align:start position:0%

parent enemy
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
now there are some people who made
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
comments in here earlier that they found
 
04:49:53.110 --> 04:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
it difficult to believe some of these
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
things that are being testified too i'm
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
here to provide you with some case
 
04:49:58.708 --> 04:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
studies some documents
 
04:49:58.718 --> 04:49:59.750 align:start position:0%
studies some documents
okay

04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:01.110 --> 04:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm here to tell you first that there's
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
no amount of lipstick that will prettify
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
this pig
 
04:50:07.510 --> 04:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
all right this is the term horrified was
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
used and it is horrifying i don't
 
04:50:12.070 --> 04:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
horrify easily but i'm telling you that
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
is that we send our kids off to school
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
and we expect them to learn mathematics
 
04:50:26.400 --> 04:50:28.150 align:start position:0%
and we expect them to learn mathematics

04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%

history
 
04:50:33.430 --> 04:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
spelling reading and writing and instead
 
04:50:34.868 --> 04:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
they're subjected to political
 
04:50:34.878 --> 04:50:37.430 align:start position:0%
they're subjected to political
indoctrination

04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
indoctrination
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple of topics in
 
04:50:39.280 --> 04:50:40.470 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple of topics in
particular

04:50:40.470 --> 04:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:50:42.310 --> 04:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not choosing these because i like
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
them best i'm telling you because in my
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
research they're the ones that show up
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
the most
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
kids are taught things
 
04:50:49.520 --> 04:50:50.788 align:start position:0%
kids are taught things
like

04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
all white children from the moment of
 
04:50:52.878 --> 04:50:53.910 align:start position:0%
all white children from the moment of
birth

04:50:53.910 --> 04:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
birth
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
are racists
 
04:50:58.150 --> 04:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
every white person is a racist and
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
always will be and only white people can
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
be racist
 
04:51:02.480 --> 04:51:04.550 align:start position:0%
be racist
okay

04:51:04.550 --> 04:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:51:06.310 --> 04:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
they're taught things and i can tell you
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
from my own research experience
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh somebody who has studied the cell
 
04:51:13.110 --> 04:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
molecular biology of development and
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
reproductive biology
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
they're also taught
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
the false narrative that
 
04:51:21.190 --> 04:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
with the drug regime and some plastic
 
04:51:21.200 --> 04:51:22.390 align:start position:0%
with the drug regime and some plastic
surgery

04:51:22.390 --> 04:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
04:51:24.310 --> 04:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
a boy can be turned into a girl and a
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
girl can be turned into a boy
 
04:51:29.750 --> 04:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
well there are a lot of parents
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
who find these falsehoods not only
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
objectionable but repugnant
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
let's not forget
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
these kids
 
04:51:38.320 --> 04:51:39.750 align:start position:0%
these kids
are

04:51:39.750 --> 04:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:51:39.760 --> 04:51:41.510 align:start position:0%
are
yours

04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
yours
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
despite what anybody might say
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
these kids
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
belong to the parents
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
they are legally
 
04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
morally emotionally
 
04:51:53.190 --> 04:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
in charge
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
and responsible
 
04:51:57.590 --> 04:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
despite what anyone might think between
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
the hours of nine o'clock and three
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
school officials across the country
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
don't like the pushback that they're
 
04:52:09.590 --> 04:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
getting on this
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
so they've resorted to
 
04:52:11.920 --> 04:52:15.430 align:start position:0%
so they've resorted to
concealment

04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:15.440 --> 04:52:16.788 align:start position:0%
 
deception

04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
deception
 
04:52:19.190 --> 04:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
and even deceit
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
i'm going to lay out a few examples of
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
these things
 
04:52:24.390 --> 04:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
right these deal with resignations
 
04:52:26.470 --> 04:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
convictions indictments
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
lawsuits this isn't just stuff i'm
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
reading on high wire press
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:52:33.750 --> 04:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
and lest
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
lest we make any fake excuse that this
 
04:52:38.470 --> 04:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
is this stuff that's happening in the
 
04:52:40.948 --> 04:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
other 49 states
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
is it happening in new hampshire no
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
not new hampshire
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
well i'm here to tell you yes and i'm
 
04:52:49.510 --> 04:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to finish up my testimony with
 
04:52:50.788 --> 04:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
just a couple of examples in new
 
04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%

04:52:57.760 --> 04:52:58.708 align:start position:0%
too and one of the first questions is
always

04:52:58.708 --> 04:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
always
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
well is this really a problem in new
 
04:53:00.320 --> 04:53:01.590 align:start position:0%
well is this really a problem in new
hampshire

yes
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
most decidedly it is a problem in new
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it's within our power to
 
04:53:08.948 --> 04:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
do something about it
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
so let me just give you a few examples
 
04:53:12.788 --> 04:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
from across the nation
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%

instructed teachers and principals
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
you get a load of this in case you have
 
04:53:25.590 --> 04:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
any doubt about this from anything that
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
was said before instructed
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
school teachers and principals
 
04:53:33.670 --> 04:53:33.680 align:start position:0%

04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
that you give to the parents
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
and one that's the one we're really
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
going to teach

could you imagine
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
if you substitute almost any other word
 
04:55:56.470 --> 04:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
in there for whiteness
 
04:55:58.470 --> 04:55:58.480 align:start position:0%

course
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%

critical race theory here well of course
 
04:56:09.910 --> 04:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
the parent found out that that wasn't
 
04:56:11.430 --> 04:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
the case that they are
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
that parent was then harassed
 
04:56:16.628 --> 04:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
spoken over shut out of meetings and
 
04:56:18.390 --> 04:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
later found out
 
04:56:20.788 --> 04:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
that contrary to statute the school
 
04:56:23.190 --> 04:56:23.200 align:start position:0%

okay
 
04:57:00.868 --> 04:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
they lied
 
04:57:02.550 --> 04:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
they said that
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
they denied first that there were any
 
04:57:06.550 --> 04:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
private meetings
 
04:57:07.830 --> 04:57:07.840 align:start position:0%

insisted
 
04:57:09.120 --> 04:57:10.070 align:start position:0%
insisted
that

04:57:10.070 --> 04:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
the minutes of the meeting after they
 
04:57:13.350 --> 04:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
had to admit that there were meetings
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
were sealed they were not sealed until
 
04:57:16.320 --> 04:57:17.350 align:start position:0%
were sealed they were not sealed until
finally

04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
finally

one of uh her colleagues
 
04:57:21.510 --> 04:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term i'll use the
 
04:57:23.910 --> 04:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
vernacular ratted her out
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
and now she's facing perjury charges

let me tell you about thornton new
 
04:57:28.798 --> 04:57:32.150 align:start position:0%
let me tell you about thornton new
hampshire

04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
thornton's a town just north of me
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
people attended a school board meeting
 
04:57:38.550 --> 04:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
they asked
 
04:57:41.110 --> 04:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
the school board members could you place
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum material materials in the
 
04:57:43.280 --> 04:57:44.390 align:start position:0%
curriculum material materials in the
library

04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
library
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
they were told no one school board
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
member actually questioned publicly why
 
04:57:51.750 --> 04:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
should we have to have input from
 
04:57:51.760 --> 04:57:54.310 align:start position:0%
should we have to have input from
parents

04:57:54.310 --> 04:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
well maybe because some of us are
 
04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
educated and have expertise that even
 
04:58:00.628 --> 04:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
you lofty individuals don't have that's
 
04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
number one but i have a couple of better
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
reasons how about because like i was
 
04:58:08.310 --> 04:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
when i was teaching i'm a servant of the
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
public how about because you're a
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
servant of the public and we taxpayers
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
we pay your salary and we pay for the
 
04:58:17.350 --> 04:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum development and we pay for
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
the curriculum materials and we pay for
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
these brick walls
 
04:58:23.350 --> 04:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
that you work within each and every day
 
04:58:28.708 --> 04:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
here's the ironic aspect of my theory of
 
04:58:34.550 --> 04:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
my testimony and um then i'm just going
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
to make a closing statement and
 
04:58:37.120 --> 04:58:37.910 align:start position:0%
to make a closing statement and
be

04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
particularly delighted to answer any
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
questions you see answering questions is
 
04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
what i did for 40 years at the lab bench
 
04:58:45.750 --> 04:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the classroom
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i'll be very happy to answer even
 
04:58:48.628 --> 04:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were
 
04:58:53.510 --> 04:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
these cases that i mentioned to you from
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
around the country and here in new
 
04:58:57.360 --> 04:58:59.990 align:start position:0%
around the country and here in new
hampshire

04:58:59.990 --> 04:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.788 --> 04:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
they're just a few examples of many
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:59:06.948 --> 04:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
but the irony is is that
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
a couple of months ago
 
04:59:11.190 --> 04:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
i contacted
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
our school principal
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i explained
 
04:59:16.788 --> 04:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
in an email
 
04:59:18.550 --> 04:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know this is a problem parents have
 
04:59:21.510 --> 04:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
lost confidence in the school system
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
i understand that some of this this
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
stuff isn't going on in the campton
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
schools but
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
it would be really a good idea i think
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
for a few of us to get together
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
and get ahead of this before it becomes
 
04:59:34.868 --> 04:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
a problem in our school district we
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't want parents being labeled
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
terrorists we don't want lawsuits and
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
resignations let's get together and see
 
04:59:42.550 --> 04:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
what we can do to head off a potential
 
04:59:42.560 --> 04:59:44.708 align:start position:0%
what we can do to head off a potential
problem

04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
that was in december
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
and i've heard nothing
 
04:59:50.240 --> 04:59:51.030 align:start position:0%
and i've heard nothing
so

04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
apparently this lofty individual has
 
04:59:53.120 --> 04:59:54.310 align:start position:0%
apparently this lofty individual has
deigned

04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
deigned
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
to not even
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
reply to my communication
 
05:00:02.550 --> 05:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
we have a problem here houston
 
05:00:04.948 --> 05:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
all right when a state rep contacts you
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
politely i know i could be sharp edged
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes but i sent him a polite email
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
offering to get together and see what we
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
could do to help everybody involved
 
05:00:17.590 --> 05:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
and doesn't even receive a reply like
 
05:00:18.868 --> 05:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:00:20.550 --> 05:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
mr allegro but
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm too busy right now can we
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
set this for some time in the future
 
05:00:30.150 --> 05:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
in spite of the disturbed insistence
 
05:00:34.230 --> 05:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
that when we drop our kids off on the
 
05:00:36.070 --> 05:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
sidewalk at the school that they're no
 
05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
longer our kids for those eight or so
 
05:00:38.240 --> 05:00:39.190 align:start position:0%
longer our kids for those eight or so
hours

05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:00:41.830 --> 05:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
in spite of the disturbed insistence
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
that parents use schools
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
as babysitters that's not the case kids
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
belong to
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
their parents
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
i don't care if there are people who
 
05:00:55.750 --> 05:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe that or not it's a fact
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's a natural fact and it's a natural
 
05:00:57.600 --> 05:00:59.030 align:start position:0%
it's a natural fact and it's a natural
right

05:00:59.030 --> 05:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:01:00.628 --> 05:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
the same parents who pay for the school
 
05:01:02.708 --> 05:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
buildings the salaries the curricula the
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
development and the materials of those
 
05:01:04.080 --> 05:01:05.670 align:start position:0%
development and the materials of those
curricula

05:01:05.670 --> 05:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
curricula
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
they rightfully demand
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
and more importantly they deserve
 
05:01:10.878 --> 05:01:13.190 align:start position:0%
and more importantly they deserve
transparency

05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's what hb

no whenever possible thank you for your
attention

05:01:37.270 --> 05:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative pertegnet
 
05:01:45.430 --> 05:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
my mouth isn't working thank you madam
 
05:01:46.708 --> 05:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
05:01:48.070 --> 05:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
you uh made reference to curriculum uh a
 
05:01:52.150 --> 05:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
number of times and i think in one
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
instance you had talked about two sets
 
05:01:56.550 --> 05:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
in a particular school district may i
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
ask i have a bad ear and i'm going to
 
05:02:00.550 --> 05:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
ask you to
 
05:02:02.230 --> 05:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
how's that is that a little better
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay so
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
you had referenced curriculum a number
 
05:02:09.670 --> 05:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
of times and i think in one example you
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
said the school district had two
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
different sets depending upon the
 
05:02:13.120 --> 05:02:14.788 align:start position:0%
different sets depending upon the
circumstance

05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
05:02:16.230 --> 05:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding of curriculum
 
05:02:18.708 --> 05:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
development and i too am a teacher of 40
 
05:02:21.190 --> 05:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
years and i've chaired curriculum
 
05:02:21.200 --> 05:02:22.628 align:start position:0%
years and i've chaired curriculum
committees

05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
committees
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's a process that takes a few years
 
05:02:25.440 --> 05:02:26.708 align:start position:0%
it's a process that takes a few years
and

05:02:26.708 --> 05:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
it involves parents and stakeholders in
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
the community
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
and when the document is created after a
 
05:02:34.708 --> 05:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
05:02:36.628 --> 05:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
it has to be approved by the school
 
05:02:36.638 --> 05:02:37.590 align:start position:0%
it has to be approved by the school
board

05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
and as a result being approved by the
 
05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
school board with so many stakeholders
 
05:02:44.788 --> 05:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you say that it reflects
 
05:02:47.590 --> 05:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
local community standards so maybe the
 
05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
use of the word curriculum is different
 
05:02:51.190 --> 05:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
from instructional practices i just want
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
some clarification on that
 
05:02:55.350 --> 05:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
sure so i i want to make sure i heard
 
05:02:57.030 --> 05:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
the beginning of of what you're asking
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
me uh did you mention that i said that
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's two curricula is did i
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
hear that right if if i understood you
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
correctly i believe you
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
gave an example where you said there
 
05:03:09.030 --> 05:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
were two different sets of curriculums
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
depending upon the circumstance one for
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
one group one for another and i said
 
05:03:14.470 --> 05:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's that can't be because a
 
05:03:16.708 --> 05:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
curriculum is a document that has
 
05:03:19.110 --> 05:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
developed over a number of years and you
 
05:03:20.948 --> 05:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
can view it on the school district's
 
05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
website and it's approved by the school
 
05:03:25.270 --> 05:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
board so maybe the use of the word
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
curriculum is different from maybe
 
05:03:28.948 --> 05:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
instructional practice or no i'm using
 
05:03:30.550 --> 05:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
the word curriculum as it's intended to
 
05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
be used this isn't a case where there
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
was an evolving curriculum or two
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
separate curricula for the same use
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
i think i was clear in stating that
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
the principals and the teachers were
 
05:03:42.718 --> 05:03:44.310 align:start position:0%
the principals and the teachers were
instructed

05:03:44.310 --> 05:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
instructed
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
to present one curriculum to parents
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
but teach another okay
 
05:03:53.110 --> 05:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's unacceptable now um let me see
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of your question if i can
 
05:03:57.750 --> 05:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
answer it uh if i can recall it you were
 
05:04:00.150 --> 05:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
asking about it being an evolving thing
 
05:04:02.550 --> 05:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
would repeat it please i'm sorry
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
no my question specifically was on the
 
05:04:05.830 --> 05:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
two different sets of curriculum and i
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
think you've answered that question um
 
05:04:10.390 --> 05:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
if i made madame yeah i remember
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
that follow-up um the curriculum is a
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
matter of public document
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
and so very often it can be found on the
 
05:04:20.230 --> 05:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
school's website right so if there is an
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
official curriculum that parents can see
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
yes how then is it possible for the
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
school district to turn around and tell
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
the parents something totally different
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you which is very evident when
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
they just look online thank you for that
 
05:04:37.030 --> 05:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
question you made my point precisely you
 
05:04:37.040 --> 05:04:38.070 align:start position:0%
question you made my point precisely you
see

05:04:38.070 --> 05:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's the way it should be and if
 
05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's the way it was we wouldn't have
 
05:04:43.750 --> 05:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
any problem i myself have attempted to
 
05:04:46.550 --> 05:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
retrieve curricula from schools and so
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
has my wife and acquaintances in fact
 
05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
most recently
 
05:04:53.990 --> 05:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
in campton a school board member has
 
05:04:57.590 --> 05:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
requested the curriculum and was denied
 
05:04:59.590 --> 05:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
if it works the way that you and i are
 
05:05:01.350 --> 05:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
used to working
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it's posted on online
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
and it's what's being actually taught to
 
05:05:07.510 --> 05:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
05:05:09.910 --> 05:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
but most often i should say most often i
 
05:05:11.430 --> 05:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
can't even if who cares if it's a
 
05:05:13.510 --> 05:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
majority of times or not
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
too often
 
05:05:17.590 --> 05:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's not available and a specific
 
05:05:19.990 --> 05:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
request for that curriculum is met with
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
denial like you heard from some of the
 
05:05:23.830 --> 05:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
parents in here now maybe they didn't go
 
05:05:26.070 --> 05:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
about asking the right way i can't
 
05:05:28.628 --> 05:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
you know testify to that
 
05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
but if a parent comes into my office
 
05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
and says to me may i have the you know
 
05:05:37.110 --> 05:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
the curriculum for the uh american
 
05:05:39.910 --> 05:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
history class or geography i'm saying
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and it's going to take me a
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
couple of days let me get it to you
 
05:05:46.070 --> 05:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's not a problem
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
so i regret to say that
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to be facetious but you
 
05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
made my point exactly
 
05:05:55.350 --> 05:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
the curricula too often is not
 
05:05:57.990 --> 05:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
available to parents
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:04.230 --> 05:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
05:06:06.310 --> 05:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i go back to
 
05:06:10.150 --> 05:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
your recent conversation with your 30
 
05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
year old daughter saying that the school
 
05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
was trying to pull her
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
from you did she indicate whether that
 
05:06:18.150 --> 05:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
was successful or close to being
 
05:06:20.310 --> 05:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
successful or
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
so the last thing he said was what
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
whether that was what were supposed to
 
05:06:25.750 --> 05:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
be what
 
05:06:25.760 --> 05:06:26.948 align:start position:0%
be what
that

05:06:26.948 --> 05:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:06:28.628 --> 05:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if if your daughter
 
05:06:31.430 --> 05:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
indicated whether that was successful or
 
05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
close to being successful well that
 
05:06:36.390 --> 05:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
affected her not entirely
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you well first of all with
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
all due respect what difference does
 
05:06:42.628 --> 05:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
that really make if that's what was
 
05:06:43.990 --> 05:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
being done
 
05:06:46.230 --> 05:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
maybe with my daughter
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
who had parents that were willing to
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
fight to fight a little harder than
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
others maybe it wasn't successful
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to tell you without
 
05:06:52.958 --> 05:06:53.830 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to tell you without
getting

05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
getting
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
too much into my personal story
 
05:06:58.868 --> 05:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
i suspect it caused a great deal of
 
05:07:01.510 --> 05:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty in our family a great deal of
 
05:07:01.520 --> 05:07:02.708 align:start position:0%
difficulty in our family a great deal of
difficulty

05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay but we fought the fight and
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
our daughter's with us
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
and for her to come back
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
15 18 years later
 
05:07:15.670 --> 05:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know we suspected this kind of thing
 
05:07:17.350 --> 05:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
i mean we knew it but only in general
 
05:07:19.030 --> 05:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
not the kind of thing you could testify
 
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
about but we knew it my wife was a
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
couple of years ahead of me on this
 
05:07:25.990 --> 05:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay but when my daughter 15 to 18 years
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
later comes back and tells me mom dad
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
this was a specific
 
05:07:36.310 --> 05:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
effort there were specific proactive
 
05:07:36.320 --> 05:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
effort there were specific proactive
practices

05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
practices
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
to pull me away from you
 
05:07:42.948 --> 05:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
and if you think that i'm making up some
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
wackadoodle story you need to talk to
 
05:07:48.070 --> 05:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
more parents this goes on all the time
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
05:07:51.030 --> 05:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
are not the friend
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
the teacher's the friend
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
i hope that addressed your question
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh sure
 
05:08:02.788 --> 05:08:02.798 align:start position:0%

representative yokela
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
05:08:06.160 --> 05:08:07.350 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

05:08:07.350 --> 05:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:08:07.360 --> 05:08:10.310 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:12.230 --> 05:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the
 
05:08:14.708 --> 05:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that paid for the
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum to be produced that it's
 
05:08:18.948 --> 05:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
really their
 
05:08:20.550 --> 05:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum and that they should have
 
05:08:22.150 --> 05:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
access to it and it's not a special
 
05:08:24.390 --> 05:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
right to just parents but actually it's
 
05:08:27.190 --> 05:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
a right of all the taxpayers well yeah
 
05:08:29.350 --> 05:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
quite honestly if you've paid for
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
something you have a right to it
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
um you know whether you have an interest
 
05:08:36.070 --> 05:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
in seeing her you know when you're
 
05:08:37.510 --> 05:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
my age and if you don't have any
 
05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
children maybe it's not that important
 
05:08:39.990 --> 05:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:08:40.000 --> 05:08:40.788 align:start position:0%
to you
but

05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:08:40.798 --> 05:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
but
uh

05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know for instance as an educator not
 
05:08:43.760 --> 05:08:45.030 align:start position:0%
you know for instance as an educator not
even

05:08:45.030 --> 05:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
even
 
05:08:46.550 --> 05:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
currently active
 
05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to go into
 
05:08:48.320 --> 05:08:49.830 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to go into
[Music]

05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:08:51.190 --> 05:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
05:08:53.030 --> 05:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
nashua public school
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
and say hey may i see the curriculum
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
because i'm developing a program of my
 
05:08:59.430 --> 05:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
own and it would be really helpful for
 
05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
me to see this
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
i can't predict the future but if you
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
would like to play that game with me
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
why don't we do that i'll go down there
 
05:09:09.270 --> 05:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
and request it let's see what the reply
 
05:09:09.280 --> 05:09:10.310 align:start position:0%
and request it let's see what the reply
is

05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:09:13.350 --> 05:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
i'll give odds
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
so yes it should be a right to answer
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
your question directly it should be a
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
right yes and what would the reason be
 
05:09:22.788 --> 05:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
none that i can think of
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
not if you're doing the right thing
 
05:09:28.550 --> 05:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know when you've stolen cookies from
 
05:09:29.910 --> 05:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
the cookie jar that's when you tuck them
 
05:09:31.990 --> 05:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
in your pocket not when you've asked and
 
05:09:36.310 --> 05:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:41.830 --> 05:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%

for the better part of a couple years
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
usually screaming outside in the front
 
05:10:08.550 --> 05:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the state house with my flag
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
no mandates freedom
 
05:10:11.910 --> 05:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:18.150 --> 05:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
activity that we need to support
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
so eight weeks ago i decided to come to
 
05:10:20.000 --> 05:10:22.390 align:start position:0%
so eight weeks ago i decided to come to
a

05:10:22.390 --> 05:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:10:24.150 --> 05:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
hearing about house bill i can't
 
05:10:26.230 --> 05:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
remember when it was but i looked at all
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
of them and said you know what maybe i
 
05:10:29.590 --> 05:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
want to go up there and testify for
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
freedom no mandates
 
05:10:33.750 --> 05:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i've
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
been on the freedom side of most of
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
these most of us here this morning were
 
05:10:38.000 --> 05:10:38.868 align:start position:0%
these most of us here this morning were
and

05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
are at just about every single meeting
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
other than hospital administrators and
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
paid lobbyists
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
i've come to one conclusion
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
on either side
 
05:10:50.550 --> 05:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
that we
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
as adults have effectively been
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
torturing our children for two years
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
literally torturing my daughter is a
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
freshman at keene state college i'll be
 
05:11:01.510 --> 05:11:01.520 align:start position:0%

05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
05:11:04.470 --> 05:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
on her bed with a computer graduating
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
from manchester central high school
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
was she clinically depressed i don't

know i'm not a shrink
 
05:11:11.590 --> 05:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
she was not herself for
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
the better part of a year she gets into
 
05:11:15.430 --> 05:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
college goes to keene state has a great
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
first semester
 
05:11:19.990 --> 05:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
3.37 yay
 
05:11:22.150 --> 05:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
one week into second semester she gets a
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
visit from a student advocate um i know
 
05:11:26.788 --> 05:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
her name's kathy that's all i know
 
05:11:28.070 --> 05:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
goes through a whole bunch of stuff with
 
05:11:30.150 --> 05:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
my daughter how was your first semester
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
yada yada she gets the end of it she
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
says so courtney um i understand you're
 
05:11:36.390 --> 05:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
not vaccinated
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
my daughter's
 
05:11:39.510 --> 05:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
no i'm not but
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
why is it your business well you might
 
05:11:42.550 --> 05:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
as well get vaccinated because you're
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
going to need a vaccination to graduate
 
05:11:45.430 --> 05:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
from keene state college in three and a
 
05:11:47.350 --> 05:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
half years so my daughter calls me up
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
crying dad what do i do what do i do
 
05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
what do i do i said well you don't get
 
05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated first of all and that's not a
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
fact yet and we hope it's not going to
 
05:11:55.200 --> 05:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
fact yet and we hope it's not going to
be

05:11:55.910 --> 05:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:11:57.110 --> 05:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
the point is
 
05:11:59.590 --> 05:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
our kids have been like i said tortured
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
for the better part of two years and
 
05:12:04.390 --> 05:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
the only common denominator is covin we
 
05:12:06.550 --> 05:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
all know that masks and
 
05:12:08.788 --> 05:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
isolation i just really need you to get
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the text of this bill
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do
 
05:12:14.400 --> 05:12:15.270 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do
is

05:12:15.270 --> 05:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:12:17.350 --> 05:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
take the government out of our kids
 
05:12:19.190 --> 05:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
lives and give it back to the parents
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
the point is that the government has
 
05:12:22.868 --> 05:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
really been torturing our kids like i'm
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
i don't want to make my kids wear masks
 
05:12:26.550 --> 05:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
in schools but the schools and the
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
government are making me do it so
 
05:12:31.510 --> 05:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is give this bill
 
05:12:33.110 --> 05:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there i
 
05:12:35.350 --> 05:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
talked to a couple of you after and
 
05:12:38.070 --> 05:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
there are tweaks that need to be done
 
05:12:40.230 --> 05:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
but for anybody to sit here and say that
 
05:12:41.910 --> 05:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
the school should have more rights over
 
05:12:44.550 --> 05:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
our kids than the parents you're crazy
 
05:12:45.910 --> 05:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
and if you don't think this is happening
 
05:12:48.470 --> 05:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire my final point here
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
is this letter was written
 
05:12:50.958 --> 05:12:51.830 align:start position:0%
is this letter was written
to

05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:12:54.070 --> 05:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
the house education committee
 
05:12:56.788 --> 05:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
please vote no on house bill 1015. we're
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
not talking about that bill but
 
05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
reference it's basically a bill saying
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
that if you're teaching health or sex
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
education you're going to need to give
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
the curriculum ahead of time so the
 
05:13:07.990 --> 05:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
parents can opt out if they'd like to
 
05:13:10.390 --> 05:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
sounds common sense to me
 
05:13:12.868 --> 05:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
the letter goes on to say your calling
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
is to the legislature
 
05:13:17.590 --> 05:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
others are called to medicine
 
05:13:20.230 --> 05:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
teachers are called to teach let us do
 
05:13:21.990 --> 05:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
our jobs without interference from
 
05:13:25.670 --> 05:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
parents and laws do your job and vote no
 
05:13:28.150 --> 05:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
so we can do our job and teach
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
that was submitted
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
by the president of the teachers
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
association at timberlane high school
 
05:13:34.948 --> 05:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
timberlane school district i'm not going
 
05:13:36.788 --> 05:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
to say her name you can find that out
 
05:13:39.910 --> 05:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
yourself but for somebody in charge to
 
05:13:41.670 --> 05:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
have that much arrogance
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
me me me it's it's
 
05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
disgusting and by the way if we want to
 
05:13:50.310 --> 05:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
end all this covid i know i'm not
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to talk about this bill either
 
05:13:54.628 --> 05:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
but if you fast track bill 1022 iver
 
05:13:58.628 --> 05:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.350 --> 05:14:07.360 align:start position:0%

good afternoon
 
05:14:17.430 --> 05:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
my name is anne-marie banfield i'm a
 
05:14:18.868 --> 05:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
parental rights advocate in new
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire who is primarily focused on
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
academic excellence and education today
 
05:14:25.990 --> 05:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
come to urge you to vote ought to pass
 
05:14:28.948 --> 05:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1431.
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
i've been working as a parental rights
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
advocate in new hampshire for about 15
 
05:14:33.360 --> 05:14:34.708 align:start position:0%
advocate in new hampshire for about 15
years

05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:14:36.310 --> 05:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
i tend to be in front of the house
 
05:14:38.310 --> 05:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
education committee so thank you for
 
05:14:40.390 --> 05:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony today they know me
 
05:14:43.030 --> 05:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
pretty well over there
 
05:14:44.470 --> 05:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's also important to mention
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
that in that time i have never received
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
a diamond compensation
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
my focus is on academic excellence in
 
05:14:54.550 --> 05:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
education so much of the time has been
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
spent again
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
reporting before the house education
 
05:14:58.718 --> 05:15:00.150 align:start position:0%
reporting before the house education
committee

05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:15:02.230 --> 05:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
parents who struggled
 
05:15:03.750 --> 05:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be a voice for their children
 
05:15:05.670 --> 05:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes run into lobbying
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
organizations that are well-funded
 
05:15:10.470 --> 05:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
and hire high-priced attorneys
 
05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
to fight against them
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
the irony is that those organizations
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
and individuals are paid out of the
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
school budget through dues
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
in essence parents pay the salaries of
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
those attorneys and lobbyists who are
 
05:15:24.310 --> 05:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
hired to fight against them
 
05:15:26.470 --> 05:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
i would assume that some of them will
 
05:15:29.990 --> 05:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
probably have opposed this bill or may
 
05:15:31.670 --> 05:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
i want to make it clear again that i
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
have no financial stake in advocating
 
05:15:36.550 --> 05:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
i've done this on behalf of parents and
 
05:15:38.868 --> 05:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
i'm here today because it's the right
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
05:15:42.788 --> 05:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
school administrators have high priced
 
05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
legal teams that can be extremely
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
intimidating to parents not to mention
 
05:15:48.868 --> 05:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
they are there to protect the school
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
system the balance of power has been
 
05:15:53.430 --> 05:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
against parents for many years
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
even if parents have a good case the
 
05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
legal cost of them to fight a
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent who can use
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded attorneys results in
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
parents giving up they tend to just
 
05:16:06.310 --> 05:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
leave the public schools you want why
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
enrollments dropping
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
public school enrollment declines
 
05:16:13.110 --> 05:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
private schools and home school numbers
 
05:16:15.990 --> 05:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
increase in the state check the data
 
05:16:17.910 --> 05:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
a parental rights bill would help shift
 
05:16:20.150 --> 05:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
some of that power back to the parents
 
05:16:22.628 --> 05:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
i've seen parents lose court cases after
 
05:16:25.110 --> 05:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
their children were assaulted
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
in school manchester student drug down
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
the stairs by her hair
 
05:16:33.430 --> 05:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
lost a lawsuit
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
parents have been denied access to their
 
05:16:38.230 --> 05:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
child's classroom to obser observe
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
i want to add that that is an extremely
 
05:16:40.798 --> 05:16:41.910 align:start position:0%
i want to add that that is an extremely
rare

05:16:41.910 --> 05:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
rare
 
05:16:44.310 --> 05:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
request by a parent most parents don't
 
05:16:46.150 --> 05:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
want to go into a classroom and observe
 
05:16:47.590 --> 05:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
number one you know sometimes it
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
embarrasses their kids
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
um but it does happen in the 15 years
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
i've had two
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
two parents i don't think you're going
 
05:16:57.350 --> 05:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
to see this influx of parents into the
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
classroom i've had two parents contact
 
05:16:59.200 --> 05:17:00.070 align:start position:0%
classroom i've had two parents contact
me

05:17:00.070 --> 05:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:17:01.190 --> 05:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
when i think we're going to hear from
 
05:17:01.200 --> 05:17:02.788 align:start position:0%
when i think we're going to hear from
today

05:17:02.788 --> 05:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
in one of the cases many years ago i had
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
to turn to former state senator peter
 
05:17:09.670 --> 05:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
bragdon who had also served on the
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
school board in his town
 
05:17:13.510 --> 05:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
he managed to facilitate a father's
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
request to observe his child's classroom
 
05:17:19.590 --> 05:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't have to reach out to a state
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
senator in order to pull some strings
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
just so a parent can observe their
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
child's classroom
 
05:17:30.150 --> 05:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
these parents are good parents they want
 
05:17:32.788 --> 05:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
to figure out what's going on
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
how can i help the teacher most of the
 
05:17:37.670 --> 05:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
time it's because there's a problem that
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed and maybe if they
 
05:17:41.190 --> 05:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
saw their kid in action they would
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
actually be supporting the teacher i
 
05:17:44.310 --> 05:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
public schools are public everything
 
05:17:48.150 --> 05:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
should be made transparent unless there
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
is a reason to keep a student's personal
 
05:17:52.390 --> 05:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
information private
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
from the curriculum to the materials to
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
the classroom nothing should be hidden
 
05:17:59.910 --> 05:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
from parents but it is
 
05:18:01.670 --> 05:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment continues to drop in new
 
05:18:03.670 --> 05:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire schools there are various
 
05:18:05.350 --> 05:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
reasons for this trend but i also
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
believe that if parents have some
 
05:18:09.910 --> 05:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights to exercise they may
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
be more likely to keep their children in
 
05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
the public schools if they leave they
 
05:18:16.390 --> 05:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
take a portion of that money and the
 
05:18:19.270 --> 05:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
school loses that money
 
05:18:21.110 --> 05:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
um just that's the end of my testimony
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to bring up some
 
05:18:23.910 --> 05:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
points that i think
 
05:18:26.230 --> 05:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
might help in some of this that's been
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:31.750 --> 05:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
what is in federal law
 
05:18:34.550 --> 05:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
and what guides schools sometimes
 
05:18:37.350 --> 05:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
will also have loopholes
 
05:18:37.360 --> 05:18:38.470 align:start position:0%
will also have loopholes
so

05:18:38.470 --> 05:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:41.110 --> 05:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
you might say well if this law
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
as it's presented
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
already is in federal law well let me
 
05:18:47.590 --> 05:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
tell you something school administrators
 
05:18:47.600 --> 05:18:48.390 align:start position:0%
tell you something school administrators
will

05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
exploit any
 
05:18:52.310 --> 05:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
loophole in those laws and i've seen it
 
05:18:54.150 --> 05:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
i've seen it firsthand it's why we have
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
the non-academic survey law in law in
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:19:01.590 --> 05:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
because the ppra federal law which is
 
05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to require parental consent for
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys that law was
 
05:19:08.470 --> 05:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
exploited by administrators
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
administrators said we don't need
 
05:19:11.590 --> 05:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
parental consent on these non-academic
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
surveys because in the federal law
 
05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
it says if a student is required to take
 
05:19:19.190 --> 05:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
a survey
 
05:19:23.670 --> 05:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
we don't require the students this is
 
05:19:27.670 --> 05:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary now when you put a survey in
 
05:19:29.110 --> 05:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
front of a student
 
05:19:30.868 --> 05:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
they think it's a test they take a test
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
they put your name on it they put their
 
05:19:34.948 --> 05:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
unique people identifier number on it
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing anonymous about those
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
surveys as we have found so there are
 
05:19:41.110 --> 05:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
loopholes oftentimes in these federal
 
05:19:44.070 --> 05:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
laws this would help close those
 
05:19:44.080 --> 05:19:45.750 align:start position:0%
laws this would help close those
loopholes

05:19:45.750 --> 05:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
loopholes
 
05:19:48.230 --> 05:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
state law does that
 
05:19:50.390 --> 05:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
i have personally filed right to no
 
05:19:52.868 --> 05:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
request in some of these schools sau 16
 
05:19:54.470 --> 05:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
being one of them
 
05:19:56.470 --> 05:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know when i get back i'll get back
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
some documents and then some of the
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
questions they won't answer
 
05:20:02.070 --> 05:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
they won't answer
 
05:20:03.830 --> 05:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
now i've filed right to know requested
 
05:20:06.390 --> 05:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
merrimack where not only did they answer
 
05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
the question sometimes they give me all
 
05:20:10.948 --> 05:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
kinds of information it depends on where
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
you file that right to know request we
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
have had school board members have to
 
05:20:18.070 --> 05:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
file a right to know request to get
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
information doris hoencey in nashua who
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
used to sit on their school board had to
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
file right to no request and again had
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
trouble getting information from the
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
district where she served donna green
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
had to take her school district
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
timberlane to the supreme court
 
05:20:37.430 --> 05:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
to get information
 
05:20:39.270 --> 05:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
so you can imagine how difficult it can
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
be for parents i can't even get the
 
05:20:43.270 --> 05:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
information sometimes and then if you
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
have to go to court
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
well thousands and thousands of dollars
 
05:20:49.110 --> 05:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
but you know what the superintendents i
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
am just about finished thank you for
 
05:20:53.350 --> 05:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
your patience superintendents they have
 
05:20:55.910 --> 05:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded attorneys so they can
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
rake up the bill
 
05:20:59.350 --> 05:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
they can fight these parents and they
 
05:20:59.360 --> 05:21:00.230 align:start position:0%
they can fight these parents and they
are

05:21:00.230 --> 05:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:21:02.470 --> 05:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
we have court cases going on right now
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
where superintendents will not provide
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
information because they have those
 
05:21:08.310 --> 05:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys available i'm happy to take
 
05:21:11.350 --> 05:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
any questions um i can tell you that the
 
05:21:12.948 --> 05:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
gentleman who spoke before me when it
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
comes to crt was right on the money
 
05:21:18.628 --> 05:21:18.638 align:start position:0%

05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
you have any questions
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
up next is laura ellazam
 
05:21:38.310 --> 05:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the bill for one
 
05:21:38.320 --> 05:21:43.590 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the bill for one
minute

05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon i'm laura elazam from
 
05:21:46.480 --> 05:21:48.070 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon i'm laura elazam from
londonderry

05:21:48.070 --> 05:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
londonderry
 
05:21:50.470 --> 05:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
i consider myself very fortunate that my
 
05:21:53.270 --> 05:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
children attend a school that explicitly
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
affirms parents as the natural primary
 
05:21:58.628 --> 05:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
educators and caretakers of their minor
 
05:21:58.638 --> 05:22:00.150 align:start position:0%
educators and caretakers of their minor
children

05:22:00.150 --> 05:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:22:01.750 --> 05:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is both our right and our
 
05:22:01.760 --> 05:22:03.590 align:start position:0%
this is both our right and our
responsibility

05:22:03.590 --> 05:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
and you know the system works really
 
05:22:05.920 --> 05:22:06.788 align:start position:0%
and you know the system works really
well

05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:22:06.798 --> 05:22:08.310 align:start position:0%
well
um

05:22:08.310 --> 05:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:09.910 --> 05:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
when parents are treated that way it
 
05:22:12.548 --> 05:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
fosters trust and accountability and
 
05:22:14.548 --> 05:22:14.558 align:start position:0%
cooperation between the administrators
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
and the and the teachers and the parents
 
05:22:18.788 --> 05:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
and that's good for the students
 
05:22:20.470 --> 05:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
and actually it's kind of been the
 
05:22:23.190 --> 05:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
default situation all around until
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
fairly recently
 
05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
but now my school's attitude has become
 
05:22:29.270 --> 05:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
increasingly uncommon
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
more and more we see an erosion in
 
05:22:32.948 --> 05:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
parental prerogative
 
05:22:34.788 --> 05:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
in some districts in some schools
 
05:22:36.628 --> 05:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
there's open hostility to parental
 
05:22:36.638 --> 05:22:37.910 align:start position:0%
there's open hostility to parental
involvement

05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
05:22:39.430 --> 05:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
at every level
 
05:22:41.110 --> 05:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
it is the national school board
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
association that labeled parents who
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
sought answers at school boards
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
domestic terrorists i mean
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's chilling and it was designed to
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
be chilling we don't want to hear from
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
people who disagree with our policies is
 
05:22:55.270 --> 05:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
the attitude of some of these school
 
05:22:55.280 --> 05:22:56.548 align:start position:0%
the attitude of some of these school
boards

05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
boards
 
05:22:58.390 --> 05:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
so enough is enough
 
05:23:00.070 --> 05:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
the stuff that used to go without saying
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't anymore and i feel that this
 
05:23:04.788 --> 05:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
bill really addresses that
 
05:23:07.030 --> 05:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
parents who have children at schools
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
other than my unique school
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
particularly taxpayer-funded schools
 
05:23:15.750 --> 05:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
they deserve better
 
05:23:18.150 --> 05:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
and they deserve to see their children
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
reaping the benefits of respectful
 
05:23:22.868 --> 05:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
collaboration between families and
 
05:23:22.878 --> 05:23:23.990 align:start position:0%
collaboration between families and
schools

05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:23:26.310 --> 05:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
everyone benefits
 
05:23:29.350 --> 05:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
so please tweak this bill if necessary
 
05:23:31.750 --> 05:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
but pass a comprehensive parental bill
 
05:23:33.190 --> 05:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
of rights for the benefit of our
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
students and of our school communities
 
05:23:37.110 --> 05:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.230 --> 05:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
up next is eric anthony
 
05:23:51.750 --> 05:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the bill for
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:05.430 --> 05:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
my name is eric anthony i'm from auburn
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i thank you for the
 
05:24:09.030 --> 05:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity can you just move a little
 
05:24:11.350 --> 05:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
closer thank you for the opportunity to
 
05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
address you on this important matter
 
05:24:15.990 --> 05:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm doing so from the standpoint of
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
a case that i'm involved in in salem
 
05:24:19.510 --> 05:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
district court
 
05:24:21.670 --> 05:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's bossy versus
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
state versus bosse
 
05:24:25.830 --> 05:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
and the primary
 
05:24:27.670 --> 05:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
she was arrested
 
05:24:29.190 --> 05:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
for not wearing a mask in a school
 
05:24:29.200 --> 05:24:31.030 align:start position:0%
for not wearing a mask in a school
meeting

05:24:31.030 --> 05:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
and this is after the school board had
 
05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
put out a notice a week earlier that
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
said precisely that mass the attendees
 
05:24:43.590 --> 05:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
were asked to wear a mask
 
05:24:45.750 --> 05:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
a reasonable interpretation of that was
 
05:24:48.150 --> 05:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
that masks were optional
 
05:24:49.830 --> 05:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
especially this being
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
about three weeks after the governor's
 
05:24:55.190 --> 05:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
order public order rescinding
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
the mask mandates
 
05:24:58.320 --> 05:25:00.230 align:start position:0%
the mask mandates
so

05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:25:01.910 --> 05:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
she went to the meeting she expected to
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
speak she actually got into the area
 
05:25:05.040 --> 05:25:06.548 align:start position:0%
speak she actually got into the area
where

05:25:06.548 --> 05:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:25:08.788 --> 05:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
where people could be
 
05:25:08.798 --> 05:25:09.990 align:start position:0%
where people could be
seated

05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
seated
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
and she realized a friend of hers was
 
05:25:14.230 --> 05:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
back in the hall area so she turned
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
around went back
 
05:25:15.840 --> 05:25:17.350 align:start position:0%
around went back
and

05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
she said i'm just going in you know he
 
05:25:22.390 --> 05:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
was in in a conversation with the police
 
05:25:22.400 --> 05:25:23.430 align:start position:0%
was in in a conversation with the police
there

05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:25:26.070 --> 05:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
the police had by a second order by the
 
05:25:27.510 --> 05:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
same school board
 
05:25:29.590 --> 05:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
have been told to come they expected
 
05:25:32.310 --> 05:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
some controversy and they were told to
 
05:25:35.990 --> 05:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
block and arrest anybody without a mask
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
so uh she was
 
05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
at that point a police officer turned
 
05:25:42.310 --> 05:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
around grabbed her and arrested her so
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
is this a student no this is a parent
 
05:25:46.470 --> 05:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
this is a grandparent specifically she
 
05:25:48.868 --> 05:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
was there with her daughter son
 
05:25:50.628 --> 05:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
and granddaughter and she planned to
 
05:25:53.190 --> 05:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
speak at the meeting
 
05:25:53.200 --> 05:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
speak at the meeting
and

05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:55.990 --> 05:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
so this
 
05:25:57.190 --> 05:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
sets up a
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
conflict of law is it so
 
05:26:02.708 --> 05:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
elemental so classic it goes back i
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
think before the magna carta
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's called it's called an ex post facto
 
05:26:07.360 --> 05:26:08.230 align:start position:0%
it's called it's called an ex post facto
law

05:26:08.230 --> 05:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:26:10.150 --> 05:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
where somebody where she was given the
 
05:26:12.310 --> 05:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
expectation the printed expectation that
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
she could enter the meeting without
 
05:26:16.548 --> 05:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask then she was arrested for
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask
 
05:26:20.070 --> 05:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
but but so
 
05:26:23.590 --> 05:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
this bill wouldn't change that
 
05:26:26.230 --> 05:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
right this this bill is about wearing a
 
05:26:28.230 --> 05:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
mask to a meeting that's totally
 
05:26:30.708 --> 05:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
different this is about parental rights
 
05:26:32.230 --> 05:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
over their children
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
but this is squarely in your
 
05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:42.628 --> 05:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
for children for overseeing the children
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
though right this isn't about an adult
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
do you know what i'm saying
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
you you have you have granted these
 
05:26:54.390 --> 05:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
school boards in effect starting i
 
05:26:56.310 --> 05:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
haven't granted the school boards the
 
05:26:58.230 --> 05:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
school board would refer back to the
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
statutes they'd refer up to the chain of
 
05:27:00.240 --> 05:27:01.270 align:start position:0%
statutes they'd refer up to the chain of
command

05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
command
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
these school boards think that they've
 
05:27:03.910 --> 05:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
been granted
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
in effect star chamber justice
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
to mete out the laws and they they are
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
the law and they say when
 
05:27:13.030 --> 05:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
they are the law and
 
05:27:15.590 --> 05:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
you have no no choice or
 
05:27:15.600 --> 05:27:21.030 align:start position:0%
you have no no choice or
recourse

05:27:21.030 --> 05:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:22.788 --> 05:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
i understand but this bill does not
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
change the fact that the school board's
 
05:27:25.120 --> 05:27:26.548 align:start position:0%
change the fact that the school board's
requiring

05:27:26.548 --> 05:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
parents to wear masks to a meeting okay
 
05:27:30.470 --> 05:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
this is about parents rights over their
 
05:27:30.480 --> 05:27:32.150 align:start position:0%
this is about parents rights over their
children

05:27:32.150 --> 05:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
it speaks to governmental authorities if
 
05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:42.948 --> 05:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
a parent of a minor child has
 
05:27:45.430 --> 05:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
inalienable rights that now are more
 
05:27:48.310 --> 05:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than those listed in
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:54.150 --> 05:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm gonna let you go on but i'm
 
05:27:56.070 --> 05:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
going to tell you that that's not what
 
05:27:57.510 --> 05:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does
 
05:27:57.520 --> 05:27:58.708 align:start position:0%
this bill does
okay

05:27:58.708 --> 05:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:28:01.270 --> 05:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
so you can you can continue but because
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to argue with me regardless
 
05:28:05.590 --> 05:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm just making it clear to you that
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
this bill does not stop a school board
 
05:28:10.070 --> 05:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
from acquiring meetings of masks at a
 
05:28:10.080 --> 05:28:11.110 align:start position:0%
from acquiring meetings of masks at a
meeting

05:28:11.110 --> 05:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:28:11.120 --> 05:28:13.750 align:start position:0%
meeting
okay

05:28:13.750 --> 05:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
right anne marie because i see you
 
05:28:17.590 --> 05:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
shaking your head you know right
 
05:28:20.548 --> 05:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
a parental bill of rights in any case
 
05:28:22.708 --> 05:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
because this is a travesty this person's
 
05:28:26.470 --> 05:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
civil rights parental rights have been
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
wholesale have been violated
 
05:28:29.040 --> 05:28:30.230 align:start position:0%
wholesale have been violated
and

05:28:30.230 --> 05:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:28:33.990 --> 05:28:34.000 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
i've been doing a lot of activity here
 
05:29:23.190 --> 05:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
in both
 
05:29:24.868 --> 05:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
representatives hall and over in the
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
legislative building uh since
 
05:29:30.548 --> 05:29:30.558 align:start position:0%
i have realized that one of the problems
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
in our state is the fact that
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
we as citizens
 
05:29:38.948 --> 05:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayers parents
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
have lost faith
 
05:29:44.548 --> 05:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
we've lost faith in the transparency
 
05:29:46.708 --> 05:29:46.718 align:start position:0%
and the integrity
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
of so many of our lives not just our
 
05:29:51.510 --> 05:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
lives but our children's lives
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
one of the nice things that covet 19 did
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
because i like to look through
 
05:29:56.708 --> 05:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
everything through heroes colored
 
05:29:59.830 --> 05:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
glasses is it put parents back more
 
05:30:01.990 --> 05:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
involved with their children's lives
 
05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
isn't that's what our educators have
 
05:30:06.150 --> 05:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
been crying about for so long the
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
teachers are not involved
 
05:30:08.320 --> 05:30:09.110 align:start position:0%
teachers are not involved
um

05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:11.670 --> 05:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
i wanted to talk a little bit about
 
05:30:15.270 --> 05:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
sorry i want to talk a little bit about
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
some of the things
 
05:30:20.310 --> 05:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
that i believe and i know has been
 
05:30:22.470 --> 05:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
happening for years i can tell you
 
05:30:25.830 --> 05:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
stories about my fifth grade child who
 
05:30:28.948 --> 05:30:28.958 align:start position:0%
was physically abused by a teacher
 
05:30:33.910 --> 05:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
she was a drama queen
 
05:30:38.948 --> 05:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
i didn't believe her
 
05:30:41.270 --> 05:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
to this day
 
05:30:44.628 --> 05:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
i cannot forgive myself
 
05:30:47.430 --> 05:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
for taking the side of that teacher over
 
05:30:49.750 --> 05:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
the side of my child
 
05:30:53.670 --> 05:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
and if i had not found that suicide note
 
05:30:55.350 --> 05:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
in the trash can
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
i may never
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
have been able to see my grandchildren
 
05:31:01.440 --> 05:31:02.150 align:start position:0%
have been able to see my grandchildren
or

05:31:02.150 --> 05:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
be in at her wedding
 
05:31:07.110 --> 05:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
because when i found that suicide note
 
05:31:08.470 --> 05:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
i finally said
 
05:31:08.480 --> 05:31:09.350 align:start position:0%
i finally said
okay

05:31:09.350 --> 05:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:11.350 --> 05:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
what's going on and i tried to talk to
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
my child about it and she said
 
05:31:16.948 --> 05:31:16.958 align:start position:0%

05:31:18.070 --> 05:31:18.080 align:start position:0%

05:31:24.070 --> 05:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
this teacher was doing to other kids and
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
you didn't believe me and you didn't
 
05:31:27.510 --> 05:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
want to do anything about it
 
05:31:30.868 --> 05:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
so why should i talk to you now
 
05:31:33.910 --> 05:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
i immediately marched to school and said
 
05:31:35.430 --> 05:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
i want my child removed from this
 
05:31:35.440 --> 05:31:36.788 align:start position:0%
i want my child removed from this
classroom

05:31:36.788 --> 05:31:36.798 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
what happened was they said no
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
we've already had to remove 16 children
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
from that classroom since the beginning
 
05:31:46.470 --> 05:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
of the school year i was like
 
05:31:46.480 --> 05:31:47.350 align:start position:0%
of the school year i was like
whoa

05:31:47.350 --> 05:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
whoa
 
05:31:47.360 --> 05:31:49.510 align:start position:0%
whoa
what

05:31:49.510 --> 05:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
what are you talking about yes but it's
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
all the children the children are the
 
05:31:56.548 --> 05:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
problem your child is socially
 
05:31:58.868 --> 05:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
emotionally disturbed
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
and you need to do something about it
 
05:32:03.110 --> 05:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
and you need to get in our counseling
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
and i said
 
05:32:04.480 --> 05:32:05.750 align:start position:0%
and i said
so

05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
this is the 17th child
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
i started doing a little investigation
 
05:32:12.788 --> 05:32:12.798 align:start position:0%
on the teacher
 
05:32:15.510 --> 05:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
she had been moved seven times in the
 
05:32:17.670 --> 05:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
last two years through the school
 
05:32:17.680 --> 05:32:18.788 align:start position:0%
last two years through the school
district

05:32:18.788 --> 05:32:18.798 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:32:21.270 --> 05:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
because of complaints against her
 
05:32:24.150 --> 05:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
at no point in time was the public ever
 
05:32:26.708 --> 05:32:26.718 align:start position:0%
made aware of what was going on at no
 
05:32:29.590 --> 05:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
point in time did the school principals
 
05:32:32.788 --> 05:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
or the school district or anyone try to
 
05:32:38.070 --> 05:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:40.628 --> 05:32:40.638 align:start position:0%
there are the reason why we're begging
 
05:32:43.190 --> 05:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
for this parental rights bill is because
 
05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
the school boards the school districts
 
05:32:49.110 --> 05:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
the teachers the counselors all have big
 
05:32:51.270 --> 05:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
money behind them they all have the
 
05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
protection of the new hampshire
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
counselors association and the new
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire teachers association and
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
what did parents have
 
05:33:04.390 --> 05:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
really what do parents have now
 
05:33:08.070 --> 05:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
we have stripped away parental rights in
 
05:33:10.788 --> 05:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
this state and in this country we have
 
05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
also said you know what teachers you
 
05:33:15.110 --> 05:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
know better than we do we're just going
 
05:33:18.390 --> 05:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:20.310 --> 05:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
what i know
 
05:33:20.320 --> 05:33:22.390 align:start position:0%
what i know
is

05:33:22.390 --> 05:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:33:25.830 --> 05:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect of children in the
 
05:33:30.868 --> 05:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
schools is up
 
05:33:33.910 --> 05:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
test grades are down
 
05:33:36.470 --> 05:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
school enrollment is down
 
05:33:40.830 --> 05:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
school proportion of taxes is way up
 
05:33:44.230 --> 05:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
why i feel very strongly
 
05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
that it's because
 
05:33:48.150 --> 05:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
parents are starting to
 
05:33:51.670 --> 05:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
find teeth and find people to represent
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
them and litigate the kind of things
 
05:33:55.990 --> 05:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
that i should have been able to do as a
 
05:33:58.788 --> 05:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
single parent but i could not
 
05:34:02.788 --> 05:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
this parental right bill gives parents
 
05:34:05.910 --> 05:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
the resources to fight back against the
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
bad educators against the bad
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
administrations and against the bad
 
05:34:13.270 --> 05:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
school boards and i will tell you it's
 
05:34:15.750 --> 05:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
not it didn't just start happening
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
recently this happened over 25 years ago
 
05:34:23.190 --> 05:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
in this state in this in this city
 
05:34:25.190 --> 05:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
i can also tell you another story where
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
my other child
 
05:34:26.958 --> 05:34:28.310 align:start position:0%
my other child
um

05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
was the the school counselor took it
 
05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
upon herself to make the decision that
 
05:34:36.868 --> 05:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
she was a neglected and or emotionally
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
disturbed child or neglected or abused
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
child my stepdaughter was neglected and
 
05:34:44.948 --> 05:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
or abused not by me
 
05:34:48.310 --> 05:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
but by a previous guardian
 
05:34:50.830 --> 05:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
the school teacher the the school
 
05:34:53.190 --> 05:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
counselor and the school teacher took it
 
05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
upon themselves to take that child under
 
05:34:58.230 --> 05:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
their wings and say
 
05:35:00.548 --> 05:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
this is safe this is a safe place you
 
05:35:02.070 --> 05:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about anything
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's going on at home
 
05:35:06.230 --> 05:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
you can talk to us don't talk to your
 
05:35:08.470 --> 05:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
parents because obviously they're the
 
05:35:08.480 --> 05:35:10.788 align:start position:0%
parents because obviously they're the
problem

05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:35:13.590 --> 05:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
a report was made to dcs
 
05:35:16.310 --> 05:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
who i worked for at the time i was a
 
05:35:18.390 --> 05:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
child protective service worker for 17
 
05:35:21.510 --> 05:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
years in this state
 
05:35:23.350 --> 05:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
i was told because there was an
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
investigation i had to move out of my
 
05:35:25.680 --> 05:35:27.030 align:start position:0%
investigation i had to move out of my
home

05:35:27.030 --> 05:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
home
 
05:35:29.910 --> 05:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
or my child would be put into foster
 
05:35:29.920 --> 05:35:30.868 align:start position:0%
or my child would be put into foster
care

05:35:30.868 --> 05:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:35:34.310 --> 05:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
i moved out of my home for six months
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
05:35:38.150 --> 05:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
my child
 
05:35:39.910 --> 05:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
my my
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
husband did not believe that anything
 
05:35:45.030 --> 05:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
bad had ever happened to the child
 
05:35:48.150 --> 05:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
so he took her off all his all her meds
 
05:35:51.350 --> 05:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
he took her out of counseling
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
and my child ended up in the criminal
 
05:35:57.430 --> 05:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
justice system in this state because she
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
attacked a teacher
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
and it was all because a counselor
 
05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
thought it was a good idea to make a
 
05:36:07.350 --> 05:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
report instead of having a conversation
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that's happened
 
05:36:10.230 --> 05:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
in our society there are no
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
conversations between teachers and
 
05:36:14.548 --> 05:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
school boards and parents and and
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
students anymore
 
05:36:18.548 --> 05:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
i can talk about my son
 
05:36:20.470 --> 05:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
my son who said
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
yeah when i wanted to come out
 
05:36:25.510 --> 05:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
i my teacher told me don't come out to
 
05:36:28.310 --> 05:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
your parents now fortunately she liked
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
me but she didn't like the the
 
05:36:31.200 --> 05:36:33.110 align:start position:0%
me but she didn't like the the
ex-husband

05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
ex-husband
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
so and we had 50-50 custody
 
05:36:36.718 --> 05:36:38.628 align:start position:0%
so and we had 50-50 custody
so

05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:40.390 --> 05:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
my son
 
05:36:42.868 --> 05:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
makes the decision that my husband can't
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
be true my ex-husband can't be trusted
 
05:36:46.480 --> 05:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
be true my ex-husband can't be trusted
fortunately

05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
we were
 
05:36:49.440 --> 05:36:50.230 align:start position:0%

he when my son came out to me
 
05:37:02.230 --> 05:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
i was able to help him
 
05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
coordinate conversations with his father
 
05:37:08.230 --> 05:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
i had no idea at that time that the
 
05:37:11.510 --> 05:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
teacher said don't tell
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%

05:38:05.670 --> 05:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
school books in the classroom
 
05:38:05.680 --> 05:38:07.190 align:start position:0%
school books in the classroom
um

05:38:07.190 --> 05:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:08.548 --> 05:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
and they said
 
05:38:11.510 --> 05:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the argument was we shouldn't ban
 
05:38:11.520 --> 05:38:12.470 align:start position:0%
and the argument was we shouldn't ban
books

05:38:12.470 --> 05:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
books
 
05:38:12.480 --> 05:38:13.830 align:start position:0%
books
okay

05:38:13.830 --> 05:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:38:15.830 --> 05:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
the parents said okay let's talk about
 
05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
this how about if instead of having a
 
05:38:19.200 --> 05:38:19.990 align:start position:0%
this how about if instead of having a
book

05:38:19.990 --> 05:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
book
 
05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
that is inappropriate for a middle
 
05:38:22.000 --> 05:38:23.190 align:start position:0%
that is inappropriate for a middle
school

05:38:23.190 --> 05:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:38:23.200 --> 05:38:24.310 align:start position:0%
school
student

05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:38:24.320 --> 05:38:25.750 align:start position:0%
student
available

05:38:25.750 --> 05:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:38:25.760 --> 05:38:27.110 align:start position:0%
available
from

05:38:27.110 --> 05:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:38:30.230 --> 05:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
age five all the way up
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
instead of that let's put some
 
05:38:33.910 --> 05:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions on it within the school
 
05:38:36.390 --> 05:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
library or within the classroom
 
05:38:39.750 --> 05:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
so that parents are aware
 
05:38:42.470 --> 05:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
the school board the school board said
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that sounds like a great the school
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
district said yeah that sounds like a
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
great idea they went behind the parents
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
back and voted four to zero to allow
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
that book in with no no stipulation
 
05:38:54.390 --> 05:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that's a reality we can't
 
05:38:56.230 --> 05:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
trust our school boards we can't trust
 
05:38:59.030 --> 05:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
our school districts and unfortunately
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:06.548 --> 05:39:06.558 align:start position:0%
we can't trust any aspect of our
 
05:39:09.190 --> 05:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
children's lives anymore do i think it's
 
05:39:11.670 --> 05:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
on purpose do i think it's by accident
 
05:39:13.430 --> 05:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
do i think it's just that there's some
 
05:39:17.110 --> 05:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
nefarious people in every aspect of our
 
05:39:21.750 --> 05:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:23.430 --> 05:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
05:39:26.788 --> 05:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation would allow
 
05:39:29.510 --> 05:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
parents to try and weed out those
 
05:39:31.350 --> 05:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
nefarious characters and it would
 
05:39:32.948 --> 05:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
further support
 
05:39:32.958 --> 05:39:34.470 align:start position:0%
further support
conversations

05:39:34.470 --> 05:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
05:39:36.070 --> 05:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
it would further support
 
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
parents being held accountable and
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
responsible as much as educators should
 
05:39:43.990 --> 05:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
be held accountable responsible as much
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
as school board members budget committee
 
05:39:49.430 --> 05:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
members i have tried for over a year and
 
05:39:50.470 --> 05:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
a half
 
05:39:53.910 --> 05:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
to underst to act to request certain
 
05:39:55.910 --> 05:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
things we're not allowed in the school
 
05:39:55.920 --> 05:39:57.510 align:start position:0%
things we're not allowed in the school
library

05:39:57.510 --> 05:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
library
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
if you're a parent you're not allowed in
 
05:40:01.350 --> 05:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
the school library you can't even come
 
05:40:05.030 --> 05:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
in my school district
 
05:40:09.670 --> 05:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
and the argument is well parents don't
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
really have time or energy for that
 
05:40:11.120 --> 05:40:12.470 align:start position:0%
really have time or energy for that
anyways

05:40:12.470 --> 05:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
05:40:12.480 --> 05:40:13.350 align:start position:0%
anyways
so

05:40:13.350 --> 05:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:40:15.990 --> 05:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
educators can't have it both ways
 
05:40:18.070 --> 05:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
they can't have it both ways if they
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to be the babysitters then
 
05:40:21.990 --> 05:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
they need to start working
 
05:40:24.708 --> 05:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
collaboratively cooperatively and for
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
the whole child not just the student and
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
the parents need to be held accountable
 
05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
and responsible too
 
05:40:33.750 --> 05:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
and there is a mechanism
 
05:40:37.110 --> 05:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
there is a mechanism already in place
 
05:40:39.430 --> 05:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
if parents are not being
 
05:40:42.150 --> 05:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate there's a mechanism everyone
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
05:40:45.910 --> 05:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
is a mandated reporter so there's
 
05:40:48.470 --> 05:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
already a mechanism in place so this
 
05:40:48.480 --> 05:40:49.270 align:start position:0%
already a mechanism in place so this
bill

05:40:49.270 --> 05:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:40:51.990 --> 05:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
does not prevent
 
05:40:53.430 --> 05:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
children's rights
 
05:40:56.070 --> 05:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
if anything i would say it helps it
 
05:41:00.150 --> 05:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
helps improve
 
05:41:03.030 --> 05:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
children's rights parents rights
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
teachers rights
 
05:41:06.628 --> 05:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
school administration rights
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
and taxpayers rights
 
05:41:10.948 --> 05:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
05:41:10.958 --> 05:41:13.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
questions

05:41:13.830 --> 05:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:16.868 --> 05:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
05:41:18.868 --> 05:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question for
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
05:41:20.160 --> 05:41:21.830 align:start position:0%
taking the question
um

05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
when there is an issue with a teacher
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
and it is being addressed by the school
 
05:41:27.360 --> 05:41:28.310 align:start position:0%
and it is being addressed by the school
board

05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:41:28.320 --> 05:41:29.430 align:start position:0%
board
or

05:41:29.430 --> 05:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:41:31.830 --> 05:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
the administration all of those records
 
05:41:31.840 --> 05:41:33.350 align:start position:0%
the administration all of those records
are

05:41:33.350 --> 05:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:41:37.510 --> 05:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
are kept from the public and
 
05:41:40.230 --> 05:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
kept from the parents
 
05:41:40.240 --> 05:41:41.910 align:start position:0%
kept from the parents
so

05:41:41.910 --> 05:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:44.548 --> 05:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
my question to you is
 
05:41:47.430 --> 05:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
do you believe that
 
05:41:49.350 --> 05:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
in the example that you gave when there
 
05:41:49.360 --> 05:41:50.390 align:start position:0%
in the example that you gave when there
was

05:41:50.390 --> 05:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:41:51.750 --> 05:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
an obvious
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
issue going on in that classroom
 
05:41:54.240 --> 05:41:55.910 align:start position:0%
issue going on in that classroom
um

05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:57.750 --> 05:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
should the parents have been notified
 
05:42:01.990 --> 05:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
would allow them to be notified so that
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
they could
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
do this or do you have a suggestion for
 
05:42:09.590 --> 05:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
for solving that problem thank you very
 
05:42:09.600 --> 05:42:12.548 align:start position:0%
for solving that problem thank you very
much

05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:14.708 --> 05:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
i to this day
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
do not know
 
05:42:18.548 --> 05:42:18.558 align:start position:0%
exactly what went on in that classroom
 
05:42:20.548 --> 05:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
and what went on in the the other
 
05:42:23.590 --> 05:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
assignments before getting there i do
 
05:42:26.788 --> 05:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
know that a comment was made to me
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
after the teacher was brought up on
 
05:42:31.190 --> 05:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
criminal charges because i witnessed the
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
teacher i started going to that
 
05:42:34.470 --> 05:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
classroom every day
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
when my daughter was not allowed to move
 
05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
to a different classroom i went to that
 
05:42:41.910 --> 05:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
classroom every day
 
05:42:43.990 --> 05:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't see anything i was convinced my
 
05:42:46.070 --> 05:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
daughter was a drama queen
 
05:42:48.150 --> 05:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
one day my daughter was sick and i was
 
05:42:49.990 --> 05:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
so excited i didn't have to go to fifth
 
05:42:51.430 --> 05:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
grade today
 
05:42:53.350 --> 05:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
she came to me crying she's like you've
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
gotta be there you have no idea what
 
05:42:58.150 --> 05:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
she's gonna do to those kids if you're
 
05:42:59.590 --> 05:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
not there
 
05:43:01.030 --> 05:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
i went there
 
05:43:02.788 --> 05:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
i heard a commotion down at the end of
 
05:43:05.030 --> 05:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
the hallway and i noticed for the first
 
05:43:08.390 --> 05:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
time all the other classrooms were
 
05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
closed all their doors were closed and
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
as i got closer and closer to that
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
classroom i witnessed that teacher
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
physically slamming the locker the
 
05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
locker thing
 
05:43:22.310 --> 05:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
the locker door
 
05:43:25.510 --> 05:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
on this child's arm
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
there was a criminal complaint she was
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
found guilty but that was after two
 
05:43:30.400 --> 05:43:31.430 align:start position:0%
found guilty but that was after two
years

05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:43:34.470 --> 05:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
after two years of being shoved around
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
and that principle's comment so i didn't
 
05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
try to intervene i immediately walked
 
05:43:42.708 --> 05:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
down and and and this was before cell
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
phones even so i immediately
 
05:43:46.310 --> 05:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
well may not have been before cell

is the commissioner of education like
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
that is insane to me i have been
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
completely muted and it is
 
05:46:01.680 --> 05:46:03.030 align:start position:0%
completely muted and it is
disgraceful

05:46:03.030 --> 05:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
disgraceful
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
it is so upsetting to me and i am doing
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
whatever i can to be able to afford
 
05:46:10.470 --> 05:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
private school i already did tours i can
 
05:46:11.910 --> 05:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
go into the classroom i'm having
 
05:46:14.788 --> 05:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
conversations it's not right
 
05:46:18.230 --> 05:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
i feel like this bill would give parents
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be able to be a voice
 
05:46:23.110 --> 05:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
for their children
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
my kindergartener has anxiety he's
 
05:46:27.910 --> 05:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
counting down the days until he is out
 
05:46:28.948 --> 05:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
of school
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
he has developed anxiety he is sick he
 
05:46:34.390 --> 05:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
says he's sick every monday monday
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
tuesday wednesday thursday friday he
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
gets excited because he has gym he has
 
05:46:38.638 --> 05:46:39.590 align:start position:0%
gets excited because he has gym he has
pe

05:46:39.590 --> 05:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
pe
 
05:46:41.430 --> 05:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
so that's when he's excited to go to
 
05:46:43.510 --> 05:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
school and every day he wanted to come
 
05:46:46.628 --> 05:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
here with me today and he's like but he
 
05:46:48.708 --> 05:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
gets nervous he's developing anxiety he
 
05:46:51.190 --> 05:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
is the most amazing kid and
 
05:46:53.670 --> 05:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's so sad we've seen a complete change
 
05:46:55.750 --> 05:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
my husband is getting more involved he's
 
05:46:57.990 --> 05:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
understanding this which is awesome
 
05:46:59.750 --> 05:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
we've come together as a family because
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
of this but it is so sad that we have to
 
05:47:04.868 --> 05:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
create a bill of rights for parents to
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
get up here and speak
 
05:47:10.868 --> 05:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
i have chicken scratches everywhere i i
 
05:47:12.788 --> 05:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
want to be the advocate for my children
 
05:47:14.948 --> 05:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
i want to represent their voice
 
05:47:16.150 --> 05:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i will
 
05:47:18.548 --> 05:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
do whatever it takes to be that voice
 
05:47:19.910 --> 05:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
for them
 
05:47:21.990 --> 05:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
i want to give them the rights that they
 
05:47:24.470 --> 05:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
deserve through my guidance through my
 
05:47:26.708 --> 05:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
education in the best way that i know
 
05:47:29.110 --> 05:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
how the government does not know how to
 
05:47:31.350 --> 05:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
parent my children i don't trust them i
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
don't trust the schools and
 
05:47:35.910 --> 05:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we need to rise up and
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
protect these parents and in turn
 
05:47:43.110 --> 05:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
so i guess in closing
 
05:47:47.830 --> 05:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
i really hope that this bill will keep
 
05:47:50.470 --> 05:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
the honest people honest it will help
 
05:47:50.480 --> 05:47:52.310 align:start position:0%
the honest people honest it will help
give

05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
give
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
a reminder to the people that there are
 
05:47:56.788 --> 05:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
rules and laws about about what is
 
05:47:58.470 --> 05:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
natural and right
 
05:48:00.868 --> 05:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
it will keep families informed
 
05:48:03.110 --> 05:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
and involved and there should be nothing
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
to hide we also in newmarket cannot get
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
our curriculum
 
05:48:09.190 --> 05:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
what is up with that
 
05:48:10.868 --> 05:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
there's been multiple parents i'm
 
05:48:12.628 --> 05:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
speaking for all
 
05:48:14.390 --> 05:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
multiple parents here who have tried
 
05:48:17.030 --> 05:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
non-stop to get these curriculums why
 
05:48:19.430 --> 05:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
why are they being hidden from parents
 
05:48:20.868 --> 05:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
why am i going to pay taxes in new
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
market and now pay a private tuition
 
05:48:25.350 --> 05:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
i would so much rather do that than
 
05:48:26.948 --> 05:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
expose my children
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
to this type of environment it's it's
 
05:48:33.270 --> 05:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's so sad to me and we moved here
 
05:48:36.390 --> 05:48:36.400 align:start position:0%

05:48:37.750 --> 05:48:37.760 align:start position:0%

anxiety that i'm going to have to
 
05:49:58.230 --> 05:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
try to manage
 
05:50:00.708 --> 05:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
moving forward so
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
05:50:03.990 --> 05:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:07.830 --> 05:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:10.868 --> 05:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
representative yokela
 
05:50:12.470 --> 05:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:19.270 --> 05:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
if you had the ability to see the
 
05:50:21.430 --> 05:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum and
 
05:50:24.628 --> 05:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
go into the classroom if there was an
 
05:50:24.638 --> 05:50:25.750 align:start position:0%
go into the classroom if there was an
issue

05:50:25.750 --> 05:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:50:28.150 --> 05:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
would you
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
feel that you did not need to leave that
 
05:50:33.270 --> 05:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
um public school
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
because there was something that you
 
05:50:37.830 --> 05:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
that you had um
 
05:50:39.910 --> 05:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh control over and so that you could
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
observe that
 
05:50:44.150 --> 05:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
your child is is doing well in that
 
05:50:44.160 --> 05:50:45.270 align:start position:0%
your child is is doing well in that
school

05:50:45.270 --> 05:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:50:47.110 --> 05:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
i yeah i think the biggest issue right
 
05:50:49.270 --> 05:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
now is there's no transparency i don't
 
05:50:49.280 --> 05:50:50.310 align:start position:0%
now is there's no transparency i don't
trust

05:50:50.310 --> 05:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
trust
 
05:50:50.320 --> 05:50:51.430 align:start position:0%
trust
anybody

05:50:51.430 --> 05:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
05:50:53.030 --> 05:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
they have given me no reason to trust
 
05:50:54.310 --> 05:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
them if there was something that i
 
05:50:56.868 --> 05:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with i would opt out i'm
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
currently opting out of a lot of things
 
05:51:00.948 --> 05:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
already if they're showing videos on how
 
05:51:03.110 --> 05:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
to wear a mask properly they're showing
 
05:51:05.350 --> 05:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
videos on covid i just don't think that
 
05:51:06.868 --> 05:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
is part of that should be part of the
 
05:51:06.878 --> 05:51:08.150 align:start position:0%
is part of that should be part of the
curriculum

05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
05:51:10.708 --> 05:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
why why are they talking about that so
 
05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
and they're still allowing it i have
 
05:51:15.510 --> 05:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
specified very clearly of what my kids
 
05:51:17.990 --> 05:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
are to opt out of if they decide to
 
05:51:19.510 --> 05:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
share the information
 
05:51:22.230 --> 05:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
copiod talks vaccinations all that stuff
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
being one of them and they're still
 
05:51:25.030 --> 05:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
under my consent and they were just like
 
05:51:28.788 --> 05:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
oh it's just a little i'm like no i
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
specifically said this and so my right
 
05:51:33.110 --> 05:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's like they don't care
 
05:51:35.430 --> 05:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
so if this were to be implemented and
 
05:51:37.750 --> 05:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
going a lot and that was to be followed
 
05:51:40.470 --> 05:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
i would absolutely i'd be like yep no my
 
05:51:41.990 --> 05:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
kid can either
 
05:51:44.708 --> 05:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
step out during that time
 
05:51:46.548 --> 05:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
not be a part of it i just think there
 
05:51:48.230 --> 05:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be transparency there needs to
 
05:51:49.590 --> 05:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
be some understanding i don't want
 
05:51:51.510 --> 05:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
secret i don't want a barrier put
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
between my kid and the school i want i
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
want them to be able to trust adults
 
05:51:56.948 --> 05:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
trust educators
 
05:51:59.350 --> 05:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
so yeah i think that would be
 
05:52:00.868 --> 05:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
a totally different thing if there was
 
05:52:02.470 --> 05:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
transparency like that among parents
 
05:52:05.510 --> 05:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
there would be so much more trust
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
so much more
 
05:52:06.840 --> 05:52:08.390 align:start position:0%
so much more
trust

05:52:08.390 --> 05:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
trust
 
05:52:09.830 --> 05:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:13.670 --> 05:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:14.788 --> 05:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
05:52:17.030 --> 05:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
much thank you

to speak in support of the bill for four
 
05:52:25.600 --> 05:52:29.030 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the bill for four
minutes

05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%

brookline high school
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
starting in august i requested a
 
05:52:58.230 --> 05:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
complete list of curriculum
 
05:53:00.548 --> 05:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
including textbooks movies and reading
 
05:53:00.558 --> 05:53:01.910 align:start position:0%
including textbooks movies and reading
assignments

05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
assignments
 
05:53:04.470 --> 05:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
i was denied multiple times and told
 
05:53:06.070 --> 05:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
that i could log into my children's
 
05:53:08.788 --> 05:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
google classroom to see what resources
 
05:53:10.868 --> 05:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
the teachers were using
 
05:53:12.788 --> 05:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
on several occasions my children came
 
05:53:15.910 --> 05:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
home with questionable material reeled a
 
05:53:18.310 --> 05:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
riddled with inappropriate sexual
 
05:53:21.030 --> 05:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
content divisive concepts
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
and reading books with a lexicon level
 
05:53:25.990 --> 05:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
of a fourth or fifth grader
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
in some cases they were only allowed to
 
05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
go to one resource
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
assigned by the teacher to do their
 
05:53:33.120 --> 05:53:34.708 align:start position:0%
assigned by the teacher to do their
research

05:53:34.708 --> 05:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
research
 
05:53:36.948 --> 05:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
our res the resources used were very
 
05:53:36.958 --> 05:53:38.070 align:start position:0%
our res the resources used were very
biased

05:53:38.070 --> 05:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
biased
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
this practice is something the growth of
 
05:53:42.470 --> 05:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
our children to be critical thinkers
 
05:53:44.230 --> 05:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
when my daughter attempted to add a
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
direct quote to an assignment and give
 
05:53:48.628 --> 05:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
her interpretation of the quote she was
 
05:53:50.150 --> 05:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
told that her project seemed
 
05:53:50.160 --> 05:53:51.910 align:start position:0%
told that her project seemed
argumentative

05:53:51.910 --> 05:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
argumentative
 
05:53:53.350 --> 05:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
and that she needed to redo the
 
05:53:53.360 --> 05:53:54.868 align:start position:0%
and that she needed to redo the
incitement

05:53:54.868 --> 05:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
incitement
 
05:53:59.350 --> 05:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:01.350 --> 05:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
i would look on their google classrooms
 
05:54:03.910 --> 05:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
and could not find the resources
 
05:54:05.990 --> 05:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
my children told me about
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
there was absolutely no transparency
 
05:54:10.868 --> 05:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
i wanted to be able to have a clear
 
05:54:12.788 --> 05:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
picture of what was going on in the
 
05:54:16.708 --> 05:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
schools so i completed the six hours
 
05:54:18.708 --> 05:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
of volunteer training
 
05:54:21.190 --> 05:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
when i completed all of my requirements
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
training background check and
 
05:54:25.670 --> 05:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting to my surprise i was
 
05:54:28.150 --> 05:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
denied the opportunity to volunteer
 
05:54:29.510 --> 05:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
through the school
 
05:54:31.350 --> 05:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
the principal told me that the school
 
05:54:33.750 --> 05:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't offer them even though they were
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
short pairs and teachers at the time
 
05:54:39.110 --> 05:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
i would need to find opportunities
 
05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
through the parent student teacher
 
05:54:43.830 --> 05:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
association i then requested to observe
 
05:54:48.150 --> 05:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
a class citing essa 1116c
 
05:54:49.910 --> 05:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
parental engagement
 
05:54:52.150 --> 05:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
i was denied by the superintendent and
 
05:54:53.430 --> 05:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
the principal
 
05:54:55.350 --> 05:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
they said it was denied based on the
 
05:54:57.270 --> 05:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements and
 
05:54:59.350 --> 05:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
student privacy
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
in our district i could put in an
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
application to substitute teach without
 
05:55:06.548 --> 05:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
a teaching degree
 
05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
and be running my own class
 
05:55:12.150 --> 05:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
after questioning the things i was
 
05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
seeing the administration informed me
 
05:55:16.868 --> 05:55:16.878 align:start position:0%
that i was not allowed to meet with a
 
05:55:19.350 --> 05:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
teacher or question them about any
 
05:55:22.150 --> 05:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum and all questions should go
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the administration
 
05:55:26.470 --> 05:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
it became very clear to me they didn't
 
05:55:30.230 --> 05:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
want me anywhere near the school
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
the hyper focus on sexuality divisive
 
05:55:35.830 --> 05:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
concepts and the constant focus on their
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
social and emotional learning is
 
05:55:40.868 --> 05:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
planting seeds in these developing minds
 
05:55:43.350 --> 05:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
it is destructive for our children and
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
as a parent
 
05:55:47.270 --> 05:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
i should have had the opportunity to
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
voice my her my concerns and have been
 
05:55:50.160 --> 05:55:51.270 align:start position:0%
voice my her my concerns and have been
heard

05:55:51.270 --> 05:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:55:54.390 --> 05:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
after working tirelessly for six months
 
05:55:56.948 --> 05:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
i came to the conclusion i had no other
 
05:55:59.350 --> 05:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
option than to remove my children from
 
05:56:02.150 --> 05:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
the public school education until things
 
05:56:02.160 --> 05:56:05.190 align:start position:0%
the public school education until things
changed

05:56:05.190 --> 05:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:07.830 --> 05:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
i have seen a complete shift in our
 
05:56:09.910 --> 05:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
educational system in the last couple of
 
05:56:09.920 --> 05:56:11.270 align:start position:0%
educational system in the last couple of
decades

05:56:11.270 --> 05:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
decades
 
05:56:13.910 --> 05:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
and as a parent it's frightening
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is so crucial to me because it
 
05:56:18.628 --> 05:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
defines the parental rights in our
 
05:56:20.548 --> 05:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
children's education
 
05:56:22.150 --> 05:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that some
 
05:56:24.628 --> 05:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
administration have forgotten that the
 
05:56:27.110 --> 05:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
children belong to the parents and not
 
05:56:29.590 --> 05:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
to the public education system
 
05:56:32.070 --> 05:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
the job of parents is to direct the
 
05:56:33.830 --> 05:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
upbringing of our children in their
 
05:56:35.990 --> 05:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
moral and religious training
 
05:56:39.510 --> 05:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
education health care mental health and
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
unconditionally love them
 
05:56:46.548 --> 05:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you that in section 169
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
i three you strike the line in the
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
section that states without
 
05:56:53.270 --> 05:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that such action is
 
05:56:55.990 --> 05:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable and necessary to achieve a
 
05:56:59.510 --> 05:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
compelling state interest and that the
 
05:57:02.390 --> 05:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
such action is narrowly tailored and is
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
not otherwise served by a less
 
05:57:06.070 --> 05:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
restrictive means
 
05:57:08.390 --> 05:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
every parent has been blessed by god
 
05:57:10.628 --> 05:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
with our precious babies and we know
 
05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
what's best for them they belong to the
 
05:57:14.948 --> 05:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
parents not to the state or the
 
05:57:18.788 --> 05:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
government please opt to pass 1431 and
 
05:57:20.628 --> 05:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
give rights back to the parents so we
 
05:57:22.868 --> 05:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
can protect them and raise them in the
 
05:57:24.390 --> 05:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
ways they should go
 
05:57:25.910 --> 05:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:31.270 --> 05:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:36.150 --> 05:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:39.190 --> 05:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay this is the last pink card so this
 
05:57:43.510 --> 05:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
will be it for the day
 
05:57:43.520 --> 05:57:46.230 align:start position:0%
will be it for the day
a

05:57:46.230 --> 05:57:46.240 align:start position:0%

two minutes
 
05:57:57.190 --> 05:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody it's it's quite late
 
05:57:59.350 --> 05:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
but you know i look around the room and
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm amazed by
 
05:58:04.390 --> 05:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
the wisdom not just on the walls but
 
05:58:06.948 --> 05:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
with all of you all of you
 
05:58:08.708 --> 05:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
this is a very difficult decision for
 
05:58:08.718 --> 05:58:09.750 align:start position:0%
this is a very difficult decision for
everybody

05:58:09.750 --> 05:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
05:58:12.230 --> 05:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
but there's some this one uniting thing
 
05:58:14.310 --> 05:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
and everything you've heard today and it
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what side of the aisle
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
you are from
 
05:58:19.510 --> 05:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's about trust it really is
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
and trust is like it's a soap bubble
 
05:58:24.070 --> 05:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
right once we lose it it's so hard to
 
05:58:25.510 --> 05:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
get it back
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%

06:02:40.390 --> 06:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:40.400 --> 06:02:53.350 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:02:53.350 --> 06:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:15.430 --> 06:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:38.628 --> 06:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:38.638 --> 06:04:10.708 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:04:10.708 --> 06:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:10.718 --> 06:04:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:04:18.230 --> 06:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:42.788 --> 06:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:42.798 --> 06:05:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:05:11.040 --> 06:05:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:05:12.470 --> 06:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:05:14.628 --> 06:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
exactly that's why
 
06:05:29.590 --> 06:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:47.230 --> 06:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:02.310 --> 06:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:12.230 --> 06:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:12.240 --> 06:06:48.868 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:06:48.868 --> 06:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:48.878 --> 06:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:06:55.430 --> 06:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:55.440 --> 06:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:08:15.990 --> 06:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
because that's because that's because he
 
06:08:17.430 --> 06:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't represent
 
06:08:34.470 --> 06:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:45.670 --> 06:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:45.680 --> 06:09:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:24.548 --> 06:09:24.558 align:start position:0%
is that every um
 
06:09:26.310 --> 06:09:26.320 align:start position:0%

06:09:28.230 --> 06:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
has to do with students
 
06:09:29.350 --> 06:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
they also
 
06:09:29.360 --> 06:09:30.470 align:start position:0%
they also
schedule

06:09:30.470 --> 06:09:30.480 align:start position:0%

06:09:59.360 --> 06:10:19.110 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:10:19.110 --> 06:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:21.910 --> 06:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
