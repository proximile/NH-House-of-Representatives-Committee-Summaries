quorum

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
we will go through these bills uh as
 
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
best we can here
 
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
starting out with house bill 39.
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
and house bill 39. you are you do you
 
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
okay House Bill 39 representative Cole
 
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
second by representative hunt moves in
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
and representative Cole is recognized to
 
00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
speak to his notion
 
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh the committee voted unanimously eight
 
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah we we usually have another
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
sentence that that uh uh because you're
 
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
going to have to write a blurb you have
 
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
to write excuse me report
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
excuse me we have to write a committee
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
report so you want to practice what
 
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
you're going to say in the committee
 
00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
report as to why the committee uh the
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee decided that was an exceed
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
so uh um obviously writing blurbs is
 
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
going to be a whole new art form for you
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
new members to learn and uh I will
 
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
certainly help you out the rule general
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
rule of thumb when you write a blurb is
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
you write what the bills list intended
 
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
and then you write if there was an
 
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
amendment what the amendment does if
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
there's no Amendment then you would say
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
after you wrote what the bill was
 
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
intended to do you would then say uh
 
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
however the committee felt that the
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
problem with a bill would XYZ now when
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
you write your blurb the one of the
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
tricks that I have is if you take the
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
the bill does someone have the bill in
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
okay so if you take the bill in front of
 
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
okay so if you take the bill in front of
you

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
and then when you see that it says
 
00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.749 align:start position:0%
and then when you see that it says
analysis

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
cut and paste that
 
00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
okay that's what the bill does this bill
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
makes changes you know and blah blah
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
this is UCC that's not that bill
 
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
okay so the bill oh this is even better
 
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
it's like two sentences okay the bill
 
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
prohibits a person from doing business
 
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
in the state from charging an additional
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
fee for receiving a paper billing
 
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
statement elected to make a payment by
 
00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 align:start position:0%
the United States mail or attempting to
 
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
pay a bill in person the committee felt
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
this was unworkable unenforceable
 
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
and and not really appropriate in just
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
say problematic
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
or or you can research what I wrote last
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
question or you can research what I
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
wrote last year and steal it just yeah
 
00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 align:start position:0%
right because it was the same bill
 
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
that's another another trick okay
 
00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
okay so I I uh yeah okay or I can send
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
it to you the motion uh is being to
 
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
legislate the clerk will call the roll
 
00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.390 align:start position:0%
legislate the clerk will call the roll
right

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
this is the wrong committee hang on
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%

00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:23.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:32.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
all right so the subcommittee knew that
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
we had these two amendments and um did
 
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
not know that uh we could get it done so
 
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.329 align:start position:0%
not know that uh we could get it done so
quickly

00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
um so who would like to make them I'll
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
just make the motion is that well
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
somebody else wants to do it
 
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.530 align:start position:0%
somebody else wants to do it
anybody

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay you can be you can teach us okay
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
all right so um I I move uh uh ought to
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't bother with the H because
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
that means the house and it's only
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
amendment we we wouldn't be voting on
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
so because there's an amendment number
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
you write the amendment there so the
 
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
against it no I am what my motion is
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.069 align:start position:0%
 
okay

okay
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
and uh second RIP by representative
 
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.730 align:start position:0%
and uh second RIP by representative
petusic

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
petusic
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
okay so what this amendment does it
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
brings in the two concerns that people
 
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.490 align:start position:0%
brings in the two concerns that people
had

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:19.019 align:start position:0%
um in particular in these it's Roman
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
numeral two it's actually in one and two
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
that it has to be
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
um the the homeowners association had to
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
have been created by the planning board
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
actually it's not in one it's just in
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
two no Homer Association constant of
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
this chapter and approved by the
 
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
planning board so that's the one
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment the second amendment was uh to
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
take out time shares not that I could
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
imagine that any timeshare has a
 
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
homeowners association but
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
anything can happen
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
so those are the two amendments
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
so the motion is ought to pass on the
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%

consent Calendar please say aye
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh relative to repair of Home Appliances
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.949 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay the recommendation is to retain it
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
because remember said I feel it wanted
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
us to retain it and he's not here okay
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
so we just wait till he gets here
 
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
because he's the one who wanted to
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
retain yeah
 
00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:13.970 align:start position:0%
retain yeah
okay

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
that's all right well all right so the
 
00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:19.339 align:start position:0%
next one is uh house bill
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
173. I don't even remember talking did
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
we talk about this oh that's right
 
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.449 align:start position:0%
we talk about this oh that's right
um

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:26.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.459 align:start position:0%
okay so 173 we need to we need an
 
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
amendment to repeal the whole building
 
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.470 align:start position:0%
amendment to repeal the whole building
code

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to retain it yes oh that's
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
right because we have to wait till after
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
they have done Implement right the
 
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
building code is implemented okay all
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
right so who would like to make the
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:52.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
segment representative patusek
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
moves to retain yep
 
00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:04.610 align:start position:0%
moves to retain yep
173.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.810 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your motion I can
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
speak briefly uh so we heard testimony
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
that the state building codes are going
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
to be updated at some future point which
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
will make the entire RSA Obsolete and so
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
changing the RSA uh would be meaningless
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
at that point so the idea is to hold on
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
to the bill and hopefully those codes
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
will be updated by next session
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh next year and we can uh amend the
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
bill to make it more appropriate
 
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.810 align:start position:0%
bill to make it more appropriate
okay

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:44.540 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion to retain
 
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh I guess I have to roll
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
call this you know
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
in the old days it used to be the chair
 
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
just has the sense I loved it that I
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
could just unilaterally call it retained
 
00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.990 align:start position:0%
could just unilaterally call it retained
so

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
oh you have to call
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
you I thought you said you had to do
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
this no no no no no we so Mr chairman on
 
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
a retain you don't have the opportunity
 
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
to say without objection so ordered I
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
wish I did I used to then I used to by
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
rule you can't do that anymore not
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
anymore now we have to roll call
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
everything we have to have a roll call
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.169 --> 00:17:26.179 align:start position:0%
and this is not Washington
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
all right then
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
um this is on retaining HB 173 correct
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%

to speak to his motion
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh we heard testimony that the reason
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
that exemptions exist for certain
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
categories of Industry
 
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
is because
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
those Industries are highly regulated
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
and uh having an exemption for uh
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
personal right to action would have
 
00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences with existing
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
regulation and uh even though the bills
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
is well intentioned it would cause uh
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh some a little bit of chaos with
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
existing regulations so therefore move
 
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.190 align:start position:0%
existing regulations so therefore move

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
believe the Liquor Commission should be
 
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.299 align:start position:0%

00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure Chagrin I I we didn't
 
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
you know belabor it they were going to
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
do a little more homework on it so this
 
00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
morning uh for better for worse I have
 
00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
to it takes me an hour and a half to
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
hour 15 minutes to drive in
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
um which I wouldn't have when we were in
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
the old days when I used to be zooming I
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to to contemplate my
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
navel but in this case I I called up the
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
commission I said
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and I had all the enforcement in the
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
room and I said so normally in a way
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
when we I know the history of how this
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
happened you know in terms of what we
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
were trying to do we were worried that
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
Nano somebody would try to open up a
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
nano in their in their living room and
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
then I said uh to them so normally if we
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
understand that there's this federal law
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
that requires that you've you know you
 
00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
can't have in it in a residential
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
environment and that you can't it did no
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
residents should impede the way the
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
federal law has been impede your ability
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
to uh to enter the facility
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
um normally I would say is okay since
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
this is a statue that should really
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
apply not just a nano it should apply to
 
00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:56.090 align:start position:0%
apply not just a nano it should apply to
everybody

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
all you know beverage manufacturers but
 
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
I don't and that I'm not too excited
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
about passing I said so if it's already
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
federal statute why don't we just pass
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
this bill as is and repeal
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
the the the business requirement the
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
residential requirement specially since
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
it seems to have got the commissioner
 
00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:21.380 align:start position:0%
the Commission in their enforcement
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
befuddled over the fact that they were
 
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
seen to be taking it a little farther
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
than what the actual legislative intent
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
was and their response was quickly is a
 
00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
great idea let's just pass it
 
00:33:33.659 --> 00:33:34.970 align:start position:0%
great idea let's just pass it
so

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative hunt seconded by
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative patusex booze
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass question House Bill 160
 
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
is now open for discussion thank you
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert I'm just trying
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
to uh if I recall
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
um you you said that what this gentleman
 
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
actually wants is to be able to go on
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall and tap in
 
00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:06.299 align:start position:0%
other words serve in in his
 
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
establishment and that was his goal his
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
his problem was that he had he had
 
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
complied with the federal law yeah that
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
ensured that you could not get from the
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
residence right into the facility which
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
was a a barn attached to his house right
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
and so therefore he was in compliance
 
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
with the federal law but even more
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
importantly he was in compliance with
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
of what the statute that was written
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
that we intended when we put it in okay
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
because we didn't we don't want liquor
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
enforcement to have to walk through any
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
residential any part of somebody's house
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
to get to the Nano you know the Nano
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
facility so given that he was in
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
compliance and that theoretically he was
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
going to be given permission to be in
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
compliant as soon as the commission you
 
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
know was able to get up and check out
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
his facility but what was scary was was
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
turns out that he wasn't the only one
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
that had this problem that there were
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
others that had the problem so even the
 
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
commission admitted that um the the law
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
that we had the current law now is
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
flawed and so the better part of valor
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
is just let's just get rid of it we
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about the
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
legislative intent because that is
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
federal law now
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
um further further
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
um so these other instances that came to
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
the fore or right circled up those folks
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
all got the federal license they did
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
okay and and they got their license and
 
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
and they all had to pay the higher fee
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
to become uh beverage manufacturers when
 
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
they were actually their production
 
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
levels were very low so they really
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
comply to be Nanos
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
so this guy's gonna have to still pay
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
the uh well he's already paid the fee
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
but when his renewal which will come up
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
in June yeah he will be able to uh
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
reapply as a nano
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
it would renew his license as a nano
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
rather than him and the Liquor
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
Commission is
 
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
kosher they think that's a good idea all
 
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
kosher they think that's a good idea all
right

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes I believe uh
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
that when we discussed this it was
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
revealed that the federal requirement
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
had been satisfied because the uh
 
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
because the door had been padlocked
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
correct and the state was interpreting
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
the statute in such a way as to suggest
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
that even though it was padlocked
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
um that would that was not sufficient
 
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
correct so if we eliminate this we are
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledging what the feds are
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledging and that it that is that a
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
padlock is sufficient and it can
 
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
continue to be a nano and pay the Nano
 
00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
fee rather than the higher fee
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
therefore I'm in support of it thank you
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
there you go all right any more
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%

good Tony zip all those in favor placing
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
on the consent Calendar please say aye
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
those opposed so moved unanimously
 
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:14.329 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.710 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:34.220 align:start position:0%
it's a it really requires the work
 
00:38:36.849 --> 00:38:36.859 align:start position:0%
279 yeah
 
00:38:36.859 --> 00:38:38.510 align:start position:0%
279 yeah
okay

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
um 279 is being passed around
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so uh sometimes when we get an
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment will only be
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
just uh that you would have to keep the
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
the bill itself in front of you and then
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
you have to look at the amendment and
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
kind of uh fold it in in this case they
 
00:38:59.930 --> 00:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
just rewrote the whole thing so it
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
replaces it so replace it said so you
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
can see that this is It's always helpful
 
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
so you look at line one it says amend
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
the bill by replacing all after the
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
enacting Clause that's magic word saying
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
is this is the whole bill in uh all
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
together rather than just the amendment
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
so what the the uh critical change in
 
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
um was uh in lines uh it started 11 to
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
14 where uh in the original uh the bill
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
um but then we're saying if there is
 
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
document attendance by the licensees
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
Personnel at a commission sponsored by
 
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
educational program before the injury or
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
death either online or in person the
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.270 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's not what I wanted I didn't think
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
so okay never mind this is wrong this
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
was the wrong one
 
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no it was supposed to it was
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
supposed to be 10 days and then
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
automatic 30 days but I want to say this
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
is the way the commission uh the
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
commission I sent them the wrong file
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
sorry never mind we won't take this up
 
00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:29.630 align:start position:0%
sorry never mind we won't take this up
today

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
well it was it was sort of the chicken
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
the egg how do we how do we do this I my
 
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
intent was to be my intent was to be uh
 
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
that it's we maintain the 10 days which
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
is the current law but that uh if there
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
was if they had not gone through the
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
training it would have been 30 days
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.130 align:start position:0%
what's up
um

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:54.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
that was that's my fault I sent it I
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
sent the wrong file okay Mr chairman yes
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
I have a question yes
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you uh line four uh new paragraphs
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
serving intoxicated persons penalties in
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
case of serious bodily injury or death
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
so it's it's really only saying
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
that it's it's okay to serve somebody
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
overserve somebody as long as they don't
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
after the fact commit a crime isn't it
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
illegal to over serve somebody period
 
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
yeah what this section is about is what
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
are the penalties that the Liquor
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
Commission has to enforce so if you look
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know so you see that this is the the
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
and then you have the second offense
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
this is a mess
 
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.550 align:start position:0%
this is a mess
yeah

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it read that it's illegal to
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
to over serve anyway that's somewhere
 
00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.810 align:start position:0%
to over serve anyway that's somewhere
else

00:41:59.810 --> 00:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's that's somewhere else in the
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
section all right well this what we're
 
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:07.140 align:start position:0%
well we're amending here is just the
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
penalty what the instructions to the the
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
judge who happens to be the Liquor
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
Commission that what their what the
 
00:42:19.569 --> 00:42:19.579 align:start position:0%
penalties of overserving if someone
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
and if somebody gets hurt or dies so Mr
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
chairman if I understand this correctly
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to the 30 consecutive
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
days and the 7 500 in the situation with
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
it it uh it could very it could very
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
well then be 30 days in a fine of 7 500
 
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
resulting because
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
because they did not have the bartender
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
or whoever did not have the required
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
training correct so there's no
 
00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
additional penalty for not having the
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
required training this is the maximum
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
penalty if there's no required if
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's no but under the current law
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
right now it does it just simply says 10
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
days right so this is 30 days now this
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
would be 30 days suspension it's 30 days
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
if there's no training oh correct
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
up to up to 30 days to 30 days that's
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
their discretion right okay thank you
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman yes a point of
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
clarification yes representative Terry
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
referred to required training is it am I
 
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
wrong but there is no required training
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
that is correct that's right that is
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
another issue that is the issue that the
 
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
issue that's been from this committee
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
multiple times was the Mandate training
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
right and and that always seemed to this
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
committee problematic right because
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
employees come and go right uh
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately right now even more so
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
right yeah most ever before the
 
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
suggested training
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't want it to sound like we
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
had yeah no that was good clarification
 
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay moving right on let's go to now 531
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
relative to the taxation of tobacco and
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
you did
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
okay representative below second by
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
records and Vincent
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
and representative below is recognized
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
to speak to her motion
 
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this um Bill increases the
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
taxes on nicotine products
 
00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
um and I did receive some phone calls
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
from constituents who own
 
00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:44.510 align:start position:0%
from constituents who own
um

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
smoking stores or like a Smoker's Haven
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
and um he explained that it really would
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
not uh really be any increase in revenue
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
for the state because uh many people
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
that are coming over the Border you know
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
border towns are buying the cigarettes
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
knowing that they're cheaper
 
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
um if they weren't cheaper than let's
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
say Massachusetts then they would buy
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
them in Massachusetts so we would lose
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh and not only that the
 
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
businesses that we want to
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
um assist in making money uh whether
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
they be you know smoke shops or not
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
um we really should be working uh in the
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
best interest for our business Community
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
as well so I think the increase in taxes
 
00:45:29.579 --> 00:45:30.890 align:start position:0%
as well so I think the increase in taxes
is

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
is not a good thing for the state
 
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
okay representative Burroughs
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I think there were
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
more people who were in agreement with
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
me who who
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
um were I say six to one I know but I
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
think two people am I correct may be
 
00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:51.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is the first I've heard that I
 
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.430 align:start position:0%
this is the first I've heard that I
remember

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
um argument yeah like when did we talk
 
00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099 align:start position:0%
about that on this before no what she
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
just said like yeah
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
during the hearing as well not not
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
executive session I mean not the um
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee subcommittee we heard it um
 
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
the day we heard the bill from the
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor yeah
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
so they were the community business
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
owners came in and uh they were not for
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
this uh increase in you know taxes
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
because they said that they would lose
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
revenue and the state would lose Revenue
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
I would I would just say that
 
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.230 align:start position:0%
I would I would just say that
um

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:29.089 --> 00:46:29.099 align:start position:0%
I never allowed to see a business lose
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
money but in this case I think there's a
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
Public Health crisis around cigarettes
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
and frankly anything in my mind that
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
would would help people stop smoking
 
00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs I support uh what
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs just said I
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
think this representative spear thank
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
you uh I accidentally voted the wrong
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
way last time so I'm one of those crazy
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
people but nonetheless yes we might lose
 
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
some Revenue
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh and and it's not going to be very
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
much but we're going to spend money on
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
health care as a result of these people
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
getting continuing with this smoking
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
thing not to say listen so I don't know
 
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
this what not if they live in
 
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.010 align:start position:0%
this what not if they live in
Massachusetts

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
then at the federal level my medicare is
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
going to get hit
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think that there's any
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
kind of a loss
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think that I think we're
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
going to pay we may lose on this side
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
but we're going to gain on that side so
 
00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
I the fact that a few tobacco outfits
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
are going to lose a little money May
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
save us all in the long run so just just
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure you're this is the liquor
 
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
committee and know you are not on the
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
liquor committee
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
that so that's six to one

10 11 12 13 14 15 2 5.
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay 15 to 5. so that will stay on the
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
regular calendar would there be a
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
yes and representative Burroughs you
 
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
will be doing The Minority Report
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay uh two more uh 612 relative to the
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
fees for New Hampshire wine
 
00:49:53.339 --> 00:50:00.710 align:start position:0%
fees for New Hampshire wine
manufacturers

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
no we itl but you you it yelled it
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
I think was uh no on this yeah so just
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
to jog your memory okay is that we turns
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
out we do have a hundred dollar p p to
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
be a de minimis wine manufacturer
 
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
that uh we're not we don't see any
 
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
particular reason to change the sample
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
size from five ounce to six ounce
 
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
and then the third part which was to re
 
00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:42.740 align:start position:0%
to repeal the wine tax the excise tax
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
for when a wine is not delivered through
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
the commission but is delivered directly
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
um uh it's self-delivered if we want to
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
call it that self-delivered or sold on
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
site that we would leave the tax at the
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
five percent
 
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
excise tax
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
so the motion represented below second
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
by representative Sullivan moves in
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and that's the
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason why you just said
 
00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.430 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason why you just said
it

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on the motion of it
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
out yes representative I had a chance to
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
talk to Mike Apollo after yesterday and
 
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh you want to pull the mic a little
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
closer I had a chance to talk to Mike
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
Apollo yesterday and um I represent two
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
wine uh independent wine
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
um companies in my district
 
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
um I think there is some Merit to their
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
complaints about the taxation issues I
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
think we might want to consider working
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
part alone I don't I agree that it is
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
itl for the other elements of it but I
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
think that we should not just throw that
 
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.309 align:start position:0%
think that we should not just throw that
away

00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:51.380 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that the five percent
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
is too high I do
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
I feel that they are being penalized and
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
the size of their operations are are
 
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
being thwarted these independent
 
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
Vineyards there are not a lot of them
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
but this is really
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
um unfair taxation compared to other
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
Industries as compared to the Beer the
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
30 cents a gallon beer tax but of course
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
in beer that that the tax you know is at
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
the uh wholesale rate and and so there's
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
a margin there right and and obviously
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
the wine this is uh an ability uh the
 
00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:30.980 align:start position:0%
five percent was created
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
when we gave them the right to sell the
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
wine themselves because the law was
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
prior to that was they the only way you
 
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
could buy a bottle of wine in New
 
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.069 align:start position:0%
could buy a bottle of wine in New
Hampshire

00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
was through the Liquor Commission right
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
which The Liquor Commission then got its
 
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
much greater than five percent it got
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
its 25 margin so we were taking the
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
state was taking a hit to allow them to
 
00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:02.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
trying to think about it
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes representative solo sir
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
I remember yesterday during the
 
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
discussion wasn't there a concern about
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
this being unconstitutional like having
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
different prices well I brought that up
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
if we were to try to do something
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
different in other words if we were to
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
say is that only the um only the large
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
wine guys
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay gals would be uh at the five
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
percent and that we would do something
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
Less in other words have a a lower
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
excess tax but the reality is that five
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
percent was already you know a steep
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
discount from what uh you know in terms
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
of selling it through the Liquor
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
Commission so so you're this is the in
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
lieu of the Liquor Commission you they
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
want to sell it straight so they don't
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
have to sell to the commission so the
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
theory is that that five percent
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
um is is a it is actually retail I think
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
so it in terms of what they end up
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
selling it for but they can obviously
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
sell it in a much higher price
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
factor in the five percent then when if
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
what they would sell it to the
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's still lower than room
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
right now they would have to pay the
 
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
rooms for meals if they opened the
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
bottle and gave them a sample and
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
charged them
 
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
for the sample but if they gave it to
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
them for free like they used to do in
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
the old days then there would be no
 
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
rooms and meal Stacks there's still
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
there's no rooms and meals tax if you
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
but if you're if you're uh I mean it in
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
terms of a lot of these when I mean
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
let's say that's what Nano was all about
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
was was that they really they were like
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
a wine bar I mean you'd come in and you
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
know you got all these different samples
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
I know there's some when you're supposed
 
00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
to do wine tasting California so you're
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to spit it out you're
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
not supposed to drink it you're just
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
supposed to Let's swirl it around a
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
little bit but the reality is people are
 
00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:09.059 align:start position:0%
drinking it yes representative Gibbs
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to retain this bill
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh so as to be able to strip out
 
00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:20.339 align:start position:0%
anything relating to samples and
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
um make sure that we were bringing
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
forward only something that would be a
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
tax or a fee honestly I don't care what
 
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
you call it
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
um that would be both constitutional and
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
fair as between wine and beer
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing right well I was I'm
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
trying to emphasize that there is a
 
00:55:40.569 --> 00:55:40.579 align:start position:0%
difference between beer and wine okay
 
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
and and that was that
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
um the concept that
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
the prophets of the of those wines right
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
now uh the one who's really making out
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
is the Liquor Commission
 
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
if you buy it through the Liquor
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
Commission but they came in and asked
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
for legislation to allow them to sell it
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
there on the farm or on in a farmer's
 
00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.890 align:start position:0%
there on the farm or on in a farmer's
market

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's also okay so everyone says well
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's great uh but but how now but the
 
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is now losing out on
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
all the profit now we don't get anything
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
and the political compromise at that
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
time and no one seemed to have a problem
 
00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:27.059 align:start position:0%
with it was the five percent
 
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
because it seemed like a very low number
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
in the scheme of things that at least
 
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
the state you know the that the
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
commission might not be making its money
 
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
on selling the wine but we're giving the
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
privilege to allow these uh wineries to
 
00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
actually sell it themselves or go to
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
farmers markets and do all those
 
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
different things and all we're asking is
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
for our five percent cut so is the
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
difference between beer and wine the
 
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
fact that the Liquor Commission never
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
sold the beer anyway that is correct
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you so so in our
 
00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
for better for worse our forefathers
 
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
thought it was a great idea to keep loud
 
00:57:07.089 --> 00:57:07.099 align:start position:0%
beer to continue through the the beard
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
distribution market so who knows what
 
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
the cut those Distributors are taking
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
beer distributors are taking but at the
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
end of the day when you were looking at
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
how much money the beer guys make before
 
00:57:22.609 --> 00:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
they send it to the distributor to sell
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
it and take their mark up and and the
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
retailer puts his mark up as compared to
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
what the winery is now getting when they
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
sell it at their list price
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
um that's how we stumbled upon the five
 
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:39.349 align:start position:0%
um that's how we stumbled upon the five
percent

00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay so if this motion of Ito fails then
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
I would then entertain a retain motion
 
00:57:46.079 --> 00:57:47.690 align:start position:0%
I would then entertain a retain motion
but

00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what we're retaining at
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
okay so the clerk is the is the motion
 
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
clear anybody else wanna
 
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
okay the clerk will call the role on
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
inexped into legislate on House Bill

so motion is Ito yeah below oh yeah
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
so could you get the chair of science
 
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
and technology did he gets it did he get
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
you did he think that that was funny
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
I have said maybe before in science
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
technology putting money just to then
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
turn up the heat a little bit um keep
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.289 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
uh that's unanimous all those in favor
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
placing it on the consent Calendar
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
please say aye aye those opposed so
 
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the majority report is below
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
I'll rate the blurb that's right okay
 
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
um at this point uh I don't think we're
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
gonna take up 130 because we're we're
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
still working on this drug affordability
 
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
issue so
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
I think we can skip that one for today
 
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
and therefore I rule that we are out of
 
01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:03.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
so I don't think anybody Minds it I just
 
01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
bought them by their last name I mean
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
that's how it usually is right
 
01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:12.349 align:start position:0%
that's how it usually is right
yeah

01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
represent

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Fila
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
Leo they're really okay
 
01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:34.099 align:start position:0%
just know there is no o on the end
 
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
the more uh vowels you put at the end
 
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:51.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%

thank you I think it is okay hold on a
 
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:12.340 align:start position:0%
few minutes
 
01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:16.549 align:start position:0%
few minutes
[Laughter]

01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
I have so many fans at home and then I
