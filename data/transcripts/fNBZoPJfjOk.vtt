just the
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
portion of the presentation that looks
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
at claim volume
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
and trust fund so um this first slide
 
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.629 align:start position:0%
and trust fund so um this first slide
that

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
folks are seeing is uh shows you monthly
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
initial claim numbers just giving some
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
perspective on
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
what we have experienced uh during
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and comparing that back to
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
the great recession and i say comparing
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
that back to the great recession you
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
really can't
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
compare them um neither with the speed
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
with which
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh the claims increased during the
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic and
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
the heights that they reached during the
 
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.950 align:start position:0%
the heights that they reached during the
pandemic

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
they're really uh the they're really um
 
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
apples and oranges um when you look at
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
them um and
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
and what we've been tasked uh with doing
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh you see on that right hand side of
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
your screen with that
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
um dramatic spike um in those monthly
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
numbers compared to
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
back during the great recession when we
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
look at the weekly claims
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
um so on this slide these are the weekly
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
claim filers so people that
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
file a weekly claim in order to trigger
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
a payment of unemployment benefits
 
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
you see on the left-hand side of your
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
screen where we were
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
the week prior to the
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
emergency order from governor sununu
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
expanding eligibility
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
in a few weeks prior to the federal
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
government expanding eligibility with
 
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
the cares act so march 14th 2020 we were
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
just under 4 000 weekly claims
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
um that was uh where we had been for
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
quite some time uh with
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh with you know having experienced um
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
the longest period of recovery
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
in our history with the growth from the
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
great recession
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then quickly things took a different
 
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.790 align:start position:0%
and then quickly things took a different
turn

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
turn
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
we saw our claim volume spiking through
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
march and april and then we
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
peaked um with the week ending may 2nd
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
you see where we were just under 117
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
000 weekly filers so that is the single
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
largest week ever in the history of new
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire's unemployment program
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
those numbers then fell
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
through last summer and
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
the fall then started to go up again
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
with the spike and covet cases uh with
 
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
with the spike and covet cases uh with
late

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
fall and into the winter and then we
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
started 2021
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
um with just over 45 000
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
weekly filers um so a far cry
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
from where we were at the height of the
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic but
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
as you can see um you know
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
about 10 times where we were prior to
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
looking uh to as current as we can get
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
with our numbers
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
that we have from the bureau of labor
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
statistics um we are at 364
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
29 uh with the week of april 17th
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
um something important to be said here
 
00:07:59.039 --> 00:07:59.749 align:start position:0%
um something important to be said here
um

00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
uh is the inside the numbers um and all
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
of the different
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
programs that are part of each of these
 
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:06.790 align:start position:0%
programs that are part of each of these
so

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
obviously with the um the pre-pandemic
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
number of 3909 that was all
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
state ui right because that was our only
 
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.150 align:start position:0%
state ui right because that was our only
program

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
that we had available to individuals for
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
accessing unemployment benefits
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
um then as we get into the pandemic
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
numbers these are a blend of programs so
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's both
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
state ui for those people that qualify
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
for regular state unemployment benefits
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
meaning they had
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
sufficient earnings in their four
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
quarter base period and they had
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
a qualifying separation that was
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
determined not to be the fault
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
of the individual so the most common
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
situation there
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
is some type of layoff but also we have
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
the federal cares act programs for
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
you have the pandemic unemployment
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's the program that's created
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
benefits for self-employed
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
for gig workers and for individuals that
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
need to remove themselves
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
from the labor force due to a pandemic
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
reason for which eligibility
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
was created under the cares act so those
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
are folks that
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
could be dealing with covet themselves
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
could be caring for someone in the
 
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.230 align:start position:0%
could be caring for someone in the
household

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
household
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
that has coveted prior to schools
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
being required to be back offering
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
in-person learning that could have been
 
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.350 align:start position:0%
in-person learning that could have been
apparent

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
apparent
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
with a remote learner um and they are
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
unable to work as a result of the school
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
being closed
 
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
could be someone that is
 
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
could be someone that is
self-quarantined

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
self-quarantined
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
at the advice of their health care
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
provider so that would be someone with
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
an underlying medical condition that
 
00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:40.150 align:start position:0%
an underlying medical condition that
their

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
their medical professional has said um
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
should not
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
be going into a work environment um and
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
um the self-employed and gig workers
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
like i had mentioned
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the federal extension as
 
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.829 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the federal extension as
well

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
so people that have exhausted their
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
state ui
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
they transition into the pandemic
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
emergency unemployment compensation
 
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.110 align:start position:0%
emergency unemployment compensation
program

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
or p-e-u-c and
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
so when we look at a week of april 17th
 
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
2021 that 36425
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
429 includes all of those programs
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
um that breakdown is about uh
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
19 000 people out of that 36
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
000 are in state ui and the balance
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
of them are in either pua which is right
 
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.350 align:start position:0%
of them are in either pua which is right
around

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
9 000 so those are the people that are
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
either self or self-employed
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
a gig worker or remove themselves from
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
the labor force
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and then the balance of that is
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
people who have exhausted state ui
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
and are in the federal extension now um
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
as we'll see in the next slide with the
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
breakdown of dollars
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
everyone or two slides later so um not
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
to get ahead of myself
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
but everyone that's in any of those
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
programs also gets the extra 300
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
a week in that federal enhancement as
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
well and i'll show you a breakdown of
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
those dollars in a minute
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
this slide gives you a comparison
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
of how new hampshire stacks up against
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
i mean we've called out our new england
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
neighbors so you can see where everyone
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
currently sits
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
but what we try to do here is give
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
people a real good sense of
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
the current state of the number of
 
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:30.870 align:start position:0%
the current state of the number of
people

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
filing for unemployment and either state
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
or federal programs as a percentage of
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
our pre-pandemic labor force
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of unexplained
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in labor force numbers as
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
published by bls during the pandemic
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
they have admitted that their numbers
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
are less than reliable
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
um so what we have been doing is we've
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
been comparing
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
our numbers against our pre-pandemic
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
labor force number
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
in order to remove some of that
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
unexplainable fluctuation from bls
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
and as you can see here new hampshire in
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
the red we have the
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
lowest percentage of people filing for
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
in any of the programs either state or
 
00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.670 align:start position:0%
in any of the programs either state or
federal

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
as a lowest in the northeast as a
 
00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:21.350 align:start position:0%
as a lowest in the northeast as a
percentage

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
of our pre-pandemic labor force just
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
under five percent
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
maine you can see is the closest to us
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
here in new england
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh massachusetts is the furthest away
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
from us here in new england
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
um at just over 15 percent
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh kind of grouped in a other states
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
that are having a
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
much more difficult time on getting
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to go back to that prior
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
slide but i wanted to talk about this as
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense to talk about this
 
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.269 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense to talk about this
first

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
this is the dollar breakdown of the
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
money that has been paid out of the
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment system during the pandemic
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
so we've paid out just over 1.82
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in benefits that's more
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
than we paid out in the prior decade
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
this chart gives you a sense of where
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
those dollars have been sourced from
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
so that top line of f puck that's the
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
federal enhancement program so that was
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
the 600
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
enhancement back in 2020 that lasted
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
until july
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
and is currently set at three hundred
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
dollars a week that gets
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
added to everyone that qualifies for a
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount in either ui
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
pua or peuc they get that three hundred
 
00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:47.430 align:start position:0%
pua or peuc they get that three hundred
dollars

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
that goes until september fourth under
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
we've paid out just over a billion
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in just that enhancement
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
um the red bar you see is from our state
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have paid out just over 324 million
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
dollars in benefits
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
we started and i have a slide that will
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
show you where we currently are
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
but just to not build up suspense we are
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
currently at
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
104 million in our trust fund we started
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
at 300 million uh pua we've paid out
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
just over 321 million dollars in pua
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
um importantly all of the the blue lines
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
here are all federally sourced
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
and the only state trust fund source of
 
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.350 align:start position:0%
and the only state trust fund source of
payments

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
is that redline i'm in ui payments
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
lwa we paid out 88 million dollars that
 
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:39.750 align:start position:0%
lwa we paid out 88 million dollars that
was

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
the lost wages assistance program that
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
added 300
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
a week to people's benefits for six
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
weeks back in
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
august and september of 2020 that was
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
done by presidential
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
memorandum at the time um and then
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
lastly the peuc so that's the federal
 
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.509 align:start position:0%
lastly the peuc so that's the federal
extension

00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 58 and a half million
 
00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:00.629 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 58 and a half million
dollars

00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
that has been paid out of that which is
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh federal as well
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
now going back to the slide that i
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
skipped over
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to trust fund solvency
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
right now we have 22 states that have
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
depleted their trust funds
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
there they have borrowed a total of 55
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
or just over 55 billion
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
dollars including 2.2 billion borrowed
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
by massachusetts
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
this is borrowing done in order for them
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
to pay weekly benefits
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
our trust fund remains solvent like i
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
said we are currently at 104 million
 
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.350 align:start position:0%
said we are currently at 104 million
dollars

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
and we are forecasted to stay
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
solvent through 2021 in large measured
 
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
solvent through 2021 in large measured
due

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
due
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
to the 50 million dollars that was
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
provided to the trust fund from
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
federal cares act money in the decision
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
made earlier by governor sununu
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
so the impact on employer tax rates that
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
employers have experienced so far during
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
the first impact that caused their rates
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
to go up was the loss of the fund
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
balance reductions
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
so that that's our statutory solvency
 
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.350 align:start position:0%
so that that's our statutory solvency
control

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
on the trust fund where when the fund
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
reaches 250 million employers
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
get a reduction in their rate of a half
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
point and then at 275 million they get a
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
full point reduction
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
and at 300 million they get a point and
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
a half reduction
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
um as the uh
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
claim roles increased as quickly and as
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
significantly as they did
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
and and the balance in the trust fund
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
fell as quickly as it did those
 
00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:45.509 align:start position:0%
fell as quickly as it did those
reductions

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh were quickly removed because the fund
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
was below that 250 million dollar mark
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
and as a result in the third and fourth
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
quarters of 2020 we had a half
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
point uh statutory surcharge on employer
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
tax rates
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
um we were able to remove that effective
 
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:05.189 align:start position:0%
um we were able to remove that effective
with

00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
the first quarter of 2021
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
we don't expect there to be any
 
00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:11.909 align:start position:0%
we don't expect there to be any
surcharges

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
surcharges
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
for the remaining quarters of 2021
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
and importantly we never
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
implemented the second half point
 
00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.110 align:start position:0%
implemented the second half point
surcharge

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
surcharge
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
um in statute so although
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
employer tax rates have gone up as a as
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
a result
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
of the loss of the fund balance
 
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.270 align:start position:0%
of the loss of the fund balance
reductions

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
they are currently at at what i refer to
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
as neutral
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
um and they're paying at the rate that's
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the result
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
of their experience they are not
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
um having an increased rate because of
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
the surcharges
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh those are not in play right now
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and again uh the the intent of
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh the money from the karzak flex fund
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
in order to avoid those surcharges
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
was so that we weren't creating a
 
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.270 align:start position:0%
was so that we weren't creating a
disincentive

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
disincentive
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
for employers to hire by creating by
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
making it more expensive
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
for them to bring on each additional
 
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.630 align:start position:0%
for them to bring on each additional
employee

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
so employers are at their true
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
experience rate
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
right now however their experience rate
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
is lower right now
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
than it would have been had there not
 
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:21.909 align:start position:0%
than it would have been had there not
been

00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
additional measures taken as a part of
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
the original emergency order that the
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
governor issued back in march of 2020.
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
so all of the benefits that we've paid
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
out that you
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
saw the breakdown by program normally
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
those that are paid out of the state ui
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
trust fund those would be charged
 
00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:39.350 align:start position:0%
trust fund those would be charged
against

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
tax paying employers so when i refer to
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
their experience their experience
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
is both as positive and negative
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
pieces to that the positive being we
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
look at what they've paid in in taxes
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
the negative to the employer is that we
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
apply the benefits paid out to their
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
former employees
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
against their experience that has not
 
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.510 align:start position:0%
against their experience that has not
been

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
going on during the pandemic so during
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
all benefit charges have been direct
 
00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:10.310 align:start position:0%
all benefit charges have been direct
charge

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
to the fund rather than to
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
the experience rate of the tax-paying
 
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.029 align:start position:0%
the experience rate of the tax-paying
employers

00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
the result of that is going to be that
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
as employers see their
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
tax rate determinations that get issued
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
those go out every august
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
and then control your rate for
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
quarters three four one and two
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
those those determinations will not
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
have an increase in their experience
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
rate based on the benefits that have
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
been paid
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
out um that that's important for keeping
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
their rates down
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
and again that's been in place since
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
march of 2020 likewise we have not been
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
requiring non-profits to reimburse the
 
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.230 align:start position:0%
requiring non-profits to reimburse the
fund

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh dollar for dollar for benefits paid
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
out like they normally would
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
so reimbursing employers like our
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other nonprofits who
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
normally would have to reimburse the
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
fund dollar for dollar that has not been
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
taking place
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
as well so that 50 million from the
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
cares act covered
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
that as well so that no one is getting a
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
free ride
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
on the trust fund which was created by
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
the quarterly tax payments from
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
taxpaying employers but all those are
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
are measures that have had impact on
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
employer rates
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i think in large measure what we
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
have seen as rates have stayed
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
much lower than they could have
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
otherwise been
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
certainly and lower than uh was the
 
00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.909 align:start position:0%
certainly and lower than uh was the
experience

00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
from employers following the great
 
00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:53.190 align:start position:0%
from employers following the great
recession

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
recession
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
when they were hit with both surcharges
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
when their experience was hit so their
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
experience rating was going up causing
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
an increase in their rates
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
so none of that has happened we continue
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
to stay solvent
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
and continue to forecast that we'll be
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
able to avoid
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
um and i think this is the last slide
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
and then we can get into overpayments
 
00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:16.330 align:start position:0%
and then we can get into overpayments
and

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:16.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.590 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
appeals related questions this is our
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
updated forecast
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
this is from we have both
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
brian gottlob our director of our
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
economic and labor market information
 
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.350 align:start position:0%
economic and labor market information
bureau

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and one of his economists they do
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
dueling forecasts
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so that we can um they do different
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
methods in their forecasting and that
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
helps us with uh
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
to control and see how each of them
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
are doing how close they are um our our
 
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.190 align:start position:0%
are doing how close they are um our our
band

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
band
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
for where we expect to be finishing 2021
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh right now
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
is a balance between 65 to 84 million
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund and then improvements
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
although not
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
shown here but improvements going into
 
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.950 align:start position:0%
shown here but improvements going into
2022.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
um so um the the fund stays
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
um relatively healthy compared to
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on what we have
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
experienced during the pandemic and
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
the experience of other states and what
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
they have seen so
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
fortunate in that regard that we're able
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
to start
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
with such a healthy trust fund and i'll
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
stop sharing
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
right there and i'll talk a little bit
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
overpayments and appeals as well
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
but first i'll i'll address appeals as
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
not quite as complicated as overpayments
 
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.470 align:start position:0%
not quite as complicated as overpayments
um

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's an it's an area that is difficult
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
to bring on
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
the expertise that you need in a quick
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
fashion i
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
um compare it to
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
a court that's that receives a decade's
 
00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:00.950 align:start position:0%
a court that's that receives a decade's
worth

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
worth
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
of cases in a short period of time
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
can't just go out and grab a bunch of
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
judges off the street to come in and
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
hear those
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
so it requires a certain amount of
 
00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:14.230 align:start position:0%
so it requires a certain amount of
knowledge

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
and a skill level that you can
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
conduct that type of hearing so what
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
we've what we've done
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
we have uh brought in uh we went from
 
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.430 align:start position:0%
we have uh brought in uh we went from
ten

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
ten
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
hearing off our from four hearing
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
officers rather to
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
ten hearing officers currently they are
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
all on the docket
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
they are hearing cases um we have issued
 
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:36.950 align:start position:0%
they are hearing cases um we have issued
a

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
request for proposals out to new
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire law firms
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
in order to supplement our hearing
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
officers for new hampshire licensed
 
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.549 align:start position:0%
officers for new hampshire licensed
attorneys

00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to conduct hearings and issue
 
00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.470 align:start position:0%
to be able to conduct hearings and issue
decisions

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
we felt that was a better alternative
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
bringing in or trying to bring in and
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
skill up
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
other hearing officers that we're only
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to need for a short period of time
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
the efforts that we've uh done in
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
increasing our hearing officers
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
have really started to pay dividends uh
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic we were hearing
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh just under 200 cases per month
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh right now we have over 500 cases
 
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.190 align:start position:0%
uh right now we have over 500 cases
scheduled

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
to be heard in uh this month in may
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
as well as june and because of the
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
additional resources we've brought on
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
that are going through
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
the correspondence that it's received in
 
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
the correspondence that it's received in
appeals

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
appeals
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
um we have another 2500 appeals
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
that are able are ready to be scheduled
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
and are being added to the may
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
june and july dockets uh right now
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
so um we're going through our
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
our backlog that built up um i would say
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last month we're
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
going through it much faster
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
than we were because of some additional
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
resources we brought on from
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
the vendor that supports our
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
unemployment hotline
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
i took 20 of those people and i put them
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
on correspondence review
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
so we receive a lot of correspondence in
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
our appeals section
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
about 30 percent of it are actual
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
appeals so now i have
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
20 additional people going through that
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
they process about
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
32 300 pieces of correspondence a week
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
and so that backlog of correspondence is
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
coming down quickly
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
um that results in more cases being
 
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.230 align:start position:0%
um that results in more cases being
scheduled

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
that's the 2500 that are being added to
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
the docket right now
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
and then um that will also probably
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
result in an increased number of higher
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
level administrative
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
appeals as well requests for reopening
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
cases to our appellate board
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll be prepared for that as well um
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
so those are our appeals numbers uh
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
right now where things stand
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
um with regard to overpayments um
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
overpayments in terms of how they get
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
treated by the department
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
um it depends on a host of factors uh
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not the individual was
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
determined to be at fault and causing it
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
whether or not the dollars for which are
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
overpaid are from a state program or a
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
federal program
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
so that all of that plays a role in
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
what is required to happen uh with
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
regard to an overpayment
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
so what we have for overpayment in terms
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
of number of people
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
and the dollar amounts for those that
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
are at fault so people that
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
um made an inaccurate
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
statement to the department on their
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
initial claim or their weekly claims
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
um or were not
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
truthful um in the information that they
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
provided and i can give you some
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
examples of what that looks like
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
we have about 18 million dollars in
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
overpayments uh to that group it's about
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
12 000 people
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
they have received determinations from
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
if their overpayment is from the state
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
ui program
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
they are notified in that determination
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
that they are not at fault in the
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
creation of it or they are at fault
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
so these people would have been
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
determined that they were at fault
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
in creating the overpayment um and
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
that uh they are required to pay that
 
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.990 align:start position:0%
that uh they are required to pay that
back

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
and so they then have the opportunity to
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
file an appeal uh they have the
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
um seek forgiveness or compromise
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
of that if it's a state overpayment
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
um and then if it's a federal
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
overpayment um
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
we actually um have to uh they the
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
individuals if they don't go through an
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
appeal they have to go through
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
a the waiver process that's set up by
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government um
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
so with those 12 000 that i just
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
discussed of individuals that are
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
determined to be at fault um in the
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
creation of the overpayment about 18
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
so they would not be eligible
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
for a waiver they can request a waiver
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
but if they're ultimately at fault
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
the waiver uh requirements and the
 
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.070 align:start position:0%
the waiver uh requirements and the
federal

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines do not allow us to waive
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
those overpayments
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
so they need to be repaid and the the
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
examples of that
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
like i said it's based on inaccurate
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
um information provided to the
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
department so these are
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
the most common examples are individuals
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
misinformed the department with regards
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
to their separation when they originally
 
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.149 align:start position:0%
to their separation when they originally
filed

00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
filed
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
so there were quite a few people
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
that weren't working at the time
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh prior to the time when they started
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
filing in fact they stopped working in
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
many instances uh back towards the end
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
of 19
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
or maybe they stopped working at the
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
very beginning of 2020.
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
when they filed with the department they
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
would have represented to the department
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
that they had a coronavirus related
 
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
that they had a coronavirus related
separation

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
separation
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
and that it was the pandemic as to why
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
they could not work
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
and come and find out that once we would
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
have received information
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
from the employer which in a lot of
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
cases was not provided timely because
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
the employers were dealing with their
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
own problems right at that time
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
um come to find out the individual would
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
have left employment
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
prior for a personal reason or to seek
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
other employment
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
um and was not unemployed because of the
 
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.430 align:start position:0%
um and was not unemployed because of the
pandemic

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore would have would have been
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
ineligible for
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
for benefits similar are those
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh the self-employed individuals that
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
became eligible during the pandemic
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
previously they had no eligibility for
 
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.950 align:start position:0%
previously they had no eligibility for
unemployment

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and initially when we were trying to
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
set them up and get them into the
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
correct benefit amounts
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
we required affidavits from
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
self-employed individuals
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
that where they would provide us what
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
their earnings were
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
for the prior calendar year so what they
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
had earned in
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
2019 and that was an affidavit
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
and then subsequent to that we received
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
federal guidance saying that all
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
individuals needed to provide
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
documentation to substantiate
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
their self-employment and so
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
we then required those individuals in
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
most cases to provide their 2019
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
schedule c's
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
um in a lot of cases what came in on
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
their 2019 schedule c
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh was much lower than what they had
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
represented to the department in their
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
affidavit as to what their earnings were
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
the impact of that is that they would
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
have been set up at a higher weekly
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
benefit amount
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
as a result of their affidavit earnings
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
and then when we get their schedule c
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
showing much lower earnings or maybe
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
no earnings at all then
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
there is a gap in terms of what their
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
should be and they would be found
 
00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:14.789 align:start position:0%
should be and they would be found
overpaid

00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
overpaid
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
for that gap so um
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
those are um uh the the common um
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
scenarios in that 18 million uh that's
 
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.590 align:start position:0%
scenarios in that 18 million uh that's
about

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
one percent of total benefits that have
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
been paid out
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic um i've
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
i understand uh where the focus lies on
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
some of on some of this
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
but um it it is important to note that
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
the department did get the dollars right
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
and the payments right in over 97
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
percent of the cases despite
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
having a decades worth of volume
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
and a decade's worth of payments i do
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
think the department deserves a lot of
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
credit for getting it right
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
um over 97 of the time
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
and then with these one percent of
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
people that
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
are now found overpaid that do have an
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to appeal
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to get through those as
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
um they they are
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
currently required to repay those
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
benefits and if they appeal then that
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
delayed until that appeal decision um
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
gets issued now with the other with
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
other folks that are not
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
at fault in creating their overpayment
 
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
at fault in creating their overpayment
oh

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
of it one important point i forgot to
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
make their um
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
the program breakdown for that 18
 
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:34.549 align:start position:0%
the program breakdown for that 18
million

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
as the same for the folks that are not
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
at fault
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
about 20 of those dollars are from the
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
state trust fund
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
so about eighty percent of overpayment
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
dollars are from a federal source
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
most of that sixty percent of it is from
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
the federal enhancement
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
um you know when that was six hundred
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
dollars a week and now three hundred
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
dollars a week
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
so eighty percent of the of the
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
overpayment dollars are federal
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
source dollars the other twenty percent
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
are sourced from the state trust fund
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
um getting to the
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
individuals who are not at fault
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
um in the creation of the overpayment so
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's in most cases
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
agency error we're dealing with about 8
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
000 people
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
about 25 million dollars so there are
 
00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
about 25 million dollars so there are
some

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
instances where that is um attributed to
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
employer error
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
where we could have been provided with
 
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
where we could have been provided with
inaccurate

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
inaccurate
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
earnings information but most of that i
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to misrepresent that
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
and suggest that that's um by large
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
measure employer error it's not
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
most of that is agency error and
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
so that's about 25 million dollars of
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
agency error so that individuals receive
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
money they should not have received that
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
they were not
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
eligible for um but um
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
through agency error they did
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
get eligibility determinations and they
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
did get paid
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
um now with regard to those types of
 
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.590 align:start position:0%
um now with regard to those types of
overpayments

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
overpayments
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
if it is sourced from state ui the
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
individual is notified right in the
 
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
individual is notified right in the
determination

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
saying hey you're not at fault in the
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
creation of this overpayment you don't
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
have to pay it back
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay we do that by state statute in
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
and rule on fault federal
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
overpayments states are not allowed to
 
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.829 align:start position:0%
overpayments states are not allowed to
waive

00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
waive
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
or forgive the overpayment in that
 
00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:33.030 align:start position:0%
or forgive the overpayment in that
initial

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
determination the state is required to
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
follow federal waiver procedures where
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
we actually have to look at each case
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
individually first we have to look to
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
see whether or not they are at fault or
 
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.710 align:start position:0%
see whether or not they are at fault or
not

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
if they are not at fault we can proceed
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
to the second prong
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
of the federal waiver test which
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
requires us to look at their financial
 
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.589 align:start position:0%
requires us to look at their financial
circumstances

00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
and to determine whether or not
 
00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.710 align:start position:0%
and to determine whether or not
repayment

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
repayment
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
would create a financial burden on the
 
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.390 align:start position:0%
would create a financial burden on the
individual

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
so that is not something that can happen
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
in that initial determination because we
 
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.430 align:start position:0%
in that initial determination because we
don't

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
have a financial affidavit yet from the
 
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.910 align:start position:0%
have a financial affidavit yet from the
individual

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
so those individuals that are not at
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
fault in the creation of the overpayment
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
they receive instruction
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
on how to go about requesting a waiver
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
that we have a form available to them on
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
our website
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
along with the financial affidavit they
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
are then required to submit both of
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
those to the department
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
and then we look at that to make sure
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they meet that federal standard
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a time intensive process
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
on on those waivers i would prefer to
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
those waivers in a blanket fashion
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
but u.s department of labor has come
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
back to states and says wheat and said
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
we cannot
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
do that we have to look at them one by
 
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.829 align:start position:0%
do that we have to look at them one by
one

00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
so we are doing that right now our legal
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
section is processing
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
these waiver requests and we're moving
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
through them
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
as as quickly as we can right now and
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
individuals as they receive those
 
00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.750 align:start position:0%
individuals as they receive those
notices

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
notices
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
they get the instruction on going to the
 
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:14.870 align:start position:0%
they get the instruction on going to the
uh

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
the appeal route or going through the
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
waiver route
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
um and um we'll be
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
issuing those decisions as quickly as we
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
can on waivers
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's uh so all in all like i
 
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:28.870 align:start position:0%
um so that's uh so all in all like i
said

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
in over 97 percent of payments
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
um they were paid correctly to the right
 
00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.670 align:start position:0%
um they were paid correctly to the right
people

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh to eligible people in the right
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
amount about one percent of payments
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
were paid as a result of the department
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
being provided inaccurate and misleading
 
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.790 align:start position:0%
being provided inaccurate and misleading
information

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
in most cases unless that's reversed on
 
00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:47.829 align:start position:0%
in most cases unless that's reversed on
appeal

00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
those people will have to pay those
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
dollars back and then
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
in about one and a half percent of those
 
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.510 align:start position:0%
in about one and a half percent of those
payments

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
those people were paid they shouldn't
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
have been paid
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's the department's fault and either
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
they are told in the determination that
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay it back if it's
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
state ui
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then if it's a federal source
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
payment they are then given instruction
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
on how to go about requesting a waiver i
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
would expect
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
in those cases where the person is not
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
at fault
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
as long as they complete the form and
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
they complete the financial affidavit
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
i suspect that in the overwhelming
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
majority of those cases
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
that the waiver is going to be granted
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
but again we have to do those
 
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.349 align:start position:0%
but again we have to do those
individually

00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
individually
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll stop there i know that's a
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
lot of information
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
um so i'll try not to keep on going
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
on this topic but mr chairman if the i'd
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
obviously i'll stick around for as long
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
as you need me to answer questions
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner um we do
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that you got 97
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
of this right you were criticized for
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
not paying quick enough and now you're
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
going to be criticized for if you paid
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
made a mistake that you uh
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
are asking for your money back so um
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
what's the uh
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
expression a good no good deed goes
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
unpunished so
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate that obviously this is
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
very complex
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
and um people have a lot of questions
 
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:15.270 align:start position:0%
and um people have a lot of questions
and

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
and you know don't understand things so
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
i have a number of questions but i want
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
to open it up to
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh the members um first
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
are there any hints or any questions
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
here within the lob
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
at first representative seaworth
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
followed by representative sullivan
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i want to
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
follow up on something you said
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
obviously what you talked about is
 
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.349 align:start position:0%
obviously what you talked about is
addressing

00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
the concern from the state side of it
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
but if
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
a constituent is going to be their
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
biggest concern
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
is if they were delayed in getting
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
payment or otherwise
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
had a problem on that end
 
00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.710 align:start position:0%
had a problem on that end
[Music]

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
do you have kind of an overview
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
the squeaky wheel that's the only thing
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
i heard about but do you have an
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
overview statistically
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
of what happened in terms
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
of delays in the normal processing where
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
people who file might have seen
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh extraordinary circumstances
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the time it took to get payment
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative i i would
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'd compare new hampshire's record
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
of timeliness and payment against any
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
other state
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
as chairman infantine had pointed out
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
the criticism early on was
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
not getting the dollars out fast enough
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
even though we were exceeding um
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
our timeliness in terms of how quickly
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
we got dollars out
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
as compared to the great recession even
 
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.910 align:start position:0%
as compared to the great recession even
though

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
our claim loads were um
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
in most instances quadruple quintuple
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
um that which we were seeing in the
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
great recession so i
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
so i think depending on the
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances of someone's claim
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
really dictates how long it takes if
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
they have a complicated
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
claim with a big payout from their
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
employer that needs to be
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
factored in by someone looking at their
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
claim and making sure that they don't
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
get paid
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh too much or are too early because of
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
that payout or they have complicated
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh circumstances of their separation
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
those types of claims always take a
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
little bit longer
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
but in a lot of in a lot of these cases
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
with the particular with the agency
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
error overpayments and the 25 million
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's because we paid too fast
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
we we you know in hindsight if um i'd
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
held on to those claims for those 8 000
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
claims for a few more weeks for another
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
month and a half or so maybe i would
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
had the information i needed from their
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
employer to determine that they weren't
 
00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.829 align:start position:0%
employer to determine that they weren't
eligible

00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
um but you know we were under a lot of
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
pressure to
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
issue payments quickly and that's what
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
we did with the best
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
information we had available at the time
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
knowing what
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
people were dealing with during the
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
early stages
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic right now with the
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
people that are filing like i
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
pointed out before we have both 34 35
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
000 people that are filing right now
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of timing i just had i looked
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
at a
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
claim uh two weeks ago a very
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
complicated claim someone who had been
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
filing during
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
the early stages of the pandemic went
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
back to work uh complicated reason for
 
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
back to work uh complicated reason for
not

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
continuing to work had a big pay up from
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
that employer
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
had part-time earnings as they came back
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
and when they came back we had them back
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
in pace status within two weeks
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
um that's pretty good um considering
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh that we're still dealing with uh
 
00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:56.230 align:start position:0%
uh that we're still dealing with uh
volume

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
volume
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's you know nine times that which
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic so um you know
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
we've we've looked at timeliness
 
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:04.950 align:start position:0%
we've we've looked at timeliness
compared

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
compared
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
for the early stages of the pandemic
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
compared to the great recession we know
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
we paid faster
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that we had 25 million
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
dollars in agency error overpayments
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
that shows you that we were we were
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
paying a little bit too fast
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
in some cases um i do uh i
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
i do think that when you look at total
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
payments made by states
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
um and the percentage of improper
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
payments or overpayments that we got
 
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.710 align:start position:0%
payments or overpayments that we got
wrong

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
when you compare new hampshire against
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
anybody else and we and you can see that
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
we got
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
97.6 uh percent of those dollars correct
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
i think that will stand up well against
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
i would caution against looking at some
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
reports that are available from u.s
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
department of labor right now
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
um most of those are inaccurate uh
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
and itself uh you know they'll admit
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
that those are inaccurate because
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
the the reporting mechanisms that those
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
reports were based off
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
in all states had those shut off
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
intermittently throughout 2020
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
so those are not accurate portrayals of
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
how quickly appeals are being dealt with
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sullivan
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
followed by representative cahill
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
the uh could you explain what the
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
financial guidelines are for the federal
 
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.790 align:start position:0%
financial guidelines are for the federal
waivers

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
what what determines whether somebody
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
gets the waiver or not
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
so the um there's not a a time deadline
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
for the waiver itself so when someone
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
receives a determination
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
that includes an overpayment from one of
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
the federal programs they have
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
they have language in there i'm
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
explaining them the waiver process we
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
have it on our website
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
so there's not unlike an appeal an
 
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.550 align:start position:0%
so there's not unlike an appeal an
appeal

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
someone has to file that appeal within
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
14 days of their determination
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
with a waiver there's not a time limit
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
the standard
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
that is in place for considering those
 
00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:05.990 align:start position:0%
that is in place for considering those
waivers

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
and determines whether the state can
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
grant it or reject it
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
first we have to determine whether the
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
individual is at fault
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
in creation of the overpayment the
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
second prong if the person is not
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
at fault we then look at their financial
 
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.109 align:start position:0%
at fault we then look at their financial
circumstances

00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
and if repayment would create a
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
financial hardship
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to grant it if
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
the person made
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
payments and decisions based on having
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
received those benefits that they
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have otherwise done had they
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
not received those benefits
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's another grounds for finding that
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
they meet the financial
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh part of the test and then
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh the last uh prong of that test is
 
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.309 align:start position:0%
uh the last uh prong of that test is
whether

00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh um repayment would be unconscionable
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
um not really any definition around that
 
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.349 align:start position:0%
um not really any definition around that
um

00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
states are left to implement it
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
as they see as they see fit but again
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think as long as someone is not at
 
00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
i think as long as someone is not at
fault

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
fault
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
i'm hard pressed to think of a scenario
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
that they would not
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
also meet the financial burden portion
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
what you would have to see in someone's
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit to determine that
 
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.430 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit to determine that
they

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
would not uh um be financially uh harmed
 
00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:39.670 align:start position:0%
would not uh um be financially uh harmed
by

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
making repayment they have to be
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
here or what what what's the criteria
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
well you know we have to we have to know
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
their financial circumstances
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's uh been clearly required by
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
the feds and the guidance that they've
 
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:56.870 align:start position:0%
the feds and the guidance that they've
issued

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
issued
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
so we accomplished that by obtaining a
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit which
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
is in the world of financial affidavits
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty short one
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is a two-page financial affidavit
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
where we look at household revenue
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
and income coming in we look at
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
household assets and then we look at
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
household expenses
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
um so the first thing we do is we
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
compare monthly
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
income against monthly expenses um
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
that's our first
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh review to see whether or not we can
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
grant the
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
the waiver then secondarily
 
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
we look to see whether the person has
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
described any decisions that they've
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
made as a result of receiving benefits
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
that um they wouldn't have otherwise
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
done if they hadn't received them maybe
 
00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:44.150 align:start position:0%
done if they hadn't received them maybe
they

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
paid a large amount of credit card debt
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
maybe they paid off
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
um a they paid a semester of college
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
tuition for one of their children
 
00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.829 align:start position:0%
tuition for one of their children
differently

00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
than they would have otherwise done
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
those types of circumstances are looked
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
at that would be grounds
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
for someone meeting that financial
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
test and then the last provision being
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
repayment would be unconscionable um you
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
know i'm careful in how this gets
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
applied because you know some people
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
just because you're you might be in good
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
financial condition
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think that should require you to
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
pay back a benefit that was paid to you
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
as a result of the agency screwing up
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so just because you might have more
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
income than someone else i don't think
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
that should be grounds for denial and it
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
won't be in how new hampshire implements
 
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:36.790 align:start position:0%
won't be in how new hampshire implements
it

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
but we look at all um all
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
portions of that spectrum so we look at
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
whether you know it's going to create
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
financial hardship and having to pay it
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
back we look at whether or not you made
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
decisions that
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
in reliance upon receipt of those
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
dollars that you wouldn't have otherwise
 
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.349 align:start position:0%
dollars that you wouldn't have otherwise
made

00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
and then that catch-all at the end
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not repayment would be
 
00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.190 align:start position:0%
whether or not repayment would be
unconscionable

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
unconscionable
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
it's not our test right it's the it's
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
the federal test
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're required to implement it prior to
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
forgiving repayment of those
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
overpayments from federally sourced
 
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.710 align:start position:0%
overpayments from federally sourced
programs

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
i would rather be able to waive it right
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
in that initial determination like we do
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
with state ui
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
but if we do that we've already been
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
told that it would be
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
held to be out of compliance with the
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
feds and we would not be doing those
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
people any favors because we
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
we would then be subject on audit to
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
having to go back
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
and have the people go through the
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
correct process stephen one more
 
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.109 align:start position:0%
correct process stephen one more
question

00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
yes but yes okay i guess based on the
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
third criteria
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
um i would suggest that all between that
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
would be unconscionable
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
so um provide waivers to everyone um
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative you and i are on the on
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
the same page uh there was uh the state
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
of texas tried doing that
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh following one of their um
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
because these federal programs are based
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
on federal disaster unemployment
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
texas had several recent disasters that
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
required payments under their under
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
federal disaster
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment assistance programs they
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
tried doing that
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
on on one of the instances and and tried
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
by very nature of someone needing
 
00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.230 align:start position:0%
by very nature of someone needing
unemployment

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
that they are just assumed to have met
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
the financial burden
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
um and they granted the waivers to
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
everyone um
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
the feds used that as an example of what
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
states are
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do in kind of their shot
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
across the bow
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
when they put out their guidance on on
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
um one more question of the 25 million
 
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.630 align:start position:0%
um one more question of the 25 million
um

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
that was uh uh not the fault of the uh
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
recipient how much of that was federal
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
and how much of the state
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's a it's a 80 20 split
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
there so 80 percent
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
is from a federal source 20 20 of that
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
is from the state so we're looking at
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
about five million dollars
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh from that total that would be um
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
that would have come from the state
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cahill thank
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you mr lavers
 
00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.349 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you mr lavers
uh

00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
over this period you and i have had many
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
correspondences and
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
conversations and uh i i also want to
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
recognize that the department
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
you and the department have done a great
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
job under very difficult circumstances
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
and they
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
and to add that those claims that were
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
delayed were paid retroactively in full
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
so those people were made whole although
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit inconvenienced because of
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
the delay
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
quite understandable under the deluge
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
that you've experienced
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
so my it appears as though with the
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
state with the state part and
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps even with the federal as long as
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
you were not at fault if you didn't give
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
improper information
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
inaccurate information you're going to
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
be okay is that correct
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think that's an accurate
 
00:51:02.079 --> 00:51:03.270 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think that's an accurate
statement

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
you know what happens next is determined
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
by uh
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
which program from which you were
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
overpaid um
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
easy if you were from state ui we
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
forgive it in that determination
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
if it's from and in most of these cases
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just state ui because in most
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
weeks you also had that federal
 
00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:22.950 align:start position:0%
weeks you also had that federal
enhancement

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
enhancement
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
in play as well so the federal portion
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
of it is
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
more complicated because of that waiver
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
process but at the end of the day
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
it should be the same result an
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
individual overpaid from a state program
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
versus an individual overpaid from a
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
federal program
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
if they are not at fault the end result
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
should be the same
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
and they are not required to make
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
restitution to the state
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
um i think it's um just how i go about
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
overseeing this part of the process i
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
think it's inherently
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
unfair to require someone not at fault
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
in um an overpayment uh being created
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
to then be expected to repay that they
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
the agency made an error they
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
received dollars to which they felt and
 
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.309 align:start position:0%
received dollars to which they felt and
and

00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
thought they were eligible
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's just it's unfortunate that the
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
process for waiving those
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
for the federal portion um requires
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
additional steps on the part of the
 
00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:23.270 align:start position:0%
additional steps on the part of the
individual

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
if there was a way of avoiding that i
 
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:26.630 align:start position:0%
if there was a way of avoiding that i
would

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
jump all over it and there's not
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
so we're doing the best we can with the
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
rules that
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
have been uh provided to us by the feds
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll move those as quickly as
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
we can and we've been
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
trying to make information available to
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
those individuals so that they know once
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
they submit a waiver request
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know we acknowledge receipt of it we
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
tell them we're reviewing it we'll be
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
getting a decision out to them
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
they're not responsible for making
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
payment um during that time period so we
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
try to be clear
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
with that information that we put out to
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
them and we've had that type of
 
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.030 align:start position:0%
them and we've had that type of
information

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
out to the public since november of 2020
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
just letting them know that they're
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
that in a waiver situation that it's
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
being taken and that's under
 
00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.990 align:start position:0%
being taken and that's under
consideration

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't you don't have to do anything um
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
until you hear back from us
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair voila thank you
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to the uh the gig workers
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
self-employed and other you know
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
employers who are kind of
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
closed down or having difficulty
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
responding to your your questions about
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
claims uh
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
is that considered uh faults of the
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
the employee of the claimant if the
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
information didn't come back and then
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
you paid out several thousand dollars
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
and then you know maybe they hadn't
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
really misrepresented anything it's just
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps a misunderstanding or perhaps
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
their vacation pay was paid to them
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
in some cases they didn't understand
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
so if it's a situation where someone is
 
00:53:54.839 --> 00:53:56.790 align:start position:0%
so if it's a situation where someone is
um

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
they're they are truthful to the
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
department on their initial filing
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh but because of information we
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
subsequently receive
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
from their employer that they're
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
determined to be overpaid that person
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
would be without
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
fault in creation of that overpayment
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
a combination of agency and employer
 
00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.790 align:start position:0%
a combination of agency and employer
error

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
error
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
in that type of situation depending on
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
the timing of when the information came
 
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:20.710 align:start position:0%
the timing of when the information came
in

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
but as long as the as long as the inform
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
as long as the person
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
was accurate and truthful with the
 
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:27.910 align:start position:0%
was accurate and truthful with the
department

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have a problem in that
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
type of situation
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%

from geneva thank you mr chairman um
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
back back in april of 2020
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
um while the department was seeing a
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
dramatically increased volume
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
um there was guidance that was put out
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
by then attorney general mcdonald
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
regarding um governor snyder's order
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
on uh a freeze of investments in
 
00:56:05.359 --> 00:56:06.870 align:start position:0%
on uh a freeze of investments in
foreclosures

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
foreclosures
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh the attorney general's guidance
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
specified that at the conclusion of
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency which we thought
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
was going to be a lot sooner
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh that those rents and mortgages were
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
happening today to be
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
full and there was no protection for
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
those folks
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh was there any discussion between
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of uh between the
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and the department
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
of labor
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh surrounding the backlog of claims
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
and how you know something like that a
 
00:56:43.359 --> 00:56:44.309 align:start position:0%
and how you know something like that a
massive

00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
massive
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
financial obligation like that might be
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
unattainable for folks that were still
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
waiting for claims
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
um so they're
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
um at no point in time have we had a
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
massive backlog
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
of claims we've had a high volume of
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
claims throughout
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
including obviously
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
april of 2020 but
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
i could go through the payment totals by
 
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
i could go through the payment totals by
week

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh for that back then um and it would
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
show you that we were paying out a lot
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
of money
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
real fast um but with regard to your
 
00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:21.750 align:start position:0%
real fast um but with regard to your
question

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
um i did not have uh any conversation
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
then attorney general mcdonald or uh
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
with the governor with regard to that
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
measure no
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
the representative your question was did
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
you know any between
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's office attorney general
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
the department of labor this is
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
department employment security
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
so did you mean to say that yeah okay
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
all right and you have a follow-up yeah
 
00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.349 align:start position:0%
all right and you have a follow-up yeah
um

00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
would there be any obstacles that you
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
can think of
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
regarding permanently accepting health
 
00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:55.829 align:start position:0%
regarding permanently accepting health
really

00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
to gain workers um in the face of
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so the question uh just to restate it
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure i have it correctly
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
so the question would be are there any
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
obstacles to extending
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
um unemployment eligibility for gig
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
i know what a gig worker is it's a guy
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
that maybe worked for uber or something
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
like that just could someone tell me
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
what the acronym really means
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
does gig stand for something actually i
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
think it actually comes from
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
like back when musicians would play out
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
they say
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay it was just one or two nights
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
sorry commissioner i just wanted to
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
figure to figure out what the reading
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know what the heck it meant
 
00:58:44.559 --> 00:58:45.030 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know what the heck it meant
so

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
all right um when we talk about gig
 
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:48.549 align:start position:0%
all right um when we talk about gig
workers

00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire we're talking about
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
non-covered employment
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
for the most part so
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
self-employed are part of that so
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic and the changes
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
that were made
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
only those individuals that were in
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
covered employment
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
so most w-2 employment would be
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
people that would be eligible for
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
receipt of unemployment benefits if they
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
had a qualifying separation and had
 
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.430 align:start position:0%
had a qualifying separation and had
enough

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
earnings so the cares act expanded that
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
to both non-covered employment gig
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
workers and
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
self-employed so right now the program
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
under which self-employed and gig
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
workers are paid benefits is the
 
00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:34.710 align:start position:0%
workers are paid benefits is the
pandemic

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment assistance program or pua
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
that was the federal cares act
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
program that created it new hampshire
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
as in all other states signed a state
 
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.349 align:start position:0%
as in all other states signed a state
agreement

00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
with the u.s department of labor to
 
00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:51.109 align:start position:0%
with the u.s department of labor to
participate

00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
in that program as we did for the
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
federal extension as we did
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
for the f-puc program the federal
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
enhancement program
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
right now that program is scheduled to
 
01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:04.069 align:start position:0%
right now that program is scheduled to
continue

01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
until september 4th that was the
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
continuation from the american rescue
 
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.510 align:start position:0%
continuation from the american rescue
plan

01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire participates in that
 
01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.109 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire participates in that
program

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
by virtue of having signed the state
 
01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.109 align:start position:0%
by virtue of having signed the state
agreement

01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
and it continues because of the american
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
rescue plan so those people
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
right now continue to receive benefits
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
through the pua program without a pua
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
program they would not be eligible for
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%

august
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
and then like the state did with its
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination system as they got more
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
capacity they bumped up appointments
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing the same as more law
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
firms come on um
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%

in the first half of march um and
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
so here we are um at the beginning of
 
01:04:35.039 --> 01:04:35.670 align:start position:0%
so here we are um at the beginning of
may

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
um that is uh that's the backlog that i
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
had spoken about that we are going
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
through about 3 000 plus
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
pieces of correspondence a week right
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
now with the 20 additional people we
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
brought on from our vendor that supports
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
our hotline
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
so that's actually um that's going uh
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
that's ramped up real fast since we've
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
brought those people on so we're
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
we'll be through uh march i would say
 
01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:01.910 align:start position:0%
we'll be through uh march i would say
within

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
probably another week to week and a half
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
and we'll be moving into april
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and those hearings are getting um
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're getting back filled into may
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
june um
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
um july then we'll be into august
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
um and then our effort will be to try to
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
move those up
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
that uh get pushed out initially when we
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
bring on more law firms to supplement
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
hearing officers
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
then those hearings are going to get
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
moved up as quickly as we can
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
while those people have a pending appeal
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
they are notified
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
by the department both on our website
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
and with
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
information that's sent out to them in
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
the determination
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
that if there's an overpayment that is
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
that's associated with that they're not
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for the overpayment while
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
their appeal is pending
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
um we had initially um we had
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
systems in place uh that were not very
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
easily to shut off or to change with
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
regard to interest accrual
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
things of that nature and so initially
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
what we told people
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
despite what you might have read in the
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
union leader today um
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
what we told people back in november of
 
01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:09.829 align:start position:0%
what we told people back in november of
2020

01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
um you know in a real hidden spot right
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
front and center on our website
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
we told them we said hey ignore any
 
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.069 align:start position:0%
we told them we said hey ignore any
determination

01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
that you get regarding your overpayment
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
if you have an appeal pending including
 
01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:24.470 align:start position:0%
if you have an appeal pending including
interest

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
because we didn't want them to think
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
that we were requiring them to repay
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
while their appeal was pending so we put
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
that information out in november
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
of 2020 we've since shut that off
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
it took a little while to get the
 
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.069 align:start position:0%
it took a little while to get the
programming

01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
programming
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
changed correctly without screwing other
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
things up
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
but we have that shut off right now so
 
01:06:44.799 --> 01:06:45.430 align:start position:0%
but we have that shut off right now so
that

01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
individuals including people that don't
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
even file an appeal
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
right now they're not getting a
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
a demand notice they're not getting a
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
monthly billing statement
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
from us because we want to get through
 
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.069 align:start position:0%
from us because we want to get through
the

01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
backlog of appeals before we turn that
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
functionality back on
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
so we've tried to be real open and
 
01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.430 align:start position:0%
so we've tried to be real open and
transparent

01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
since november of last year with regard
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
to that so people don't think we're
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
pursuing collection or
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
having their debt accrue interest while
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
cahill thank you again mr chairman mr
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
lavis uh so
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to refer to uh my
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues earlier question about the
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
gig workers
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the issue there is that uh if you're
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
a gig
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
worker uh either self-employed or for
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
uber or door dash or some of the like uh
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
no one's paying in
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
into the system is that not correct
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
correct so they're they're they do not
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
have eligibility
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
under state ui um
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
and so they only have eligibility right
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
now under federal pua which is 100
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
percent paid
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
by the federal government if uh pua were
 
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
by the federal government if uh pua were
gone

01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
gone
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
um if that program were to go away those
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
individuals would not have eligibility
 
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.150 align:start position:0%
individuals would not have eligibility
in

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
the state ui system because the trust
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
fund is made up of tax payments
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
from uh covered employers
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
and those the dollars that they pay in
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
in taxes are the dollars that we pay out
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
and self-employed individuals have never
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
been eligible for unemployment benefits
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
until this pandemic and once the pua
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
program goes away
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
they would lose eligibility under
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
current policy
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
unless obviously the legislature
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
made a change to that policy in terms of
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
who's eligible and
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
mr bishop i have a few questions
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%

for some of the local businesses that we
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
had that were having issues with their
 
01:09:17.679 --> 01:09:18.309 align:start position:0%
had that were having issues with their
unemployment

01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
their employees so again thank you for
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
all that assistance you gave us
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
um during this troubling time um the
 
01:09:24.719 --> 01:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
um during this troubling time um the
question

01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
i have and i'm sure the chairman will
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
cover some of them that i have as well
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
um is when will the trust fund be
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
replenished to
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
be 300 million at the current rates that
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
um so i'll i'll caution uh too much
 
01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:43.430 align:start position:0%
um so i'll i'll caution uh too much
reliance

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
reliance
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
on what i'm going to say about the trust
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
fund forecast because
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
our experience over the course of the
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
really makes you question
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
any type of forecast that goes beyond
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
certainly anything beyond a year
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
is tough in terms of a reliability index
 
01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.229 align:start position:0%
is tough in terms of a reliability index
so

01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
right now we're forecasting as i showed
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
earlier the trust fund to
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
end 2021 in the range
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
of between 65 million to 84 million good
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
news is that we remain solvent without
 
01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.669 align:start position:0%
news is that we remain solvent without
borrowing

01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
borrowing
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
bad news is that we're only at 65 to 84
 
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
bad news is that we're only at 65 to 84
million

01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of 2021. um we are
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
we are anticipating further growth in
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
the fund in 2022
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
based upon the additional
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
hiring that we expect to take place um
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
and less reliance on less reliance by
 
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:37.910 align:start position:0%
and less reliance on less reliance by
individuals

01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
for unemployment benefit payments those
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
numbers have been coming down
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
week to week like i said before we have
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
about 19 000 people that are currently
 
01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.590 align:start position:0%
about 19 000 people that are currently
filing

01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
filing
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the state ui program um
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of a longer range forecast and
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
the when to expect the fund
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
to next uh to be at that 250 million
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
dollar level which triggers the first
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
rate reduction to employers i think
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking at uh
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
probably about three years uh before the
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
fund is able to grow
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
back up to that point and then
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
in order to then achieve the additional
 
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.110 align:start position:0%
in order to then achieve the additional
solvency

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
solvency
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
thresholds of 275 and 300
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
you could be looking at upwards of five
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
years but again
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of question marks there um with
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
regard to the
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
the uh type of growth that we see
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
um following um the dramatic
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
loss of uh large segment of our labor
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
force during the pandemic
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
so it will all be determined by how
 
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:46.950 align:start position:0%
so it will all be determined by how
quickly

01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you my recollection the last time
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i was here
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
through this it did take five years i
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
understand we're only
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
um employers are only paying tax on the
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
first fourteen thousand dollars
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the individual's wage so it takes a
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
while to catch up
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
once that that's why the first quarter
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
of every year
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
is the biggest revenue uh income period
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
for the department after that when
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
people reach that 14
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
000 they're no longer paying the
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax so the second third and
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
fourth quarters
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
money usually goes out more than it
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
comes in it takes a while to catch up
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
um the questions i have for you um mr
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner are some things we've
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
already discussed but i think it's
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
important for
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
people who are listening either online
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
or here in the committee
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
one of the scenarios that occurred he
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
had two individuals not getting along
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
very well
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
in one employer and the employer tried
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
to deal with that
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
the one of the employees quit uh their
 
01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
the one of the employees quit uh their
job

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
and then filed for unemployment received
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
the unemployment the owner
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
was shocked because well i have a job
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
for you and you have to
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
be available to have a job and i have
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
the job
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
why are you paying him unemployment that
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
really had to do with
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
federal money because the individual
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
could claim that they had to stay home
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
to take care of their children and such
 
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.149 align:start position:0%
to take care of their children and such
that

01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
the employer was not going to be charged
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
for unemployment on their tax rate for
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
that individual
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
is that an accurate portrayal of that
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
of what go what goes on in that
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance yes
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's uh you've what you've said is
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
very much accurate so
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
because of the pua program someone
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
could have been offered suitable
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
employment but
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
they qualified for pua because of one of
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
those cares act related reasons in your
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
scenario it was to care for a remote
 
01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.189 align:start position:0%
scenario it was to care for a remote
learner

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
learner
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's largely gone right now
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
with the governor's requirement for
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
in-person learning effective back as of
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
april 19th
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that population of people that are
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
filing under pua because they are the
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
primary caregiver for
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
a student whose school is closed
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh schools are open um and we've been
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
providing that information
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
to individuals that have been certifying
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
to that reason
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
they've been receiving quite a bit of
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
information from us
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
again trying to achieve compliance
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
through education
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
and we've been reminding them the
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
guard rails of that type of eligibility
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
but once you're once the school is open
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
no longer an area of eligibility for
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
someone under pua
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
they could have other eligibility but
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
some that would not be the reason they
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
would now qualify for pua
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
since that job is still open and i
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
believe it's the 23rd of this month
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
individuals receiving unemployment are
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
now going to be required again to go
 
01:14:56.239 --> 01:14:56.630 align:start position:0%
now going to be required again to go
look

01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
for um a job and considering
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
we have people begging for workers in
 
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
do you expect that as of that
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
23rd date if i have the correct date may
 
01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:12.950 align:start position:0%
23rd date if i have the correct date may
23rd

01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
23rd
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
there will be more people coming in to
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
be available for employment
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
i i hope so um you know it's
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
we we turned off the work search
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
requirement for a year
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
um feels like a lot longer than that um
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
what i mean work search is a fundamental
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
pillar of the unemployment program
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
i want to deal with you for as short a
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
duration as possible i want to get you
 
01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.070 align:start position:0%
duration as possible i want to get you
back

01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
to work our re-employment services
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
bureau is
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
a critical component of what the
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
department is all about
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm excited to get back to a point
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
where we can really be
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
helping individuals take advantage of
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
the amount of opportunity that is
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
out there with it seems like every
 
01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.229 align:start position:0%
out there with it seems like every
business

01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
that i drive by is hiring right now we
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
had a job fair
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%

and to participate in activities and
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
make contacts with hiring employers
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
so that they can get back into suitable
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
employment we're going to be doing a lot
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
to educate
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
people in the unemployment system over
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
the next few weeks
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
every single one of them is going to be
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
scheduled for a virtual and
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
or virtual workshop where we're going to
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
take about a half an hour review
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
work search requirements going to go
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
over the screens that they're going to
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
be seeing again
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
explaining to them what uh con the
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
employment contacts look like what act
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
what types of activities
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
qualify make sure they understand about
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
all of the 10 virtual job fairs that we
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
have over the course of this month that
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
is going to cover every single part of
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
with hiring employers being able to
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
showcase their positions to
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
people that now have a work search
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
requirement so we're going to be showing
 
01:17:33.679 --> 01:17:33.990 align:start position:0%
requirement so we're going to be showing
them

01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
and going over all of the tools our
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
offices are going to be back open as of
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
this coming monday
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
where we can people can come in and use
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
our computers and our resource centers
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
to search for work
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
but it's it's really getting back to the
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
way that the unemployment program is
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
intended to function
 
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
states were prior to the pandemic states
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
were measured against one another
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
as to who had the shortest duration of
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment um
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
and and that's because we're a
 
01:18:02.239 --> 01:18:03.189 align:start position:0%
and and that's because we're a
short-term

01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
temporary financial bridge to get
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
someone back to work
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're going to get back
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
to doing and uh i'm excited to be able
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
to start working with people again and
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
i'll be out in all of our offices
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
starting next week um so that we can
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
effectively and safely
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh work with with the public again
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
a few more quick ones you mentioned in
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony or your discussion
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
that you waived the requirement for
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
non-profits to reimburse
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
um unemployment which they would
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
normally have to do was that the same
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
for municipalities or was that just for
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
the non-profits
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
it was the same for municipalities as
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
well okay
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you when you talked about the
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
hearings that you're having uh
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
kind of what representative warden
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
talked about if there's 8 000 out there
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
right now you're only doing 500 a month
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know that would take you know 16
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
months to take care of obviously you're
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
hiring more individuals how many of
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
these hearings are
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
for oh this ballpark
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
overpayment versus denied
 
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
currently denied for new um
 
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.310 align:start position:0%
currently denied for new um
[Music]

01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
people requesting yeah i would i would
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
say the um
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
um it's an important distinction they
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
make because some of these are people
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
that just denied and they disagree with
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
the denial
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
um rather than give you a figure that
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely positive about
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
um let me get back to you on that and
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
give you a rough breakdown
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
of that um one just one quick thing on
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
that mr chairman
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
um there's a tremendous increase in the
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
number of people using the unemployment
 
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.189 align:start position:0%
number of people using the unemployment
system

01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
and people that receive determinations
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
that they don't agree with they then
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
file an appeal so the number of people
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
has caused a spike in the number of
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
appeals being filed
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
but one thing that gets overlooked
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's also
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
increased the amount of appeals being
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
filed is
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
these federal programs require us to
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
issue more determinations per person
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
so before someone can get put on federal
 
01:20:01.199 --> 01:20:01.830 align:start position:0%
so before someone can get put on federal
pua

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
pua
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
we have to issue them a determination
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
denying them state ui
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
some people they don't quite understand
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
um how that process works we've tried to
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
explain it they file an appeal
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
of that those appeal requests then have
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
to get reviewed they then have to get
 
01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:19.510 align:start position:0%
to get reviewed they then have to get
scheduled

01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
might not be intentional the person
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
might have already moved on to pua but
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
it takes time to review all that
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
it bogs things down so there's a lot of
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
extra determinations that we have to
 
01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.590 align:start position:0%
extra determinations that we have to
issue

01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
on each of these claims which also
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
increases that claim load and that
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
appeals load
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
my point mr was that hopefully um
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
more deference to those that are denied
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
that are looking for unemployment versus
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
the ones that were
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
trying for the repayments for um which
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know obviously one is more urgent
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
than the other the the
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
the next round the next question i have
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
really has to do with this repayment
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's clear from hearing you today that
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have the state amount and then we
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
have the federal amount
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we have these individuals who um 8
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
000 individuals
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
you feel um it is not their fault why
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
they were overpaid
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
so the situation that has been brought
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
to my attention as an individual
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh had a hearing uh was determined he
 
01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:18.629 align:start position:0%
uh had a hearing uh was determined he
was

01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh it was not his fault he was overpaid
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
he had to provide
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
the federal affidavit individuals like
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
why do i have to
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
provide the affidavit you already said i
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
i don't uh
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's not my fault so then um
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the meantime he is still on
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment a certain amount was taken
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
out of his unemployment check this week
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
to still pay it off even though it was
 
01:21:42.639 --> 01:21:44.229 align:start position:0%
to still pay it off even though it was
waived

01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
waived
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
so obviously that's from the federal
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
part and
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
so you have to take care of both the
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
state part
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
and the federal part you make one
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
determination from the state
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
based on your own set of rules then you
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
have to follow the federal set of rules
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to waive that part and while
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
you're waiting for that
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
the state still has the ability to try
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
to collect some of that money back
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
from so in the in the situation uh mr
 
01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
from so in the in the situation uh mr
chairman

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
with someone that i think you described
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
someone who had had had their appeal
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and they were determined to be
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
without fault
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
right that person um unless there's
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
another overpayment
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know maybe a pre-existing
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
overpayment from prior to the pandemic
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
or something else going on
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have their benefits being
 
01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:33.189 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have their benefits being
offset

01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
offset
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
um in fact i'm more than happy
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
if you could send that one to me so i
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
can look at because we've actually shut
 
01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:40.550 align:start position:0%
can look at because we've actually shut
off

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
our offset capability right now
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
however even if we hadn't shut off the
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
offset capability
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
every individual when they receive the
 
01:22:51.679 --> 01:22:52.709 align:start position:0%
every individual when they receive the
determination

01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
that finds them overpaid in that
 
01:22:55.199 --> 01:22:56.229 align:start position:0%
that finds them overpaid in that
determination

01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
there are instructions explaining to
 
01:22:58.800 --> 01:22:59.590 align:start position:0%
there are instructions explaining to
them

01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
that if they don't appeal and they
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
continue to file
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
that their future payments could be
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
offset to repay their debt and if they
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
would like to avoid that
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're given instruction right there
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
right in that decision saying
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
contact this number and they will work
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
with you on establishing a payment
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
agreement that
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
is consistent with your current
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
financial ability to pay
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
so it's always a situation that can be
 
01:23:28.239 --> 01:23:29.110 align:start position:0%
so it's always a situation that can be
avoided

01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
we've currently shut off our offset
 
01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.030 align:start position:0%
we've currently shut off our offset
functionality

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
functionality
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
right now but as long as someone reaches
 
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:36.629 align:start position:0%
right now but as long as someone reaches
out

01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
and follows that instruction on the
 
01:23:38.239 --> 01:23:40.310 align:start position:0%
and follows that instruction on the
determination

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
they should not be having that a large
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
portion of their unemployment benefit
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
offset to repay a debt i will get that
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
information over to you the last thing i
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
would request but
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
if you would send along also a copy of
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
your powerpoint presentation that you
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
presented to us so i can get it to the
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of good helpful numbers
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
that we can share with our constituents
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
i want to keep within the noon time here
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
finished with my questions uh any other
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions here in the llb
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
seeing on any online and last final
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the commissioner
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much um uh
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
mr commissioner we appreciate it uh

01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
good job

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
polite you said 97 was 97.6 some people
 
01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.229 align:start position:0%
polite you said 97 was 97.6 some people
would

01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
some people would round that up to 98 so
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate your candor um and um
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
and the fact that you are trying
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
the best you can to get additional
 
01:24:44.639 --> 01:24:46.149 align:start position:0%
the best you can to get additional
employees

01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
or law firms in to the department to
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
help with these um
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
overpayments one of the only other
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
things um
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
something i would ask you to work on and
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
i understand you're doing the best you
 
01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.709 align:start position:0%
i understand you're doing the best you
can

01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
one of the complaints i had is that
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes very difficult to get through
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
on the telephone
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
and talk to someone that knows what
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
they're doing um
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
or at least i i take that back that was
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
incorrectly stated getting to the right
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
person for their issue
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
um is it easier and
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
more efficient for you folks if they
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
email versus call in
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
um the call-in is still the best way the
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
way that the hotline currently works
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
is we have it's a tiered structure i'll
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
be i'll be brief with this mr chairman
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
um we have a vendor on on tier one that
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
all the calls
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
go into or the or the lion's share of
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
the calls go into
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
they've been skilled and trained on how
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
to handle most
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh basic unemployment related questions
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh we give them
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
weekly sometimes daily training on
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
current hot topics and what we see for
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh topics for uh that are causing a
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
spike in calls
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
if they cannot handle it they then
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
transfer it immediately to tier two
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
tier two or department employees these
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
are all of our staff
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
in the local offices that are spending
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
their days
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
on the phone answering questions so
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
we have about ten thousand calls a week
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
right now that we're receiving
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
um four to five thousand of those end up
 
01:26:15.199 --> 01:26:15.669 align:start position:0%
um four to five thousand of those end up
getting

01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
transferred in and handled by our local
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
office staff
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
so um that's the best route for getting
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
a question with regard to your
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility answered
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
now what i've found because a few people
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
have my email address
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
it tends to get plastered all over
 
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
social media
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
i can't keep my voicemail
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
down to a number that i you can leave a
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
message um
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
when uh those people that they complain
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
to me about the hotline it's not that
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
they haven't been able to get an answer
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
they don't like the answer that they've
 
01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.790 align:start position:0%
they don't like the answer that they've
gotten

01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
and so sometimes i'll be the first to
 
01:26:54.639 --> 01:26:55.030 align:start position:0%
and so sometimes i'll be the first to
admit

01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
admit
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
the the vendor staff that we have who
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
have been quickly trained up
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes their the answer they provide
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
could have been better
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
and the person is rightfully agitated
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
by the lack of being able to get the
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
answer they need
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
other times it's they the answer that
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
they got is not the one they wanted
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
excellent well thank you very much um
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that you have a great day
 
01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.590 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that you have a great day
commissioner

relative to the minimum hourly rate for

representatives is representative
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
timothy horgan representative you're
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay i'm uh i was i'm surprised that i'm
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
speaking um but i'm i'm opposed to
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 137
 
02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
for the simple reason that it uh lowers
 
02:32:22.389 --> 02:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
the min
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
the wage for tips employees who are
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
often um
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
we found out how valuable they are
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic which is still going
 
02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:30.150 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic which is still going
on

02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
but uh you know they're they're
 
02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
underpaid they're overworked they're
 
02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
underappreciated and this just pays them
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
pays them less and then also the whole
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know because it's 327 an hour
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
basically um senator bradley is not here
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
to explain why he did it but
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
that is about 45
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
of uh current 725 and certainly
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
i assume this is going to assume this is
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
in anticipation
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the possibility that the federal
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
minimum wage which is also our state
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
minimum wage will be uh
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
will be will be increased um so that's
 
02:33:03.439 --> 02:33:04.790 align:start position:0%
will be will be increased um so that's
uh

02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
and also like probably think a lot of
 
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
the other things in rsa279
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
21 need to be changed but this bill just
 
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
affects that one thing so i think that's
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh not a good change if you're gonna
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
change it at all
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
the uh base rate should be higher in
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
fact it probably
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
should just be the federal minimum wage
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
and then the tips are on top of that so
 
02:33:24.319 --> 02:33:24.550 align:start position:0%
and then the tips are on top of that so
i

02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
think that uh with the tips um
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
i think basically the way it works the
 
02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
base wage is what the uh
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
but the owner of the restaurant or the
 
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
other facility
 
02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
pays you to be there even if there's no
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
customers there and then um
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
the tips are on top of that are for
 
02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:42.550 align:start position:0%
the tips are on top of that are for
providing

02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
providing
 
02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
the service for the employees and it's
 
02:33:45.990 --> 02:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a strange way
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
to compensate people but that's what
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
evolved and um
 
02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
some ways i'm glad to do it because at
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
least i can uh
 
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
i can make sure they're paid leaves a
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more than the uh
 
02:33:58.950 --> 02:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
the absolute minimum so that's uh i mean
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
i do understand the uh
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
the tourist industry is a key industry
 
02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
in our country in our especially
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
in our country in our state but actually
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh they're having trouble finding
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
employees one is it maybe because the
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
pay rates are are too low given the uh
 
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
what the labor market is like because
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
we're having um so i i
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
i stay this bill uh still
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
been i t owned in the past and um it
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
should be it'll begin so that's uh
 
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's basically all i have to say about
 
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
it i probably probably much more
 
02:34:32.469 --> 02:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
go on more about the technical details
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
than i can but if you want to ask me a
 
02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
question i'll know

02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none of any questions for the
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
i don't see any thank you representative
 
02:34:51.270 --> 02:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
morgan well thank you
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:56.840 --> 02:34:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
senator

02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
there you go sorry about that mr
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and i apologize for being
 
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
late um
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
so pleased to be here in support of uh
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 137 which the senate passed
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
um this is a very simple bill and it's
 
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
especially with the discussion in
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
washington about
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
while it hasn't happened yet uh
 
02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:34.870 align:start position:0%
while it hasn't happened yet uh
certainly

02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
it could and there are a lot of people
 
02:35:39.510 --> 02:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
pushing for it what that would mean
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
given our tying of the minimum wage
 
02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to the federal minimum
 
02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:46.150 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to the federal minimum
wage

02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
would be nearly or actually more than a
 
02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:51.349 align:start position:0%
would be nearly or actually more than a
doubling

02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
doubling
 
02:35:54.510 --> 02:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
of the current tipped wage to i believe
 
02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:55.670 align:start position:0%
of the current tipped wage to i believe
6.75

02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
6.75
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
cents an hour um by virtue of the fact
 
02:35:58.880 --> 02:35:59.190 align:start position:0%
cents an hour um by virtue of the fact
that

02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
we are tied at 45 to the minimum wage
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
i think we all are very very aware
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the duress and the ongoing pressure
 
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
that our hospitality industry and
 
02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:15.830 align:start position:0%
that our hospitality industry and
particularly

02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
restaurants are under and are going to
 
02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
continue to be under
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
many of them have barely survived if
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
they've survived at all the pandemic
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
and the potential of more than
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
doubling the tipped wage
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
is something that could put many
 
02:36:35.439 --> 02:36:36.710 align:start position:0%
is something that could put many
restaurants

02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
under the um just continued duress
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
and and caused them to fold there was a
 
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
lot of support
 
02:36:48.150 --> 02:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
in the senate amongst the hospitality
 
02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:48.790 align:start position:0%
in the senate amongst the hospitality
industry

02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
for this i think you will hear that
 
02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:52.630 align:start position:0%
for this i think you will hear that
discussion

02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
today from many of the same folks that
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
we heard the discussion the one um
 
02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
thing that i would add mr chairman is
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
the contingency
 
02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
section on line 19 and 20 of the bill
 
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
that this only takes effect
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
if the minimum wage is raised federally
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
so if nothing changes
 
02:37:18.309 --> 02:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
nothing changes in new hampshire the
 
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
only other thing that i would add mr
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
chairman is
 
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that the vast majority
 
02:37:24.550 --> 02:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
of a
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
tipped employee's salary comes from
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
tips not the minimum wage and so by
 
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
raising the cost
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
as this would do if the federal minimum
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
wage went up and new hampshire's law
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
employers in the hospitality industry to
 
02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:46.469 align:start position:0%
employers in the hospitality industry to
move

02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
move
 
02:37:50.309 --> 02:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
to more tablets replacing people
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
and downshift or reduce hours
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of shifts it would
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
probably lead to job loss and
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
there would not be a corresponding gain
 
02:38:04.389 --> 02:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
for an awful lot of people
 
02:38:06.389 --> 02:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
that could well find themselves out of
 
02:38:07.750 --> 02:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
work if
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
this happens raising the minimum wage as
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
i've always said is well intended but it
 
02:38:13.439 --> 02:38:14.309 align:start position:0%
i've always said is well intended but it
has

02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:38:17.429 --> 02:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
that consequence of job loss we want to
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
our hard-working restaurant owners
 
02:38:25.270 --> 02:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
are able to survive this pandemic and
 
02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:26.870 align:start position:0%
are able to survive this pandemic and
survive

02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
survive
 
02:38:29.110 --> 02:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
a doubling of the minimum wage without
 
02:38:30.790 --> 02:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
the tipped wage in new hampshire going
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
up so
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
i support the bill obviously and happy
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley questions in
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
the lob robertson vatican
 
02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
senator bradley i would
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
beg your patience as i have a couple
 
02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
questions to go for you
 
02:38:56.469 --> 02:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at line nine
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh in bill tipton
 
02:39:02.309 --> 02:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
line eight to nine tips employees were
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
licensed as secondary game operators
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
um uh would receive a base rate from the
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
employer not less than 7.25 an hour
 
02:39:17.349 --> 02:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
um could you define
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
um what a secondary game operator
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
pursuant to that rsa is and why
 
02:39:25.750 --> 02:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
the senate felt an appropriate intimate
 
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
a special part of that
 
02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
in this legislation so we
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
made that addition to the legislation
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
as a result of
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
the secondary game operators coming to
 
02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:42.469 align:start position:0%
the secondary game operators coming to
us

02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:39:45.190 --> 02:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
and saying they had tipped employees
 
02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
that would be subject to the
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
minimum wage increase so we added that
 
02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:52.150 align:start position:0%
minimum wage increase so we added that
in

02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
per their request since they are also
 
02:39:57.750 --> 02:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
tipped wages we did the same with cigar
 
02:39:57.760 --> 02:39:58.630 align:start position:0%
tipped wages we did the same with cigar
bars

02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
bars
 
02:40:03.750 --> 02:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:07.830 --> 02:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand including them
 
02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
um but it seems like based on the
 
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
language they would be making
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
more um securely
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh without the compensation tips than
 
02:40:20.710 --> 02:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
they would
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh were they restaurant burgers is that
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
not the case
 
02:40:27.670 --> 02:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that um somebody representing
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
the secondary game operators and the
 
02:40:32.230 --> 02:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
cigar bars will testify
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
um and i guess i'd ask you to ask them
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
follow up um you mentioned in
 
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
your testimony of the potential
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
downsides to
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
increasing the minimum wage
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
would have on restaurant employment um
 
02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
however a study from the economic policy
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
institute suggested that
 
02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
the seven states that don't have a
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
separate tip to minimum wage
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
are all currently experiencing higher
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant growth rates
 
02:41:05.830 --> 02:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
and have the same higher rates of
 
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
tipping as the states with a sub minimum
 
02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:09.830 align:start position:0%
tipping as the states with a sub minimum
wage

02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
do you feel that's accurate or no so i
 
02:41:16.309 --> 02:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
think that um the senate heard testimony
 
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
and you certainly can pull up the
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
hearing report
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and i suspect you'll hear testimony
 
02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:22.469 align:start position:0%
um and i suspect you'll hear testimony
today

02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
from restaurant owners i mean that's
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know the most accurate summation i
 
02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
think of
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
what they're feeling and what they're
 
02:41:34.469 --> 02:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
facing if the minimum wage increases and
 
02:41:34.479 --> 02:41:35.349 align:start position:0%
facing if the minimum wage increases and
so

02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
the senate uh wanting to protect them
 
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
and protect those jobs and to try to
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
keep them viable
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's why we passed this bill
 
02:41:47.990 --> 02:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up thank you mr chairman
 
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up thank you mr chairman
um

02:41:49.030 --> 02:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
again looking at the bill uh reading
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
from line
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
15 uh if an employee shows the
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
satisfaction commissioner that the
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
actual amount of wages received at the
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
end of the pay period did not equal the
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for all hours work
 
02:42:04.950 --> 02:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
the employer shall pay the employee the
 
02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
difference to guarantee the applicable
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
given that new hampshire doesn't have
 
02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
its own minimum wage
 
02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
the supremacy laws the constitution
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
defers that we follow to
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:22.950 --> 02:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
is an employer not just making up the
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
the tips and 15
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
an hour regardless of what the base
 
02:42:31.590 --> 02:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is set at
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
because it just feels it just feels like
 
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's the same amount of money
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
and the employee would be making that
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
closer to 15
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
an hour anyways and this just feels like
 
02:42:42.550 --> 02:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
a very
 
02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
hat on a hat kind of retracted well
 
02:42:47.990 --> 02:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
first of all representative lines 15
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
through 18
 
02:42:53.429 --> 02:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
are existing statutes so um
 
02:42:58.550 --> 02:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
understood

02:43:03.910 --> 02:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
oh you're recognized thank you mr chair
 
02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:19.349 align:start position:0%
oh you're recognized thank you mr chair
um

02:43:19.349 --> 02:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
senator bradley uh thank you for coming
 
02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:23.349 align:start position:0%
senator bradley uh thank you for coming
today

02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
just have a couple questions just for my
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
own edification
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh in your testimony mentioned um
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
that if the minimum wage which we follow
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
is federal um where it were to go up and
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
double that you know
 
02:43:42.309 --> 02:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
potential job loss uh potential uh
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
businesses would be under a hardship
 
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
hard to maintain costs
 
02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
might even put them out of business my
 
02:43:52.399 --> 02:43:53.110 align:start position:0%
might even put them out of business my
question

02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:56.550 align:start position:0%
question
is

02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
that would occur to all businesses
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
so why is this bill singling out a
 
02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:03.670 align:start position:0%
so why is this bill singling out a
certain

02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
subgroup of people to protect
 
02:44:10.389 --> 02:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
well the reason for that representative
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
our statute in new hampshire ties
 
02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage for tipped employees
 
02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
to 45 percent of the applicable
 
02:44:25.349 --> 02:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
minimum wage so my understanding
 
02:44:30.309 --> 02:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
is the federal
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
tipped minimum wage is actually below
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
our 327 mark now if the federal
 
02:44:42.150 --> 02:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
if congress also raises the minimum
 
02:44:44.870 --> 02:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
tipped wage federally then obviously
 
02:44:47.830 --> 02:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
that would supersede new hampshire law
 
02:44:51.030 --> 02:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
but if it leaves it alone the fact that
 
02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
our 45 percent
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
of whatever the federal minimum wage
 
02:44:59.429 --> 02:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh would more than double it so that's
 
02:44:59.439 --> 02:45:00.950 align:start position:0%
uh would more than double it so that's
why

02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
the carve out obviously you know there's
 
02:45:05.269 --> 02:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
been a debate
 
02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
for many years in new hampshire about
 
02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:08.469 align:start position:0%
for many years in new hampshire about
raising

02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
raising
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage and as i think i
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
indicated before it is well intended
 
02:45:16.389 --> 02:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
some people benefit but then especially
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
entry-level workers first-time job
 
02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:20.550 align:start position:0%
entry-level workers first-time job
seekers

02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
seekers
 
02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
who need that first job may get priced
 
02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:24.309 align:start position:0%
who need that first job may get priced
out

02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
of that first job with an increase in
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
but that's a different debate
 
02:45:34.389 --> 02:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's a debate about the overall
 
02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
minimum wage this
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
is just about tipped employees
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
remembering the vast majority of a
 
02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:42.790 align:start position:0%
remembering the vast majority of a
tipped

02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
tipped
 
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
um employee's salary should be from tips
 
02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
not you know the stipend that they're
 
02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
paid and
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
but at the same time the cost to
 
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant tours
 
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
by doubling that is going to lead to
 
02:45:59.110 --> 02:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
price increases
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps less tips less jobs
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
and an overall problem i think
 
02:46:08.790 --> 02:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
for the restaurant industry in new
 
02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:09.429 align:start position:0%
for the restaurant industry in new
hampshire

02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why you know this is a narrow
 
02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
bill not a broad bill on the minimum
 
02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
wage it's
 
02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
specific because new hampshire has that
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
45 percent
 
02:46:25.110 --> 02:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
um you know tying to the federal minimum
 
02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:27.429 align:start position:0%
um you know tying to the federal minimum
wage

02:46:27.429 --> 02:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative turcotte
 
02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
followed by representatives
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
bradley uh one question
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
on uh beginning online 11 and going to
 
02:46:40.389 --> 02:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
14 there's a
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph that starts with if such an
 
02:46:44.309 --> 02:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
employee shows the satisfaction
 
02:46:47.429 --> 02:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
on and on and on uh further down in line
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
14 through 18 there seems to be almost
 
02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:51.030 align:start position:0%
14 through 18 there seems to be almost
duplicative

02:46:51.030 --> 02:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
duplicative
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh wording can you explain
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
is there a difference there honestly
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
i've read through that about 10 times
 
02:46:59.590 --> 02:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to figure out
 
02:47:04.830 --> 02:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
there

02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
so i know that in the senate
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
test uh hearing um
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
there was testimony from the department
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
of labor sorry to deflect that question
 
02:47:29.279 --> 02:47:29.750 align:start position:0%
of labor sorry to deflect that question
but

02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
um it might be better to ask
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
the department would you repeat that
 
02:47:41.670 --> 02:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
i i don't follow you representative line
 
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
if you start on uh line 11 mr chairman
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
if such an employer shows to the
 
02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:48.389 align:start position:0%
if such an employer shows to the
satisfaction

02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
satisfaction
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
and that continues in bold through line
 
02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
four it does look to be the exact same
 
02:47:52.720 --> 02:47:53.910 align:start position:0%
four it does look to be the exact same
language

02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:47:56.710 --> 02:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
there's a very very very slight
 
02:47:59.190 --> 02:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
difference but to me the intent is
 
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
the same so i'm trying to figure out if
 
02:48:02.309 --> 02:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:48:04.389 --> 02:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
actually an intent or if it's a drafting
 
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
error or just
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't look right to me uh
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
going further mr chairman on line
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
14 at the very end it starts again
 
02:48:16.389 --> 02:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
if an employee shows to the satisfaction
 
02:48:17.590 --> 02:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
on and on and on
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
and again other than i don't even
 
02:48:20.319 --> 02:48:20.790 align:start position:0%
and again other than i don't even
remember

02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
remember
 
02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
one or two minimum one or two word
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
differences it's the exact same
 
02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
intent i believe but i must have the
 
02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
wrong i'm looking at
 
02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh amendment to senate bill 137
 
02:48:36.630 --> 02:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
amendment 2021-0983
 
02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:44.070 --> 02:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay i want to make sure we're actually
 
02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think what we should be looking at is
 
02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:48.230 align:start position:0%
i think what we should be looking at is
uh

02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:52.389 --> 02:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
sp 137 as a i think that's probably
 
02:48:52.399 --> 02:48:57.590 align:start position:0%
sp 137 as a i think that's probably
represented

02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
i i didn't hear what you said
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan
 
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at sp 137 as amended by the
 
02:49:07.269 --> 02:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
senate i'm not looking at it
 
02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
okay and i think perhaps i'm guessing
 
02:49:12.950 --> 02:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
that when the amendment was incorporated
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
into the bill
 
02:49:18.469 --> 02:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing also but again as written
 
02:49:22.469 --> 02:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear
 
02:49:25.990 --> 02:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
correct so all right we will
 
02:49:28.389 --> 02:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah mr chairman this is uh
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
jeb again
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
i think uh the questioner is correct
 
02:49:35.830 --> 02:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
um it appears to be a drafting error but
 
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
um i trust you folks to sort that out
 
02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
trust thank you yes trust
 
02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative seawork thank you mr
 
02:49:51.429 --> 02:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator
 
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
this may be another one you that's worth
 
02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:55.750 align:start position:0%
this may be another one you that's worth
deferring

02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
deferring
 
02:49:58.870 --> 02:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh to someone later my question
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
is also on line 11 but
 
02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
the first part of that line where
 
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
and in some of the testimony we talked
 
02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:09.110 align:start position:0%
and in some of the testimony we talked
about

02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
what the different minimum wages would
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
be for tipped employees
 
02:50:18.469 --> 02:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
um this seems to introduce a new one
 
02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
at 7.25 an hour that is neither
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
45 of the new one nor is it the old one
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it again it seems strange to me
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
for the particular class of secondary
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
game operators
 
02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
to introduce a minimum wage that doesn't
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
match any of the others
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
so from the standpoint of the senate
 
02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:43.670 align:start position:0%
so from the standpoint of the senate
amendment

02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
is there an intent there that we should
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
be aware of
 
02:50:49.110 --> 02:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
or is that something i should bring up
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
02:50:53.030 --> 02:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
you'd probably be best advised to bring
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
that up with the
 
02:50:57.429 --> 02:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
representatives of the tipped employees
 
02:50:57.439 --> 02:50:57.910 align:start position:0%
representatives of the tipped employees
for

02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
secondary game operators because this
 
02:51:02.389 --> 02:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
was the language that they
 
02:51:06.790 --> 02:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
asked us to insert and it may be
 
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the existing rsas
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:15.590 --> 02:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
all right that's all the questions here
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the llb the questions online
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:51:36.479 --> 02:51:37.190 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you
senator

02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:51:40.630 --> 02:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um
 
02:51:43.349 --> 02:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
senator had have you seen the studies
 
02:51:44.950 --> 02:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
that are out there
 
02:51:48.630 --> 02:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
that show that when you increase wages
 
02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
that you increase the productivity of
 
02:51:52.630 --> 02:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
the employees
 
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
and you lower the turnover rate which is
 
02:51:56.080 --> 02:51:56.630 align:start position:0%
and you lower the turnover rate which is
a

02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:51:59.990 --> 02:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
very big cost to an awful lot of
 
02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants to be able to train
 
02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:03.750 align:start position:0%
restaurants to be able to train
employees

02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:52:06.550 --> 02:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question so
 
02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that if the
 
02:52:10.230 --> 02:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh restaurant owners thought it was in
 
02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
their best interest
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
financially they would
 
02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
raise that tipped wage themselves
 
02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
that being said certainly the testimony
 
02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the senate revolved around you know
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
the financial duress that would put many
 
02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
restaurant owners
 
02:52:33.510 --> 02:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
under given the vagaries and the
 
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
pressures that they've faced through the
 
02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:37.590 align:start position:0%
pressures that they've faced through the
pandemic

02:52:37.590 --> 02:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the fact that even as
 
02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know people are starting to get
 
02:52:45.030 --> 02:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and go back to restaurants
 
02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:45.830 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and go back to restaurants
now

02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's still a diminished diminished
 
02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:49.349 align:start position:0%
it's still a diminished diminished
capacity

02:52:49.349 --> 02:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
um you know in their business it may
 
02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:52.790 align:start position:0%
um you know in their business it may
change

02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
but i think they feel the duress and
 
02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
they've been under that duress for a
 
02:52:59.510 --> 02:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
long time and so
 
02:53:02.150 --> 02:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
um i think the senate took that
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
testimony seriously
 
02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
given the pressure that restaurants are
 
02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:09.510 align:start position:0%
given the pressure that restaurants are
under

02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um any other questions online
 
02:53:19.349 --> 02:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
senator bradley uh
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
i know you're you've expressed a concern
 
02:53:27.030 --> 02:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
that if the wage the federal wage goes
 
02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
to fifteen dollars
 
02:53:32.230 --> 02:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
that it would double the uh tipped rate
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh it may be unlikely it may only go to
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
eleven or twelve do you have a
 
02:53:37.990 --> 02:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
contingency for
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
that would would it not be more in line
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
more reasonable to have
 
02:53:44.469 --> 02:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
if it went to 12 it would be like 5 and
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
40 cents an hour
 
02:53:48.389 --> 02:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
and again this is only paid it's only
 
02:53:50.070 --> 02:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
making up the difference when the tips
 
02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
were so
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
which we're told the tips are twenty
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour it's only when the tips
 
02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
aren't twenty dollars an hour but the
 
02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
employer has to make up the difference
 
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
would would that be reasonable to havoc
 
02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:01.830 align:start position:0%
would would that be reasonable to havoc
uh

02:54:01.830 --> 02:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:54:03.429 --> 02:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
maybe i know that there was a bill to
 
02:54:05.349 --> 02:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
lower the percentage uh
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
you know in the event middle business
 
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
can be scaled down a bit
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
um there's you know in my view
 
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously it would have less of
 
02:54:18.230 --> 02:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
an impact
 
02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
on a restaurant owner but
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
just reading the tea leaves
 
02:54:28.469 --> 02:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
i think the pressure is on
 
02:54:31.429 --> 02:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
to raise the minimum wage to at least 15
 
02:54:32.469 --> 02:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
02:54:35.349 --> 02:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
and there's as much pressure to raise it
 
02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
higher than fifteen dollars an hour in
 
02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:38.230 align:start position:0%
higher than fifteen dollars an hour in
washington

02:54:38.230 --> 02:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
washington
 
02:54:40.710 --> 02:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
as there is to be somewhere between
 
02:54:42.710 --> 02:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
seven twenty five and fifteen
 
02:54:46.790 --> 02:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
so what happens who knows regardless
 
02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
tipped employees you know while this
 
02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
you could argue would benefit them
 
02:54:56.389 --> 02:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
even if the minimum wage say went to 12
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
not 15
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and their percentage went to about six
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
dollars as opposed to 6.75
 
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
it still would be a big cost on
 
02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants and
 
02:55:09.190 --> 02:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
i think what you'd see is the
 
02:55:11.190 --> 02:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
corresponding move to
 
02:55:14.309 --> 02:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know reduce shifts reduce hours
 
02:55:17.429 --> 02:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
and use technology whenever possible to
 
02:55:17.439 --> 02:55:18.630 align:start position:0%
and use technology whenever possible to
replace

02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
replace
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
um wait staff and and you know we've
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
certainly seen that
 
02:55:26.070 --> 02:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
in areas of the country that have um
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
raised the minimum wage significantly
 
02:55:30.150 --> 02:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
some people have been helped
 
02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
no question about it if you're somebody
 
02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:33.910 align:start position:0%
no question about it if you're somebody
that

02:55:33.910 --> 02:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know has a job and your wage has
 
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
02:55:40.790 --> 02:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
as a result of the change in law more
 
02:55:43.429 --> 02:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
power to you but if you're somebody who
 
02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
has lost their job because they've been
 
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
priced out of the market or you're a
 
02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:49.590 align:start position:0%
priced out of the market or you're a
first-time

02:55:49.590 --> 02:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
first-time
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
job seeker that is suddenly priced out
 
02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
of the market
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're losers too and i think
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's always been my concern with
 
02:56:00.550 --> 02:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage
 
02:56:02.710 --> 02:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
i mean as as i think we all know right
 
02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:03.670 align:start position:0%
i mean as as i think we all know right
now

02:56:03.670 --> 02:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:56:08.070 --> 02:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
um there are thousands of jobs
 
02:56:10.230 --> 02:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
um available in new hampshire and so
 
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
anybody that wants to work
 
02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
can work but restaurants are under
 
02:56:17.590 --> 02:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
undue pressure because of the pandemic
 
02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:18.309 align:start position:0%
undue pressure because of the pandemic
that

02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
is going to be with us i think for quite
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
some time
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
and the potential of this burden on
 
02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:25.670 align:start position:0%
and the potential of this burden on
restaurants

02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
02:56:28.630 --> 02:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
i think when you hear their testimony i
 
02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
hope you feel compelled as we were in
 
02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
02:56:36.550 --> 02:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
knowing that you know lions 19 and 20
 
02:56:39.910 --> 02:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
the contingency language nothing changes
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
unless the minimum wage increases in
 
02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.710 align:start position:0%
unless the minimum wage increases in
washington

02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you senator so this is will
 
02:56:53.190 --> 02:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
infant time uh i was reading the senate
 
02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
infant time uh i was reading the senate
testimony

02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:56:55.990 --> 02:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
are we the only state in new england
 
02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
that has a
 
02:56:59.590 --> 02:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
tipped wage that has a percentage of the
 
02:57:00.790 --> 02:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
the minimum
 
02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
i i'm not certain of that but i believe
 
02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
that to be the case
 
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative adagent you
 
02:57:09.750 --> 02:57:09.760 align:start position:0%

02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator for taking the
 
02:57:12.790 --> 02:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
question um as
 
02:57:14.230 --> 02:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
was pointed out correctly by
 
02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:15.910 align:start position:0%
was pointed out correctly by
representatives

02:57:15.910 --> 02:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:57:19.030 --> 02:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
out there uh regarding turnover
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
and uh savings from that in the
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry in fact
 
02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
one that i'm going to i'm going to stop
 
02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
02:57:28.230 --> 02:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
please i'd like to have a lot of
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
latitude on this representative over the
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
last couple of weeks
 
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
please ask a question instead of making
 
02:57:35.030 --> 02:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
making your point
 
02:57:36.550 --> 02:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
of what you want to get in there and
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
then asking the question off that please
 
02:57:41.190 --> 02:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe that there are
 
02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
robust studies of employment
 
02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
in restaurants regarding minimum wage
 
02:57:47.349 --> 02:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
increases then they suggest that wage
 
02:57:49.269 --> 02:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
increases get absorbed by
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
price increases that do not impact point
 
02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:57.190 --> 02:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
this was specifically brought up by the
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
clerk of the house
 
02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
that the use of would you believes
 
02:58:04.389 --> 02:58:04.399 align:start position:0%
are not appropriate in hearings the
 
02:58:06.230 --> 02:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of hearings
 
02:58:08.710 --> 02:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
are to receive testimony and ask
 
02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:09.590 align:start position:0%

questions

02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
of that testimony what you believe is
 
02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
making a comment made in the statement
 
02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
to the individual
 
02:58:18.150 --> 02:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
that the individual wants to get out
 
02:58:19.510 --> 02:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
there this is
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
this the the line that uh representative
 
02:58:23.590 --> 02:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
adjutant has taken
 
02:58:26.309 --> 02:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
is not appropriate for this senate
 
02:58:26.319 --> 02:58:26.950 align:start position:0%
is not appropriate for this senate
understood

02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
understood
 
02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you that was what was presented by
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
the clerk please ask your question
 
02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
but definitely please okay i was not
 
02:58:34.550 --> 02:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
aware of that
 
02:58:38.150 --> 02:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
so i'll take that into consideration um
 
02:58:39.349 --> 02:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
i want you to ask your question
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative i just want you to do it
 
02:58:43.670 --> 02:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
in a way that's
 
02:58:47.590 --> 02:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
acceptable thank you senator bradley
 
02:58:51.349 --> 02:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:54.950 --> 02:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
that there might be a difference
 
02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
between what is most beneficial
 
02:59:00.630 --> 02:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of a restaurant
 
02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:02.230 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of a restaurant
worker

02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
worker
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
well i think as i've tried to answer
 
02:59:11.990 --> 02:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
this question
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage creates winners and
 
02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:15.910 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage creates winners and
losers

02:59:15.910 --> 02:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
losers
 
02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
and if your wage goes up you're clearly
 
02:59:20.790 --> 02:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
a winner
 
02:59:23.110 --> 02:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
but if you've lost your job due to
 
02:59:23.120 --> 02:59:24.870 align:start position:0%
but if you've lost your job due to
technology

02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
or less hours or fewer shifts
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
because the cost to the restaurant owner
 
02:59:33.670 --> 02:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
that creates losers too
 
02:59:37.750 --> 02:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
and so i've always been very concerned
 
02:59:40.150 --> 02:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
that raising the minimum wage and while
 
02:59:42.070 --> 02:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
this is a subset of it
 
02:59:44.309 --> 02:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
does create winners and losers and in
 
02:59:44.319 --> 02:59:45.990 align:start position:0%
does create winners and losers and in
particular

02:59:45.990 --> 02:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:59:48.710 --> 02:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
and restaurants are really good at
 
02:59:48.720 --> 02:59:49.349 align:start position:0%
and restaurants are really good at
hiring

02:59:49.349 --> 02:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
first-time job seekers
 
02:59:55.990 --> 02:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
i mean that that is a staple for many
 
02:59:59.110 --> 02:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants and they are
 
03:00:03.110 --> 03:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
often at tipped wages and
 
03:00:06.309 --> 03:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
if they're unable to hire as many people
 
03:00:08.830 --> 03:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
then people lose too and that's my
 
03:00:08.840 --> 03:00:12.630 align:start position:0%
then people lose too and that's my
concern

03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you one more question
 
03:00:15.439 --> 03:00:16.870 align:start position:0%
thank you one more question
representative

03:00:16.870 --> 03:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:00:19.910 --> 03:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh senator this is
 
03:00:19.920 --> 03:00:20.710 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh senator this is
just

03:00:20.710 --> 03:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear on on
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
state and federal it's my understanding
 
03:00:31.110 --> 03:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire defers basically to
 
03:00:31.830 --> 03:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
minimum wage as we don't have a statute
 
03:00:36.070 --> 03:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
defining the federal
 
03:00:41.349 --> 03:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
bill there are there is a number
 
03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:44.870 align:start position:0%
bill there are there is a number
proposed

03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a percentage which
 
03:00:48.870 --> 03:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
effectively would freeze
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
that minimum wage my question is is how
 
03:00:53.990 --> 03:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
does that play out
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
um can the state of new hampshire
 
03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:57.590 align:start position:0%
um can the state of new hampshire
supersede

03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
supersede
 
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
federal or can or does federal supersede
 
03:01:04.469 --> 03:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
state well i think i
 
03:01:07.830 --> 03:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
answered that if the feds raised the
 
03:01:10.070 --> 03:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
tipped minimum wage
 
03:01:13.110 --> 03:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
then this debate is over but
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
in the past my understanding
 
03:01:15.279 --> 03:01:16.309 align:start position:0%
in the past my understanding
representative

03:01:16.309 --> 03:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
is congress has raised the minimum
 
03:01:23.429 --> 03:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
wage without raising the tipped wage so
 
03:01:25.910 --> 03:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
this bill only applies to that
 
03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:27.269 align:start position:0%
this bill only applies to that
circumstance

03:01:27.269 --> 03:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
03:01:30.550 --> 03:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
where congress were to raise the minimum
 
03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:31.269 align:start position:0%
where congress were to raise the minimum
wage

03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
wage
 
03:01:34.309 --> 03:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
and leave the tipped wage unadjusted but
 
03:01:36.309 --> 03:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
because of the 45
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
provision in new hampshire law then
 
03:01:43.670 --> 03:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
our minimum wage in that eventuality
 
03:01:45.910 --> 03:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
would more than double if the feds
 
03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
raised the tip minimum wage
 
03:01:52.710 --> 03:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
this debate is over they raised
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:02.150 --> 03:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
