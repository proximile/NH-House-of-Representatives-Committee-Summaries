00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
so good good afternoon uh members of the
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
Mike whims I serve as director of the
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
waste management division for New
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees and I'm joined today by
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh Leah McKenna who's administrator of
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
our Solid Waste Management Bureau and we
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
do have uh a few things we'd like to
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
present to you that I think will be
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
responsive to the questions that you
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
asked represent of kraton and I want to
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Leah at this time to uh
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
talk about kind of where we're at in the
 
00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
in the process and talk a little bit
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
about that rule making the formal
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process perfect thank you
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
again leam McKenna and I am the chair
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
the administrator of a solid waste
 
00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
management Bureau uh so when we last met
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
in October as you may remember we had
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
just uh sent out um the actual language
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
the pros language that we were looking
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
at relative to en vsw 800 which is the
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
landfill requirements and we were
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
opening a uh an informal public input
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
3-week uh input session and that closed
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
around November 8th and so when we last
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
spoke uh we kind of outlined about a
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
dozen of those changes and um right now
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is uh in we're in
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
receipt mode so that that period closed
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
we received received comments from 14
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
entities so you know uh general public
 
00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh public interest groups industry and
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
Consultants um those
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
total page- wise about a 100 Pages some
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
of those pages are um we'll say we have
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
dozens of pages of actual comments that
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're that we're filtering through at
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
this time so what now what we're doing
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
right now is actively reviewing those
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
seeing what if you know what changes we
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
want to make based on all those comments
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
and um to answer your question
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative kraton on
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
timeline the formal rule making portion
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
starts when we present to the waste
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
management Council and I think as I I
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
think I mentioned in October but if I
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
didn't uh our goal is to present those
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
at their um the waste management
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
council's meeting on January 18th and so
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's what kind of starts the formal
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process in motion one of
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
those one of the portions of the formal
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
um rule making process is a formal
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing and direct whimet that we
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
we assume that's going to happen
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
sometime U March or April and with again
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
the goal to have these rules adopted in
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
effective uh on or before July 1 2024
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
expire so uh we wanted to address a
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
couple of the questions that uh that you
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
that you had both at the last meeting I
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
think you I think you kind of nailed the
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
two and so I'm going to turn it back
 
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
over to director whimet to address those
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thanks Leah and I
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
should also note that uh we're joined
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
here not at the table but here in the
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
gallery um Sarah uas Kern our
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
administrative or excuse me our
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the waste division
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
is is also here she and Leah presented
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the this committee last
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
time so we're all here and certainly
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
happy to answer your questions um the
 
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
one question that we were provided with
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
um relative to these rules was um we we
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
have in in the draft that was presented
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
to the public for comment um we had
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
established uh essentially amended the
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
rule regarding the the distance of a
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
landfill from a perennial surface water
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
from 200 feet to 500 ft and I believe
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
there was some I was not in attendance
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
but I believe there was some discussion
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
and and and and back and forth about
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
that last time and I've since received
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
some inquiries you know with some folks
 
00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
being concerned that is that an
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number is it just pulled out
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
of the air is it uh you know why is it
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
just a number and why isn't it some kind
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
of performance-based standard and I want
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about that because
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
I think that there may be some confusion
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
about that um one of the things I think
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
that was said and we we had a little bit
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
of of bad information last time is that
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
um that that 500 foot setback somehow
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
represented an average of the
 
00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
surrounding State specifications and
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's not actually true what what I
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
want to correct the record for that so
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
in fact um if we're looking at states
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
that establish a numerical setback
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
standard in feat um this would actually
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
be more conservative and more protect
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
than most other states it's or any of
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
the other neighboring New England states
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
in the sense that we think that as we
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
survey the rules of those States it
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
appears that they set they established
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
setbacks on the order of anywhere from
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
100 ranging up to 400 feet and of course
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're proposing 500 feet um so I think
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's that that I just want to make
 
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
sure we correct the record on that um
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
the second thing I want to say is that
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's not just a number and and um we
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
when we look at that number what we were
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
really trying to do do is we want to be
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
sure and there are already Provisions in
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
our rules and amendments to these rules
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
that make it very clear that when you
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
site your landfill it needs to be cited
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
in such a way relative to surface waters
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
nearby um that any release um can be
 
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
detected and investigated and remediated
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
prior to that surface water body being
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
adversely impacted by that release and
 
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:22.759 align:start position:0%
so we believe that extending from 200 to
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
500 ft just candidly gives you more
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
physical space in which in travel time
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
in which to evaluate a release and and
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
if needed um after investigation if
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
there is a need for remediation to
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
actually have a space to implement
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
remediation and and and address that
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
release so that it doesn't ad adversely
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
impact the surface water the the other
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
thing I want to mention is that um it
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
isn't just a number in the sense that um
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
if you look at other standards that we
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
have established already or will
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
establish in these rules basically a
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
rule that that states that the formation
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
the undisturbed soils beneath a landfill
 
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
can't can't have a a saturated hydraulic
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
conductivity of any more than 10us 3 cm/
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
second and that's a very commonly used
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh specification in
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
hydrogeology and um so if you were to
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
assume that you that any landfill that
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
would be cited would need to meet that
 
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
standard and if you assume that all the
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
soils from there to the surface water
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
body in question meet that same minimum
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
standard and then you also make
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
assumptions about average paracity and
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
the average gradient of the groundwater
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
table and you do a calculation on
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
groundwater velocity what you really
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
find is that represents about a
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
three-year travel time it roughly works
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
out to that and um you know there's been
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry slow down sure I'm sorry I'm
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
an artilleryman so just say that again
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
sure in other words okay I I'm happy to
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
do that now I did take hydrology in
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
college but that was before you were
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
born so you know some of those synapses
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
aren't firing real fast well I'm happy
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
to say there will be no quiz
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
but but um no I appreciate that and I in
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
in in more layman's terms if you if you
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
look at the equation that you used to
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
calculate groundwater velocity and you
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
make reasonable assumptions and you
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
assume that the formation the the soil
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
in the area beneath the landfill all the
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
way to the the surface water body meets
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
our minimum standards meaning that it's
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
no more it doesn't it doesn't transmit
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
water any faster than required than than
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
is the limit and you do the C that
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
calculation you learn that that 500 foot
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
setback equates to about a three-year
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
travel time
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
distance in what type of soil which so
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
that assumes a soil that is right at 10
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
Theus 3 cmers per second which for soil
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
type would be like a fine sand something
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
like that it's it's a so basically we're
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
establishing that as a minimum standard
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
for um you you can't what it's really
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
trying to say is you can't site a
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
landfill over soils that are you know
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
very porous highly conductive gravel
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
deposits or cobbles or anything like
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
that you're basically looking at finer
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
grain soils that impede the flow of
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater at you know more so than a
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
more conductive soil okay so I'm just if
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
you don't mind I'm just saying so what
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying is if the water in the
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
soil at the proposed site moves faster
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
than 10 to the minus three then that
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
site is disqualified that's right right
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's if it's slower than 10
 
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.630 align:start position:0%
that's that's if it's slower than 10
Theus

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
Theus
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
3 then it's it can proceed through the
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
process potentially eligible that's
 
00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:39.799 align:start position:0%
correct okay all right any okay go ahead
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I could say a little more
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
about that so so there's been a fair
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
amount of discussion in the legislature
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years about the
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
idea of a um of a of a standard that
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
sets a certain travel time and one of
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
the things that was in play in the last
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years was the idea of you know
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
Maine has a fiveyear travel time for
 
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.870 align:start position:0%
Maine has a fiveyear travel time for
example

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
and then they allow you to reduce that
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
travel time distance um by up to two
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
years to make it three years if you have
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
a double LED um system or if you do
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of monitoring and the fact
 
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
is that New Hampshire's design standards
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
for L already meet those more stringent
 
00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
standards so we already require if
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to site a a municipal Solid
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
Waste landfill in New Hampshire you have
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
to design it with a double liner you
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a choice of doing a single
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
liner so it's not like an a Beyond
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
compliance activity that's the minimum
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
that you need to meet so we actually
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
believe that what this proposed standard
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
would be with the 500 ft with our
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
current design standards and with our
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
other language that says youve got to be
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
able to to invest you know detect
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
investigate and remediate any release
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
before it impacts surface water we
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
believe that taken together those um
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
those standards will be among the most
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
protective in New England we think it's
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
an appropriate way having said that
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
we're still um uh evaluating comments
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
and take you know that that we've
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
received and we have not filed an
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
initial proposal yet um to put a finer
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
point on what Leah said the she's
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
absolutely right the first sort of
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
official rulemaking thing that we do is
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
to submit a draft initial proposal to
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
the waste management Council but what we
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
do following that and after we take any
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
input from the council is we then file
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
that initial proposal in the rulemaking
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
register and that launches the public
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
process essentially and then at that
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
point what we're directed to do we file
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact statement with that and
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
some other documents with the office of
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislative services and then we um
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me with the legislative budget
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
assistant and then at that point we um
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh schedule a public hearing and and um
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
that that is actually an in-person
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
public hearing where the Public's
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
invited to come and give oral testimony
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
in a live setting and then we typically
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
would open a public comment period
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
following that hearing um during which
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
time the public is invited to submit
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
written comments um on on the rule and
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
then once that comment period is closed
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
we take all those comments and review
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
them determine whether we think any uh
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
adjustments or amendments to the
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
proposed rule are are are warranted and
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
then we would proceed to draft a final
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
proposal which we then file with uh the
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
the o with OS and then that goes to
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
eventually to a meeting at the Joint
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
review um yes
 
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
review um yes
thank

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you all uh for joining us
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
today so I I just want to check in with
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that I heard and Then
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
followed that up with a question to make
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
sure that I I understand it correctly
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
sure so when when you were discussing
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
why the 500 foot setback is not simply a
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
number it's not an arbitrary distance
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
the first thing you explained was how
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
that distance was arrived at by looking
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
at some of the other states in the
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
region who use uh distance right for set
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
back and this gives us a more
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
conservative uh number within that range
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh and my initial reaction was that okay
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
well that's all in well and good but
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
that still doesn't tell me that there's
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
science behind that number it doesn't
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
make it a less arbitrary number without
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
knowing what the science is then you
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
explained given some of the average
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
travel time right uh that works out to
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
about three years uh travel time right
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
and so that to me is is compelling
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
because it that to me is a a an outcome
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
that is based on science right so my
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
question then is which is obviously
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
repeating a question I've asked before
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
why why don't we have the regulation in
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
travel time and not in distance because
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
distance is an arbitrary number unless
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
you then can explain it in terms of
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
travel time and that to me is the actual
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
determination for
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
distance that's terrific question thank
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
you repr of J and and actually the the
 
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
answer to it is that I think goes back
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
to some of our testimony from last year
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
in this past sou session and that is
 
00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:08.149 align:start position:0%
in this past sou session and that is
that

00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
um the ability to if you set if we set
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
for example say we said that you have to
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
be at least three years travel time
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
distance from any surface water body
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
that then it would be incumbent on the
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
applicant to gather enough hydrogeologic
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
data to demonstrate that which they
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
might be able to do in certain
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances in other circumstances
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
they might not they might not own all
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
the land or or you know that's between
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
them and the surface and every surface
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
water in all directions um they may not
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
be able to and once they do it what I've
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
said is that that that kind of
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
regulation in my view is a bit of a
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
regulator's nightmare and the reason I
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
say that is that as a regulator when you
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
have a standard you want to be clear
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
whether someone isn't complying with it
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
or not and you don't want it to be
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
subject to a lot of argument among
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
experts and I can tell you you that if
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
we set a standard that looked like that
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
I think we would end up in a place where
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
um we'd have the applicant articulating
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
that yes my my my my placement of my
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
landfill meets that setback and here's
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
the data to demonstrate why and we'd
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
have experts on the other side of the
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
issue submitting arguments why that's
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
not the right way to calculate it and
 
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
the reality is hydrog geology is is not
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
the same as um you know a lot of
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineering problems there's
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
a lot more uncertainty in terms of
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
formation things are very the systems
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
are very heterogeneous they don't they
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
don't always uh they aren't uniform
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
throughout the formation and so our
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
feeling is is that with a travel time
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
setback we would end up with um a lot of
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
times that issue being subject to appeal
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
which can sometimes take a couple years
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
to resolve um and then they become very
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
difficult for the courts to resolve them
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
because in the end they are technical
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
arguments not legal arguments and one
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
advantage of um a 500t setback
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
particularly when it's tied to the uh
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
the technical basis that I discussed is
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
that most people have a hard time
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
arguing about whether 500 feet is 500
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
feet it's pretty clear standard um and
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
so we believe that that setting a number
 
00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
like that a distance like that uses the
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
technical protections that we want to
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
see but makes it much easier to
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
implement much more effective and and um
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
and easier to enforce and that's why we
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
believe that's a superior approach to
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
this than doing what you
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
suggested representative BBY yeah so um
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that that 500 foot setback
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
is also combined with a requirement for
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh a maximum U paracity of the soil uh
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
and conductivity of the soil so that the
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh so that anything that uh is more more
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
porous or more conductive would make the
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
site ineligible is that correct yeah and
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
understand that 10 the minus 3 standard
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
applies to the formation underlying the
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
footprint of the landfill okay and so
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
how far out from the
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
borders uh from the landfill border does
 
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.630 align:start position:0%
borders uh from the landfill border does
that

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
extend it's basically the footprint of
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
the landfill including really
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
essentially the liner system and the BM
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
that that that anchors the liner okay so
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
if the the area that is directly under
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
the landfill and the liner Etc meets
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
those standards but the area immediately
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
outside it is more porous uh would there
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
be a risk of uh of problems with lee8
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
spills when the lee8 was
 
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
transported certainly that if if the
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
area outside the landfill footprint is
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
more porous then then contaminants and
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
groundwater will travel faster than it
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
would if it were less porous
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
um we we again if you take these in
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
concert with all the requirements we do
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
have a requirement that says as I
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that you need to it
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be cited and the hydrogeology
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
in the study of hydrogeology of the site
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
needs to support that a release would be
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
able to be investigated detected
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
investigated and remediated prior to
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
adversely impacting a surface water and
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
that that provision is still in there
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
and effective and operative regardless
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
of what um you know other conditions
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
might be present or not present okay so
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh if the if the soil outside the
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
perimeter of the actual landfill
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
footprint which is but was what but is
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
still within the property limits of the
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
landfill owner if that
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
is uh how would
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
you uh judge whether the uh a landfill
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
met the requirement to to be able to uh
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
detect uh and remediate within the uh
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
within that time frame without having
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
some more data about what the uh the
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
soil is like between the landfill
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
perimeter and the surface water
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
body typically we're we're going to have
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
more information certainly than just the
 
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
the footprint of the landfill in terms
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
of soil type and and and aquifer
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
characteristics so our hydrogeologists
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
would look at that information and make
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
a judgment call as to whether it meets
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
that standard the standard being being
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
able to detect remed investigate and
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair so another
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
question I had and I apologize I had the
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
U I printed out the the Draft rules and
 
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
I'd written all these great notes and of
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
course it must be in a different folder
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
binder uh so I can't reference the
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
specific um section that I have in mind
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
but but um in in one area of the Draft
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
rules which provides for extra
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
protections and I forget you know if
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's around schools hospitals I forget
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
right so uh my recollection is this is a
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
thousand foot buffer 500 feet of which
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
has to be vegetated right there has to
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
be vegetation and so what I'm wondering
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
is why that is not just a good rule for
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
going to go by feet I understand um some
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
of the the things you you you pointed
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
out before about the complexities of of
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
using a simple uh simple in quotes uh
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
travel time but so if we're going to use
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
distance why is a th000 foot with 500
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
feet being vegetated which occurs
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in rules why is that not a
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
good standard for uh any body of water
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
or surface water sure I I think because
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's apples and oranges what we're
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
trying to effectuate with um uh distance
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
from those sensitive receptors that you
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
describe schools and nursing homes and
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing is not about
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
contaminant transport in groundwater in
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
the subsurface it's about noise and odor
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
and um vectors and that sort of thing so
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's two different it's trying to
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
establish a distance of setback that are
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
protections yeah I'm I'm G to go back to
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
your 500 foot thing because you said
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
something then said something else you
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
had mentioned in your initial opening
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
remarks regarding
 
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
the 500 foot also adding to the
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
distance of visible area where you can
 
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
distance of visible area where you can
identify

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
leakage um
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
and and but that's not the primary
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of the 500 the primary Pur 500
 
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.029 align:start position:0%
purpose of the 500 the primary Pur 500
is

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
still the setback right or is it for
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
identification it well the the the whole
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
purpose of having a setback from surface
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
water is recognizing that um releases
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
can occur you know you could have a in
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario you could have a
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
liner failure and you could have
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
leachate getting out of the liner and
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
getting into the formation um or you
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
could have leech eight releases um
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
because lee8 is handled routinely at
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
landfills it's it's designed to collect
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
leachate put it into a tank and then
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
pump that off and what typically happens
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
at most landfills is that that that the
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
truck comes and the tank is pumped off
 
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
to a tanker truck and the tanker truck
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
leaves the site and goes to a wastewater
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
treatment plant to discharge that for
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
treatment um so releases can and do and
 
00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
have happened in that scen in that
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
scenario so the idea of the setback from
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
surface waters is in the event that you
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
have a release particularly one that is
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
is not visible so it's a it's a liner
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
leak or it's some kind of a a a leate
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
collection Plumbing problem that isn't
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
obvious when it it doesn't it's not like
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
you had a spill and you observed it so
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
the idea is that you want to have enough
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
distance so that your regular monitoring
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
systems like we have ground monitoring
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
wells around landfills that are intended
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
to identify releases of contaminants to
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
the formation and to the groundwater so
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
that once you have that data you would
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
still have time to react to it
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
investigate it and identify the problem
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's not ongoing and fix it
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
if it is and then if there is a
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
sufficient release that you think that
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
it might threaten groundwater quality
 
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
down gradient or the surface water to
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
give you time to complete an
 
00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
investigation of that and develop if
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
necessary Implement an actual active
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
remediation which might include pumping
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
and treating the groundwater or treating
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
the groundwater in situ in some way so
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
that you reduce the contaminants so that
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have an adverse impact on the
 
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
surface water and the idea being that we
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
felt you know on on inspection you know
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're looking at all of our rules now
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
after many years and saying we're not
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
sure 200 feet is enough to is is as much
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
as we'd like to have in order to
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish that now it needs to be said
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
we we don't actually have record other
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
than for our unline landfills which is
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
another matter
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
for the for the line systems that we
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
currently are are regulating that manage
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
our waste um the double line you know
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
system our landfills that have Lee
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
collection we don't have a history here
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
of surface waters being adversely
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
impacted by those landfills um but
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
having said that um we want to be as as
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
protective as we can be within reason
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
and uh we think that expanding that 200
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
to 500 feet gives us more travel time
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
and more frankly just physical distance
 
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:28.839 align:start position:0%
in which to make an evaluation and then
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
Implement a remedy if that's needed so
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
and I am on the there's a ongoing
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
discussion right now on the leakage into
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
the aminos right how does that relate to
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
the lining that you just sure no I'm
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
glad you asked the question because I
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
know it's on a lot of people's minds and
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
actually we will later this week be
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
releasing a letter that explains the
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
agency's position on that that's a
 
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
complex matter that's that the you're
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
making reference to the ncees landfill
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
in Bethlehem at the northeast corner of
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
the landfill where there's a lot of
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
history that that that the the S has
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
been expanded there but prior to um the
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
19 early 1990s there was an unline
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
landfill at that site that was operated
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
by others not the current owners and
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
that had some significant adverse
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
impacts on um the groundwater in that
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
area I'm not sure there are documented
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
impacts to the amusic river itself even
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
from that facility but there certainly
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
were adverse imp acts on groundwater
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
quality around that landfill and back in
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
the early 1990s when NC was looking to
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
expand that landfill and construct a
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
line system there they um agreed to
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
basically pick up that entire unlined
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
landfill all the waste in that online
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
landfill and place it into a line system
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
on the same site now when you do that
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
you you have a great impact it
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely improves things because now
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
you no longer have that waste that is
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
that where the release of contaminant
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
that waste are not impeded by anything
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
because there's no liner you now put it
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
in a line system where you can collect
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
the lee8 and properly manage it um but
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
you can't undo what's been done to the
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
soil and the formation and the and the
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
groundwater at the site so um we've been
 
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:14.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring uh we have a system whenever
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
we have a site whether it's a landfill
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
or some hazardous way site we have a a
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism called a groundwater
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
management permit which is issued for
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
the site which requires that a network
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
of groundwater monitoring Wells be
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
regularly monitored and um evaluated to
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
to sort of make sure that the remedy in
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
this case picking up the landfill and
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
putting it in a line system has has been
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
effective at reducing contamination and
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
restoring groundwater in the area and so
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
we've had a groundwater management
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
permit for that landfill um for many
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
years and uh we continue to monitor it
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
it it has had impacts there's no
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
question most of the impacts were
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
related to what we call Vol organic
 
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
compounds or voc's um which were in much
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
greater concentration many years ago
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
most of those have declined as we would
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
expect because we picked up the landfill
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
um over time and and either gone to very
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
low or non-detect concentrations there
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
are two contaminants however that we
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
tend to see persisting at those kinds of
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
sites one of them is 14 dioxine which is
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
something we've known about for a number
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
of years but we have more more recently
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
established a much lower standard
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
drinking water standard for it it is um
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
actually a compound that was used
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
commonly as a stabilizer for chlorine
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
ated solvents it was also used in
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
household products um or at least it was
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
there present as a contaminant in
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
household products and it's very
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
persistent it does not break down like
 
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
most other voc's so we do tend to see
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
one for oxine lingering in the
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
groundwater environment much longer than
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
the other voc's and that has been the
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
case here although even that has been
 
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
declining um and then the other one is a
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
much newer contaminant for us and that's
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
something everybody's heard of past and
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
so the the the the issue with past is
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
that they're also extremely persistent
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
they do not break down readily in the
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater environment but they also
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
are regulated at extremely low
 
00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
concentrations where we regulate almost
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
all the voc's that we regulate in the
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
parts per billion range or micrograms
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
per liter we regulate pasas and you know
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
for pfoa for example at 12 parts per
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
trillion which is nanograms per liter
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
which is three orders of magnitude lower
 
00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
so we tend to see pasas at virtually
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
every landfill in New Hampshire um all
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
the unline land almost all the unline
 
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
landfills have it as present as a
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
contaminant even those that long since
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
saw their vocc concentrations go away um
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
and we do see it at our line systems as
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
well and in many cases that is um uh
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
attributed to um not necessarily a leak
 
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
in the liner but um releases of leech
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
because it's in leech eight when you
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
have a release of leech eight at a site
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
you you will get some and just candidly
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
I mean trucks you know driving in and
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
tipping their waste um p is so prevalent
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
in our environment that there are a lot
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
of ways that P can get into the
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
groundwater at a waste facility now what
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in the amusic or excuse me
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
in in that part of the landfill is that
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
um we see not surprisingly
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
concentrations of pasas um in
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
groundwater that we believe are
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
associated with the former unline
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
landfill um there are other monitoring
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
Wells where we believe there may be past
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
as a result of former known and
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
responded to releases of leech eight
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
during leech eight handling and we've
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
asked actually for additional work at
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
those around those Wells to evaluate
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
that um one of the things that's been
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
alleged is that there there as I said
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated area of the site at
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
this northeast part of the landfill
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
there's also a series of groundwater
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
seeps and a groundwater seep as you know
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
most of us have seen this somewhere you
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
see groundwater just emanating from the
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
edge of a of a slope or something like
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
that it's just an expression of the
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater table in many cases coming
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
out at when you have a change of
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
topography it comes out on the landfill
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
or excuse me on the uh on the face of
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
the of the soil in this case we have a
 
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
what we call the main seed which is not
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
very subtle it's about I think it's been
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
estimated at more more than 60 gallons a
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
minute many times depending on the time
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the year so it's a significant
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
discharge of groundwater on the surface
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
of the ground it forms a channel and
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
then that channel conveys that water to
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
the AMC River and um the one of the
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunate situations is that probably
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
as a result of geochemical conditions
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
that were caused by the unline
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
landfill but also just the actual
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
geologic conditions there um this the
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
the water that comes out of that seep is
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
very iron rich and when it it's it's
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
full of dissolved iron and when it hits
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
the oxidizing conditions of the air air
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
in in the open air a lot of that um o
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
iron gets oxidized and becomes insoluble
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
in that water so it precipitates out and
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
any of us who have wandered about have
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
seen this um if you ever come across uh
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
groundw or water on the ground or in a
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
pond or or even just coming out of a
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
Culver you'll see where it discharges
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
just um this gross sort of looking Rusty
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
colored film and that's the result of
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
iron bacteria that that that process
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
that it's a proc precipitated iron and
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
then the iron bacteria will sometimes
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
have waste products that almost look
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
like a petroleum machine um but it's not
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
actually petroleum so it's got that
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
rainbow Sheen um and we we respond to
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
dozens of complaints about this every
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
year all across the state often from
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
just purely naturally occurring
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
conditions but anyways at the seep it's
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
happened in Spades it's really quite
 
00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:51.079 align:start position:0%
disgusting looking and noticeable it
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
caused a lot of concern on the on the
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
part of the public and we actually um
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
entered into agreement with um NCS many
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
years ago to remediate the seep in which
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
they basically took all that whole area
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
where the channel where the seep
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
discharges and then it goes down to the
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
river and we had them pull it all up
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
because it looked terrible and then line
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
it with rocks and and basically try to
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
make it look better it didn't work very
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
well because the water coming out of
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
that seep was still loaded with iron and
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
So within a few weeks or months it
 
00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:23.559 align:start position:0%
looked kind of the same as it did before
 
00:42:23.559 --> 00:42:24.309 align:start position:0%
looked kind of the same as it did before
but

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
iron as opposed to P right natur I
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm getting there I'm just
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
trying to give you some context so this
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
is an area that's been of great interest
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people because it looks
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
pretty ugly there are other seeps that
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
aren't quite as substantial as the main
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
seep we have required and CES to monitor
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
the groundwater qu or the water quality
 
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:47.559 align:start position:0%
in those seeps um over time and we we
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
basically the most recent sampling um we
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't see voccs in them but they but we
 
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
did detect um in a couple of the seeps
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
not the main seat but in a couple of the
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
seeps um low concentrations in the parts
 
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
per trillion range of pasas and it's
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
been alleged that that somehow has
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
contaminated the amusic river during
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
that same monitoring period we also took
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
samples from the amusic channel in the
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
river channel in the river water um in
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
three locations near that those
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
discharges and we do not detect Pas in
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
any of those samples so what I want to
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
make clear is that we don't believe that
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
the amusic river is being adversely
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
impacted by the discharges that are
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
associated with those seeps and the
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
seeps um essentially you can't stop them
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to run the water's going
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
to go there um we continue to monitor
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
them and and we'll do that into the
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
future but we don't have reason to
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
believe so the the data that we obtained
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
from the seeps did not surprise us
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
because those seeps represent
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality and we already knew
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
we had past in groundwater there and so
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a surprise that some of those
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
seeps have detectable levels of of um
 
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
pasas in them but they're not at a
 
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
concentration that we believe is having
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
any adverse impact on the quality of the
 
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
river repr B yeah so does the uh I
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
assume that it's some sort of an aquafer
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
that leads to the seep from uh where
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the sour source of the
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
groundwater is does that aquifer run
 
00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
under the landfill or is it adjacent to
 
00:44:27.319 --> 00:44:28.510 align:start position:0%
under the landfill or is it adjacent to
the

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
landfill it it does run under it in the
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
sense that when the when the unlined
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
landfill was um removed and placed in a
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
line system a line system was
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
subsequently placed over the footprint
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
of that former unline landfill so
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's a line portion of the landfill
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
that overlies certainly at least some of
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
the groundw that contributes to probably
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
groundwater that contributes to the
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
discharges in the
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.349 align:start position:0%
discharges in the
seat

00:44:58.349 --> 00:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
and so you're going to you're providing
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
a response paper there will be a letter
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
response coming later this week that's
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
correct okay and any other
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you dig just is another
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
one of those um you know uh make sure
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
that I I heard you correctly and I
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
understand the explanation so the the
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
way I POS this question in my mind is
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know what would a leak look like
 
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
right as opposed to what you're seeing
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
right so what I'm hearing is that what
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
you're seeing is consistent with typical
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality levels of of of the
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
things you're testing for as opposed to
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
what what would a leak look like
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
qualitatively right that that makes you
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
feel confident that that is not what is
 
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559 align:start position:0%
happening here sure thanks for the
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
question so first of all I would say you
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
know having past and one for oxine At
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
Any concentration of water I wouldn't I
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
hope we don't get to a place where we
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
say that's a normal level because we we
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
certainly have groundwater in the state
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
where we don't detect past and that's
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
the way we want it so but in terms of
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
the conditions in the history of the
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
site where it housed an online landfill
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't surprise us that we're seeing
 
00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
those concentrations so I want to be
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
clear about that but it's a great
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
question so what would you know if we if
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
we were concerned that there were a
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
liner leak what would the groundwater
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
data be that would lead us to that
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
conclusion and um the answer is that um
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
there are a number of geochemical
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
parameters and vult organic compounds um
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
that we would see significant changes in
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
so um there are voc's in lee8 and there
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
are um you know leate is is very
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
relatively strong um solution it's got a
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
lot of contaminants in it from the
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
landfill so when if we had a liner leak
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
there where the leachate was actually
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
leaking we would expect to see um you
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
know chlorides we'd accept to see
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
increases in certain geochemical
 
00:46:56.829 --> 00:46:56.839 align:start position:0%
parameters oxidizing condition um pH but
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
also the presence of Al organic
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
compounds that shouldn't be in
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
groundwater anywhere that would be part
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
of lee8 and when we when we have seen
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
leachate releases before we don't have a
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
situation where we had a liner leak that
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
we're aware of but when we've seen
 
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:12.559 align:start position:0%
leachate releases as a result of a um
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
mistake in pumping off a tank or
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
something like that in a in an accident
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
um we tend to see the impacts from that
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
tend to include not just pasts or4
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
dioxane but um voc's those other
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
geochemical parameters and that's not
 
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:29.559 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in the groundwater
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
data or the seep data that we've
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
collected most
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
recently so what you're seeing looks
 
00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:38.069 align:start position:0%
recently so what you're seeing looks
like

00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:47:38.079 --> 00:47:40.230 align:start position:0%
like
residual

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
residual
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
old um stuff that was left over from the
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
previous one not what you would normally
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
see in a active landfill right primarily
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
we believe we're looking at effects of
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
the old online landfill we do have some
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
concerns that um you know folks are
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
aware that there was a lee8 release um
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
that occurred not from a liner leak but
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
from a an accident with a with a with a
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
mechanical failure um we've been
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
investigating that we think that the
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
effects of that were largely mitigated
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
by what was done in the days immediately
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
following the release but um we do have
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
some concerns that we're following up on
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
and this is something that's always
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
ongoing in every landfill where we we
 
00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
see some data we have some concerns
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
about it and we ask for further hydrog
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
ological work to assess it and in fact
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
we responded to um that most most recent
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
submittals from the company that I've
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
been talking about the data they
 
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
collected with a letter that was dated
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
November 7th which laid out some
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
additional work that we'd like the
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
company to do to evaluate um some of the
 
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
um data that we're seeing in a couple of
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
those Wells so there's still more work
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
going on but nothing we've seen suggests
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
that we have a failure of the liner
 
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
questions you got every word of
 
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.789 align:start position:0%
questions you got every word of
it

00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
um okay so based on the 18
 
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.430 align:start position:0%
um okay so based on the 18
January

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
meeting uh when would you recommend that
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
we have our next discussion on rules
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
before or after that meeting well I I
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
mean I think probably after we and again
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
I want to say we're going to do our
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
level best to get those ready for a
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
review or for your presentation to the
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
waste management Council on the 18th of
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
January we've got legal review we got to
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
complete the rules draft we've got to
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
get legal review completed and you know
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
we got a lot we have a lot of moving
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
parts right now we have many chapters so
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
um we're going to do our very best to do
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
that if we stay on that schedule um then
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
you know at that point the the whole
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
process becomes it's been pretty public
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
already but it becomes very public at
 
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
that point the the the the draft is
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
published in the room making register it
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
goes out to a hearing and public comment
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
and then really um everything that
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
happens in there will be evident to
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
anybody who's looking on but we're
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to come and uh provide
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
an update to this subcommittee whenever
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
it uh whenever it pleases you um I mean
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll we'll be in the session
 
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
at that point so we'll be here pretty
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
frequently on other bills and uh if it
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh would be helpful and you want to SK
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
certainly it's your pleasure if you want
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
to schedule an update we'd be happy to
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh accommodate okay representative
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
victory yeah so I have a question that
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
um it it's uh doesn't have to do with
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
the spill it's uh just in terms of
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
whether something is dealt within the
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
rules at all or not um and whether it's
 
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
something that would could be dealt with
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
Justin rules or whether it would require
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
more legislation so uh I'm um I was uh
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
told that um TurnKey in Rochester does a
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
certain amount of pre-treatment of the
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
lee8 before they send it off to
 
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
municipal waste plants and that is a and
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that step reduces the amount of uh
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
pasas and other contaminants that end up
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
going into the municipal uh waste
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
processing which would then not
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
potentially end up in the bio sols uh
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if there is any uh
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
any place in the rules that uh uh does
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
or could require that sort of
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment at all
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
landfills there's nothing in the rules
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
that requires the landfill to pre-treat
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
their leech a on site there are rules
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
that make it very clear that a landfill
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
has to have at least two um identified
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
facilities that can accept all of their
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
leech eight um the idea being that you
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
know leech eight keeps coming whether
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
you want it or not you got to be able to
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
collect it and get it shipped off site
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
for for proper treatment um every day
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
basically so it's an important you know
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
institutional thing for a landfill to
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
have established that they've got an
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
outlet for their um for their leech a
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
and if for some reason one of those
 
00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:05.799 align:start position:0%
Outlets you know a wastewater treatment
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
L goes down for a week they need to have
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
another facility where they can bring
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
the Lee a to while they wait for that
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
one to come back online in the case of
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
TurnKey that the story behind that as I
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
understand it and certainly the company
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
officials could give you probably a more
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
accurate view but my understanding is
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%
that they were um you know it's a big
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
landfill generates a lot of leech a and
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
they have a number of places where they
 
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
send their leech eight one of which is
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
just to the local Rochester wastewater
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
treatment plant and it turned out that
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
as I understand Rochester had a UV um uh
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
disinfection equipment for their final
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
treatment of their their treated
 
00:52:44.589 --> 00:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
effluent before they discharged to the
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
river at the plant site um and there was
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
something in the lee8 from turny
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
landfill that was blinding that in a way
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't becoming effective for
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
disinfection so the city of Rochester
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
asked them to pre-treat their leachate
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
to remove that compound to make sure
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't frustrate their
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
treatment and disinfection processes so
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
they did that many years ago so that the
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
leachate that they sent to Rochester
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant would be
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable and it wouldn't cause the
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
Rochester plant to violate any of its uh
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
permits um in the meantime um so they
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
have a pretty sophisticated Wastewater
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
sophisticated wastewater treatment plant
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
at TurnKey um and if you're Ted it's
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's pretty impressive there's quite a
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
lot of infrastructure there to
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish that um as it turns out um
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
they do a step called reverse osmosis on
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
the tail end of that there's a variety
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
of treatment processes that they subject
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
the leech a to but on the final
 
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
polishing they actually um submit it to
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
reverse osmosis turns out reverse
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
osmosis is a really good method for
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
treating pasas and so when they were
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
implementing that regular treatment it
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
was really pulling out a lot of the pas
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
now it's not perfect because it means
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't destroy it it just it it
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
it concentrates it if you will into
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
What's called the reject a reverse
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
osmosis water treatment terms and then
 
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
they have to find a place to take that
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
right so there's um a lot of stories
 
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
about how that unfolded and so long
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
story short TurnKey is doing that there
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
are other landfills around the country
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
that are looking at this um I think that
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
um what's happening so far is that to
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
the extent that landfills are choosing
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
to pre treat on site in some cases
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
around the country it's because the
 
00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants where they
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
bring their leech heate have asked them
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
to do so it's not something that's
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
required in Most states rules and it's
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
not required in our rules it's something
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
I think we can we will we are looking at
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
and we probably should look at in the
 
00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
future I do want to point out that it's
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
a double-edged sword because one
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of collecting Lee at a
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
Landfield site putting it in a truck and
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
getting it off the site is that you you
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
minimize the handling of it basically
 
00:54:59.470 --> 00:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
goes it gets collected it goes to a tank
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
you off offload that to a tank truck and
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
off it goes if you build infrastructure
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
on the site you have the added concern
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
well what if you have a release from
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
your treatment infrastructure so I I
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
haven't really kind of figured out where
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
we ought to be on it to be honest with
 
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
you it's something that I think is you
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
know different people could could
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable people could take opposing
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
views on something like that about
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
whether that's the right thing to do or
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
not and I think that you know as time
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
goes on we'll learn more about it and I
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
think that you know it may the market
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
may drive it even if we didn't drive it
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
through a regulatory Direction because
 
00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants may find
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
themselves in a place where they don't
 
00:55:41.069 --> 00:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
want leachate that has pasas in it and
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
they may ask for pre-treatment there's
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
also been discussion about the idea of a
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
a regional pre-treatment facility that
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
would be separate from a landfill site
 
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
but would be constructed um primarily to
 
00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
take lee8 from landfills and and
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
pre-treat it and either do a full
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
treatment there and discharge it or
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
pre-treat it in some fashion and then
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
ship it to um other wastewater treatment
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
plants for further treatment and
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
discharge so it's it's a complex
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
question but it's definitely something
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about right I guess one
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
of my concerns is uh since one one of
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns of this committee is
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
the presence of pasas in soils and uh
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
one of the Avenues for that is the is
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
spreading of biosolids and one of the um
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
avenues for contamination of biosolids
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
is uh the that leachate being processed
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
in uh water treatment plants and uh that
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to have a vicious cycle
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
of um of the past you know being brought
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
from the landfill to the water treatment
 
00:56:55.029 --> 00:56:55.039 align:start position:0%
plant and then having that contaminate
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
the the biosolid which then is spread on
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
land right now it's definitely a concern
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we're looking at
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
right now is what standards we should
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
set we did a lot of work on this over
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
the last couple years to determine what
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
standards we should establish for you
 
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
know maximum concentrations of pasas in
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
biosolids if you're going to if they're
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
destined for land application so that's
 
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
something that's still in process right
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
now um if we talk to the landfill
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
operators they believe that the that the
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
Lion Share of Pas that they get in their
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
leachate comes from the from the
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
disposal of Believe It or Not textiles
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
carpets and things like that that have
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
been treated with um with past
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
containing cleaners and and treatments
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
um and that they because they're they're
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
they represent you you have to look at
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
the mass balance too right you know when
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
it comes to um what goes into an mssw
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
landfill there's a lot of textiles that
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
go into one and so I'm not sure anybody
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
knows for sure but I think that they
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
the landfill operators suspect that
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's a major source of the p in their
 
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.349 align:start position:0%
that's a major source of the p in their
leech

00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
leech
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
eight there's definitely a movement of
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
foot to get P out of a lot of consumer
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
and Industrial and Commercial products
 
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:10.039 align:start position:0%
and as we make progress in that regard
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
the concentration of pasas in lee8
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
should go down but it's important to
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
keep in mind you know it's it's not
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to happen faster overnight
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
because the mssw in our landfills is old
 
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
and and it's you know and it's it's what
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
it is it's going to continue to generate
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
sure yep thank you out of curiosity what
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
where does the kind of concentrated
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
pasas when they remove it uh and then
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
you said that obviously still needs to
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
be disposed of it can't be destroyed but
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious where does that go it's
 
00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:46.839 align:start position:0%
a great question I think right now and I
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
I don't like to ever speak for the
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
company particularly when I don't know
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
the answer for sure but the last I heard
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
from company officials that was going to
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
another one of their their facilities in
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
New York state for further treatment and
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
Disposal um
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh at one point the reject date was
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
actually going down to a wastewater
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
treatment plant in Massachusetts for for
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
treatment and discharge which for
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
reasons you can imagine didn't didn't
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
sit very well once people understood
 
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
that and then they they started sending
 
00:59:17.789 --> 00:59:17.799 align:start position:0%
it out to a out of state to a facility
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
state we good good
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
all right well anything from the uh
 
00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
folks out in the hinderland
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
chair sorry when you were talking
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
about the Le being sent out to another
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
facility and they process it or whatever
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
is that what other states do as well how
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
do other states handle these um the Le
 
00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
shapes and and leape from landfills yeah
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that in virtually
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
every case leape from landfills is
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
offloaded oh I'm sorry my understanding
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
is that in all case virtually every case
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
um unless it's treated on site lee8 from
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
landfills is collected in tank trucks
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
and truck to um nearby or sometimes
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
distant um Municipal Wastewater plants
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
where it's treated and discharged and
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
and other states do those the same thing
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
that that's correct that's my
 
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.430 align:start position:0%
that that's correct that's my
understanding

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
okay so uh I I I do have one last
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
question from the work that you guys are
 
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of detail a lot of um
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
attention to detail uh what what do you
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
need from us at the legislature at this
 
01:00:44.119 --> 01:00:45.630 align:start position:0%
need from us at the legislature at this
point

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's anything in
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
particular I mean we we know we have a
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
job to do we've got our rules are are
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
due to be um updated by July 1 of 2024
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
and we're going to do our best to meet
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
those deadlines and uh really we just
 
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
need to keep our heads down and keep
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
working at it right now okay actually
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so along the same lines uh I had a
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
call from Senator Waters um and he was
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
going to talk with um commissioner Scott
 
01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:15.039 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what the result of his
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
conversation was but the question was
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
whether there was going to whether more
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
funding was needed in order to make uh
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
in in order to enable to finish this
 
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.829 align:start position:0%
in in order to enable to finish this
rules

01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
process well I I I think certainly this
 
01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
it has to be said this is a Monumental
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
effort we we you know having um
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
virtually all of our rules expire at the
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
same time is is not a great plan right
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
and what we want to do rules are in
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
effect for 10 years and so once you do
 
01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
them you sort of get into that um
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
routine but what we'd like to do very
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
likely over time with the ability of
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
time to think about it and plan for it
 
01:01:58.109 --> 01:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
is to start amending certain chapters on
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
the staggered schedule so we don't have
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden 20 chapters of the same
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
set of rules all come to at the same
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
time it's been a tremendous burden I
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
will tell you that um we have staff who
 
01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
are working really hard on it and I
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
can't be I can't tell you how thankful I
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
am that they're so dedicated and capable
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
um having said that you know now to to
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
to we're we're we're in the we're in the
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
home stretch here um we got a lot of
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
work to do an appropriation of money we
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be able to get someone
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
hired and trained to to help us in time
 
01:02:32.029 --> 01:02:32.039 align:start position:0%
if we' had that five years ago we'd
 
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
certainly make use of it right now I
 
01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
think it's no secret that our Solid
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
Waste program has been kind of uh sort
 
01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
of chronically underfunded for many many
 
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
years and resulted in a lot of lot of
 
01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
struggles um in terms of keeping up with
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
our workload and getting things done I'm
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
happy to say we we did we have seen an
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
influx of funding that has helped us um
 
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
you know higher St staff you know
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
recruiting staff and keeping staff is
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for everybody right now so
 
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
that is what it is but to the extent we
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
can maintain the staff that we have and
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
and get it you know get our work done I
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be okay there's a
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
lot of Demands being placed on us as an
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
agency with regard to solid waste that
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
maybe weren't a few years ago um so we
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
may need to look at that and having you
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
know more more Staffing um but for the
 
01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:21.559 align:start position:0%
time being in terms of dealing with this
 
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
immediate problem the rulemaking I don't
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
think add dist funding would be that
 
01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
helpful to us okay so so the I think he
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
was looking at uh using one of the bills
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
that had been retained by the Senate and
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think that um it sounds like the
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
really the appropriate place for this
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
would be the next bional budget I think
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's right and I and I will say you
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
know I certainly we could I'm not going
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
to tell you we got everything we need we
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
if we had you know another landfill uh
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
permit engineer and another compliance
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
inspector ctor um that would be really
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
helpful we did lose our our rulemaking
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
person um to illness uh for many many
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
months and that really hurt us that's
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
not something that you know an
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation or anything else can help
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
that's just bad luck and that's when you
 
01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:10.039 align:start position:0%
manage people that's what happens yeah
 
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
um but um you know certainly we'd be
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
happy to engage in that discussion in
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
the next bium for sure I appreciate the
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
question well thank you all for your
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
hard work and uh we will not bother you
