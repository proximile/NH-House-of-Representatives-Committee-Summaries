are attendees or listening in
 
00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start position:0%

trying to sign up or trying to get in
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
uh this is an exact session so there is
 
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
no particular reason why we would ever
 
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
invite anybody
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%

uh we're
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%

we're not really
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
taking any hearings but
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh having said that so don't any of you
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
try to raise your hand unless you have a
 
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
try to raise your hand unless you have a
really

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
burning problem
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
so otherwise we'll begin
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
and first up is senate bill 14.
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%

shipping business and i
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
health laws
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
that are involved with
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
that part of it and
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
service dogs versus companion dogs
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
so it still needs a lot of work in that
 
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.350 align:start position:0%
so it still needs a lot of work in that
piece

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
and the nano contract brewers piece of
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
already being addressed in sb 125
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
so i move that we retain it to work
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
on especially the dogs part of it
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh we do have conversation
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh so uh see whose hands up who's up
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
first representative bartlett
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair um
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna vote against retain i really
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
feel this
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
is an ipl um that there's um
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
as representative patuck says there's an
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
awful lot to be done on this
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
the second part of it is being covered
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
under um senate bill 125 with all the
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
work that was done on that and
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
i don't see where this can be um
 
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.830 align:start position:0%
i don't see where this can be um
salvaged

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
salvaged
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to vote against retention
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
with i'm hoping that a
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
motion to itl will go forward
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay and representative weston
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
i agree with christie um i think there
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
were a number of people that were
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the with
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
melding the dog situation in with
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
everything else about the nanobrewery
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
and rather than spending our time
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
on this why not just let it itl
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
and we've got the other part of the of
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
in 125 anyway so i don't with all the
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
bills we have retained i don't think we
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on the motion

moves

00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
moves
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
out to pass and representative hunt
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
seconds the motion
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the motion of
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh to pass um yes
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
i believe we have an amendment that was
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
distributed by
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
um ms sparling
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
just for grammar and it should have been
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
yes yes i i did
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
and it was it was um filed by
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative van houten
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
right so the
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
purpose of it is simply grammar
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's probably important for something
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to that for just a quick
 
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.910 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to that for just a quick
moment

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
i think it was just a convoluted wording
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
there and um i don't believe i changed
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
the intent whatsoever i ran it by
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative weston who also had
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
concerns about the grammar
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh for her her kind of look-see with it
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
and i assume that everyone has had a
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
chance since yesterday to look at it i
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
do believe i preserved the intent
 
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:06.949 align:start position:0%
do believe i preserved the intent
totally

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
totally
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
just made it a little bit clearer as to
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
what the intent is
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh you'll find the wording i retained
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
most of the words i simply put them into
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
did you run it by the liquor commission
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
i did not
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
i i did in in the hearing i did bring it
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
up in the hearing
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
right now i remember you saying you're
 
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.910 align:start position:0%
right now i remember you saying you're
uncomfortable

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
okay well i did talk to aiden and uh
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
he says it does seem to be just
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
reshuffling the chairs
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
with the paragraph so it's not totally
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh in uh offensive um
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
he said uh he did say it might be
 
00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:51.269 align:start position:0%
he said uh he did say it might be
helpful

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
in the sense that it clarifies the issue
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
of selling
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
versus giving it away which is um
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
stated in another part of the section so
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
that he did not
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
particularly find anything wrong with
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
this pair of
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
so i guess i would say is that assuming
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
we pass this amendment you're
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
you guys you'll be in support of the
 
00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
you guys you'll be in support of the
bill

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:13.390 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
bill
[Music]

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
okay okay so um uh
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative would you uh uh
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion for ought to pass
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
be willing to withdraw your motion and
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can take up another motion
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
emotion is withdrawn okay
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
so uh representative uh so
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
who's who's making this motion is going
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
to be van houghton
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%

out to pass on the amendment and what's
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment number
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
all right is the question clear
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh this is on the amendment uh the clerk
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%

all right just uh catching up um so that
 
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.389 align:start position:0%
all right just uh catching up um so that
was

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%

for the record um if it's not too
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
onerous could we
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
just have the the amendment or the
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%

bill
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah senate bill 17 uh
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
did we discuss the minority report oh
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh the retain it it's a retaining motion
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
so it will not be debated on the floor
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh senate bill 35 relative to
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
membership and risk pools
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative johnson second by
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative patusek moves
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate representative
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
johnson is recognized to speak to a
 
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:52.710 align:start position:0%
johnson is recognized to speak to a
motion

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
hi so um i
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
recommend uh in experience to legislate
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
because this is setting a bad precedence
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
um for future lobbyists trying to
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh really obtain coverage for
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
the organization they're working with it
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
just it sets a bad precedence i think
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
all the way around
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative bartlett
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
i have to say that i'm um vehemently
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to this motion
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
um i think that there's no reason at all
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
why um the employees
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the nea um shouldn't be able to join
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
the risk pool it
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
was set up um as such that there were
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely no objections to it um and i
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
do feel that
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
um they should be able to get into a
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
risk pool
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
there's there's no cost to the taxpayer
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
um drawback um to allowing them to be
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you i absolutely agree with
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett and as i look
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
back through
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
some of the information that was
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
provided to us uh this passed the senate
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
24-0 it passed in committee five to zero
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
secretary of state um has endorsed this
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a political statement by any
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
stretch of the imagination
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
it's simply providing an avenue into
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
should have already been done in the
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
past it was it should have been done
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
when these risk pools were established
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that we'd be doing a great
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
disservice to carve people out simply
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
because they are
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
part of another group um there are many
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
organizations that come to us whether
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
they be lobbyists or or
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer organizations that have vested
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
interest in things because there would
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
be some benefit to them
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exclude them from
 
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.470 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exclude them from
participation

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
in in something that is rightfully
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
theirs and therefore i will be voting
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
against this motion as well
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh in order to preserve something that
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
is appropriate for employees
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh that that they should be having and
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
should have had from the very beginning
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i i would
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh point out representative bartlett
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
risk pools are tax-free
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh so they don't pay the insurance tax
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
so there is some consideration that it
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
does affect the taxpayers and
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
the issue of um and potential adverse
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
election we don't know
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't make a judgment on
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
that but it does seem
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
like a precedent that we probably should
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
not go down
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
any other comments uh from the committee
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call the role
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
please repeat okay so the motion is uh
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%

at issuance or renewal um and they were
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
fine with that we we felt that there was
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit of them
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
ambiguity on at this time on the
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
three zero three thank you one
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry to catch it one three two
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
three zero three
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%

motion
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
so uh representative uh is there any
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett's amendment um i
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
do have one
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative um and uh mr chair
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
maybe you can answer this
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
what was the original intent behind the
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsors of the bill what were
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
they trying to uh
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
change uh well which is not
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
really related to i guess some related
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
to the amendment but um
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
the issue is that right now um we have a
 
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.390 align:start position:0%
the issue is that right now um we have a
statute

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
that requires that when you get a new
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
auto insurance policy you have to stick
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
that you're a resident of new hampshire
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
and it was originally intended to
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that people from other states
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
weren't trying to
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
register their cars in new hampshire to
 
00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:19.110 align:start position:0%
register their cars in new hampshire to
get

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
lower auto insurance rates as it turns
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
out it was
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
some it was somewhat problematic getting
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
people to sign these forms and
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
paperworks and delays as some of you
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
might know it can be rather easy to
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
add another card to your policy it all
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
it takes is a simple phone call
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
but for some auto insurance policies uh
 
00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:40.789 align:start position:0%
but for some auto insurance policies uh
it

00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
did require yet another having you
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
signed that other form again
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
so insurance agents uh uniformly uh have
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
said that most media insurance but was
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
we did see at the last moment there was
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
some you know insurance agents who
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
thought it was a good idea to keep it
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
but the vast majority of them thought it
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
was a good idea to get rid of it
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
and that the disparity in auto insurance
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and it was particularly in
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
massachusetts was the issue
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
has that disparity has gone since
 
00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:09.029 align:start position:0%
has that disparity has gone since
massachusetts

00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
got rid of their no doubt no fault
 
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.070 align:start position:0%
got rid of their no doubt no fault
policies

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
um so so um at this point in time it
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
it's really not necessary and it just it
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
creates a delay for some consumers and
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
getting their insurance
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
all right fair enough any other
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
see none the clerk will call the roll
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%

moves to retain senate bill 38.
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
and you're recognized to speak to your
 
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
and you're recognized to speak to your
motion

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to uh reduce the
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
cost to consumers
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
for the products sold at these
 
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.590 align:start position:0%
for the products sold at these
dispensaries

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
dispensaries
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
and during the testimony it was brought
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
up that what's keeping the prices high
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
is current regulations and so
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
we thought that if we just retain this
 
00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:01.190 align:start position:0%
we thought that if we just retain this
bill

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
let's evaluate with what's currently in
 
00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:04.389 align:start position:0%
let's evaluate with what's currently in
statute

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe whatever the whatever is is
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
whatever those regulations are maybe we
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
need to address
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
that rather than implementing something
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
new uh that may or may not have the
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
desired effect so
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
give this a little bit of time let's
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
let's see what's on the books now if
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
there's something we can repeal or
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
adjust that way
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative bartlett thanks
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
very much um
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
i don't feel we need to retain this i
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
think we um
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
we saw this last year we um voted it
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
through and it was very bipartisan and
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
it was lost in the covid
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
um demise and i do think that
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
um this is affecting the pricing
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
that those that need medical cannabis
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
must pay
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
um that's not covered by insurance in
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
any way
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
so if they can get a reduction in the
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
pricing i think that's really important
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
10 000 patients that are now using
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis in new hampshire
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to vote against retain
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
because i would like to see
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
the bill passed okay
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative abel yes i i want to say
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
i agree with my
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh colleagues from across the aisle
 
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.470 align:start position:0%
uh colleagues from across the aisle
about

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
regulation in this situation
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that this bill we ought to
 
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.630 align:start position:0%
and i think that this bill we ought to
vote

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh to pass this bill because it removes
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
what's been identified as the major
 
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.389 align:start position:0%
what's been identified as the major
regulation

00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
that prevents uh these companies in new
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire from
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
from being able to compete so i would
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
ask you to reconsider
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
your uh your um
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this can i speak to
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh go ahead and put your hand up uh
 
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:55.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson and then
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
you can speak
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
um i i didn't like the retain
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
motion and the reason that i thought
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
that the bill should pass is that this
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
is a bill that's already come through
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee before
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
um it passed the senate 18 to six but
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
it's passed this committee before
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
um or i was told it was passed 18-3 i
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't here to see that happen
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
um it seemed like it was a pretty small
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
change in and um the the only person we
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
could find in the past to insist
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
that these be non-profits was uh
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
governor john lynch
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
and that was a compromise made to get
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
his signature
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
um on this originally that was about um
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
10 years ago it's kind of fuzzy in my
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
mind i can't quite remember
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what the whole discussion was at
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
that time but um
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh when you have one kind of linchpin or
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
one elected official who
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
who requires a compromise and that
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
person is no longer in office then
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
you know when an election is passed we
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
can reconsider
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
those things and and i never heard any
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
concern from anyone about
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
need for them to be non-profits
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
my concern is that they're paying so
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
much money and interest
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
rates to borrow money and if
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do to save
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
businesses in new hampshire money
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
i think that we should we should be
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
doing that so
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
this came over as a bipartisan bill
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
there were actually more republicans
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors on the bill
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
um and um it's certainly a republican
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
platform bill
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to be supporting the bill i
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
would normally vote to retain but since
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
this bill has come through before i'm
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm going to be
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
voting for retain
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
but with with this intention in mind
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
i agree with allowing for-profit status
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
but since there's only four licenses and
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
two of them are owned by the same
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
company uh
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to eventually uh be dragged
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
into the future
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
of having a retail market
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
for cannabis in our state and these
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
three companies are going to be
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
poised to enter that retail market
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important to increase
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
the number of licenses
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
at the same time as allowing for-profit
 
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.750 align:start position:0%
at the same time as allowing for-profit
status

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
so that we set up our future market uh
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
to have competition and not be dominated
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
by a few companies that have had
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know an advantage so i'll be voting
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
but with that idea in mind of increasing
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
number of licenses
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
at the same time there's a lot of
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
for-profit status for
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
a revision for next year so
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
am i can i ask am i off on that
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
um anticipation that
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
that we can accomplish that you're
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're entitled to your opinion yeah
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah representative i really
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
urge you to
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
reconsider this there was no evidence
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
no evidence at all presented that they
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
actually paid a dime
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
of interest when you consider that the
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
fact of the
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
that these things are owned by a
 
00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:20.230 align:start position:0%
that these things are owned by a
for-profit

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana business in massachusetts
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt in my mind
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
that they're loaning that money with
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
expectation that eventually it will be
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
become a for-profit once we legalize
 
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.630 align:start position:0%
become a for-profit once we legalize
marijuana

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
and to suddenly change this statute at
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
this moment
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be uh inappropriate
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh given when we're clearly if you're
 
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.109 align:start position:0%
uh given when we're clearly if you're
really

00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
thinking about what you're going to do
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
to make the business uh
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know the the medicine the product
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
more affordable is to look at all
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
the myriad of regulations
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i hear that they barcode every
 
00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
i mean i hear that they barcode every
plant

00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
plant
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they go around and check in them and
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
they do that and
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
and you know there's no doubt in my mind
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
that they that the whoever is under
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
underwriting these businesses
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
is not paying a lot of interest and it's
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
probably the wrong it's their own cash
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartley have your hand
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
the point is that the recreational
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana is not legal now and it's not
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
going to be legal
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
certainly anytime in the near future
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
because of the um
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
sense of the governor so those that are
 
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.390 align:start position:0%
sense of the governor so those that are
relying

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
relying
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
on the medical cannabis as a better form
 
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.589 align:start position:0%
on the medical cannabis as a better form
of

00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
treatment for their various conditions
 
00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:45.030 align:start position:0%
treatment for their various conditions
that

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
we know that it there is a beneficial um
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
aspect to this that they are being
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
affected now
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
and we've put this off before
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
it was passed i wanted you know i i
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
really think that we need to give some
 
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.109 align:start position:0%
really think that we need to give some
relief

00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
relief
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
um to those that are paying these prices
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
um and this is a way to do it
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are 10 000 patients out there and
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
this affects them
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
but there was no evidence demonstrating
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
that they actually paid a dime in
 
00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:14.150 align:start position:0%
that they actually paid a dime in
interest

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
they never showed us any of their
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
financials we never saw any of that how
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
do you know this is true
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
if i go back to my statement this is
 
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.870 align:start position:0%
if i go back to my statement this is
keith

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
is it possible to increase the number of
 
00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.069 align:start position:0%
is it possible to increase the number of
licenses

00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
with a retained version of this bill or
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
do i need to switch my vote and vote for
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
we if we if we retain the bill it's free
 
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.069 align:start position:0%
we if we if we retain the bill it's free
to

00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
have many anything we want to do to
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
change it we can change it
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
they might have to go to another
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee but it would be free to be
 
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.030 align:start position:0%
committee but it would be free to be
changed

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman during the
 
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman during the
testimony

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
it was presented i don't remember who
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
she was that
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
that was speaking but even if this bill
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
she was still going to go shopping in
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
maine it was just still going to be
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
cheaper wherever she was going to buy it
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
it didn't sound to me like that those
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
who are going out of state
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh were actually going to stay in the
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh i think most of them are probably
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
buying the recreational stuff
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
anyway and not really concerned about
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
the medical
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
aspect of it because they're getting
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
what they consider to be
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
higher quality better flavors whatever
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
the variety that are not going to be
 
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.630 align:start position:0%
the variety that are not going to be
available

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
at the the state stores anyway so
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
as far as they needing help and trying
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
to reduce the price
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
i really don't see where anybody is
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
going to change their habits as it is
 
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.150 align:start position:0%
going to change their habits as it is
anyway

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson is your hand
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
still up from before or
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
did you have something else you wanted
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
to say yeah i wanted to respond to your
 
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.109 align:start position:0%
to say yeah i wanted to respond to your
uh

00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
remark um we i've said this on the floor
 
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:53.750 align:start position:0%
remark um we i've said this on the floor
probably

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
about a dozen times this session we
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
compete in the
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
new england market not just in the new
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire market so when when people say
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
well there are only four licenses for
 
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.349 align:start position:0%
well there are only four licenses for
this

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
or 10 licenses for that in the state or
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
something as a you know
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
only one or two operations consumers
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
live all over new england they shop all
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
over new england and they work all over
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
new england
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
and part of the new hampshire advantage
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
for for businesses and independent
 
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.150 align:start position:0%
for for businesses and independent
contractors

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
and subcontractors is that we want to
 
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.270 align:start position:0%
and subcontractors is that we want to
have

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
as few regulations and as low taxes of
 
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.550 align:start position:0%
as few regulations and as low taxes of
course

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
but as few regulations and as few
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions as humanly possible
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
um on businesses
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
to to maintain that that business
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
friendly environment
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
but we don't generally i mean the
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
republican platform says
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
it as few regulatory restrictions as
 
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.829 align:start position:0%
it as few regulatory restrictions as
possible

00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
and uh we've kind of put this this
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
question in front of the the delegation
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
and they've they've said that they put
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
it into the the platform and that's what
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
we go to the voters with every year
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
less government and uh less regulation
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
um so i'm the the voters approved that
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i i very very rarely find voters who
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
want more restrictions
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
on anything so that that's exactly why
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about retaining it is to
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
is to to reduce restrictions
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
that are on uh that are in this law
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you mr
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
chair um and i think one of the points
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
that um is being made about
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
crossing state lines people are still
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
taking a risk
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
by doing that and i think that
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
those that are that need the medical
 
00:42:43.359 --> 00:42:44.309 align:start position:0%
those that are that need the medical
cannabis

00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
to risk their lives to get a lower price
 
00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:47.510 align:start position:0%
to risk their lives to get a lower price
um

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what they're that's what
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing when they're crossing
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
state lines
 
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
because it is illegal federally um so i
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know i don't have a problem with
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
with allowing more licenses that's
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's fine then that could certainly
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
the the law could be amended
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
um in the future if we were to pass this
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
now um
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
retaining is just going to continue to
 
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.069 align:start position:0%
retaining is just going to continue to
delay

00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
delay
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
um the relief that i believe that
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
but there's no guarantee that the prices
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
will actually go down if we pass this
 
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.870 align:start position:0%
will actually go down if we pass this
legislation

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're you're taking
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
you're taking the word that they're
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
that that's that's an issue for their
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
costs but they never actually said
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
and we promise we will lower our price
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
well i believe that they did say that
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
according to my notes
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
it did say that they would reduce it
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's where increased competition comes
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
in that that will force them
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
trust me i i agree with you

committee feels okay senate bill 49 new
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%

uh representative hunt uh second by

representative matuzik
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
moves out to pass um this
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
these were minor little issues that were
 
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
these were minor little issues that were
left

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
laying around with the trust code
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
statute didn't make it through last year
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
and uh so this the trust code
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
um i guess i i want to emphasize to
 
00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:47.190 align:start position:0%
um i guess i i want to emphasize to
people

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
that i have never and i have sponsored a
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
lot of these trust code bills
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
have never said that this was a
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
huge potential to create jobs in new
 
00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.750 align:start position:0%
huge potential to create jobs in new
hampshire

00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
i've always said that i'm that
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
the reason why i sponsor these bills is
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
i was trying to keep new hampshire
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
on the forefront of our statutes in
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
terms of being competitive with other
 
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.109 align:start position:0%
terms of being competitive with other
states

00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
that were seen to be getting the lion's
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
share of these trust codes
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
and and there was some economic benefit
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
to those states for doing it
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
and so therefore in my mind this bill
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
these are minor little issues that are
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
being addressed and
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why we shouldn't um
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that our trust code is
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
is up-to-date and competitive
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thanks very much
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
investments and setting up the
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
the trust to be able to use socially
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%

representative ammon is recognized to
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair um i moved in
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
expedience legislate
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
um the baseline testimony that we heard
 
00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:55.589 align:start position:0%
um the baseline testimony that we heard
this

00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh this law isn't necessary this is
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
more of like an informational
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh piece of legislation rather than
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
would have an actual impact
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
the uh insurance companies already have
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
the codes
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
to do the referrals um
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so this this isn't there it's my
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that there isn't
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
an issue to be solved that's more of
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
educating the public
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
educating consumers that they have this
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
request the referral from out of the
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
network into the network
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i move on to uh i move it expedition
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
legislate on
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you very
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
much um
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
i have to say that i strongly disagree
 
00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:46.549 align:start position:0%
i have to say that i strongly disagree
with

00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
the itl i think that it's really
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
important that
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
consumers understand that they do have
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
this access
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
i think the collaborative
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
model is important between the pcps and
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
those that are
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
offering um psychiatric care and i think
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
that reimbursement is also important
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
for um this and the insurance companies
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
were in favor of this
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand why you would want
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
to kill
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill that that clarifies this
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
access so of course we'll
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
be opposing the motion
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative burrows yes i i agree
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
with representative bartlett and it's my
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
understanding also that this bill
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
will enable um primary care physicians
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
to get paid
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
for collaborating um with a
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
collaborative care model under this bill
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay well not that i want to pick a
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
fight with everybody here but
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
um there's a little some misleading so i
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure everybody understands
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill is about
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay um in terms of the idea that this
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
is a model legislation because often we
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
use that term model legislation
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
and model legislation means it's a new
 
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.950 align:start position:0%
and model legislation means it's a new
concept

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
and you're implementing it for you know
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know that other states are
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
all adopting this and we're in um so
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
can't be further from the truth this is
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
not a model in terms
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
of um this is anything new the codes
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
have always existed
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
this has always been available to the
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
primary care physician it's not so much
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
to the consumer knowing anything about
 
00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:28.069 align:start position:0%
to the consumer knowing anything about
this

00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's really the primary care physician
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
fundamental purpose of this legislation
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
and i think the sponsors will tell you
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
is to educate primary care physicians
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
that this statute exists well last time
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
i checked doctors don't spend a lot of
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
time reading our rsas
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
and matter of fact i don't think they
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
ever read our essays and that the
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
reality is the only people who do read
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
the rsas
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
are the insurance companies who have to
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
um the insurance companies uh have made
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
it clear to me in no uncertain terms
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
that it's not that they for it or
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
against it
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
or care one way about it um their their
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
only comment
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
is it doesn't seem appropriate to be
 
00:55:11.119 --> 00:55:11.910 align:start position:0%
is it doesn't seem appropriate to be
putting

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
putting
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
a procedure that is available
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
into the statute for no other reason
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
than other than we're trying to educate
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
people that it exists as i said to the
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
medical society when they called me
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
and i said why aren't you teaching this
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
in your continuing education courses so
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
that every primary care physician
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
knows that this is available to them um
 
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
knows that this is available to them um
and

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
he says well that's a good point
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
um there's some little talk about you
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
know that they've changed their position
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
no insurance companies um will tell us
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
are they at the hearing they said they
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
are in support
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
of what the senate amendment did because
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
was problematic and they were in support
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
but that every insurance company will
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
say to you that whether we pass this or
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
don't pass it
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the fact that this is
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
already available
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
and frankly it does somewhat set up an
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
awkward precedent that you're putting
 
00:56:13.839 --> 00:56:14.549 align:start position:0%
awkward precedent that you're putting
procedure

00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
processes which already exist into the
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
statute for no other reason than to
 
00:56:18.799 --> 00:56:19.430 align:start position:0%
statute for no other reason than to
educate

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
educate
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians representative
 
00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.549 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians representative
bartlett

00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
bartlett
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
there are many times that we have to
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
clarify practice
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
and we do it through law we've got 119
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
that signed in on this one with one
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
opposed and one neutral
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
um i think that says something right
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
there and i think when harvard pilgrim
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
comes in dartmouth hitchcock comes in
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
new futures comes in i mean one after
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
the other they know that there is a need
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and it will help consumers but it
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
will also help
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
the practices so that they can be clear
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
that when psychiatric care is
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
called for that they can deliver in a
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
collaborative world
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
without a consumer having to go
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
to another physician to be able to get
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
the care needed
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
the bcp really is the one in many cases
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
that can identify the issues
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
and being able to have this readily
 
00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:21.190 align:start position:0%
and being able to have this readily
available

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
i think is really important
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know how putting it in the
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
statute makes it more readily available
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
than it already is
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
but there are lots of things that we do
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
that helps i think most of the time the
 
00:57:37.839 --> 00:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
that helps i think most of the time the
statutes

00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to health
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
insurance there are mandates to say that
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
so any other discussion on the motion
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
of uh inexpediting to legislate on
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill 59
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%

uh that would be new representative
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
bartlett and i assume it would be out to
 
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.630 align:start position:0%
bartlett and i assume it would be out to
pass

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who wants to do
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay i'm
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
i'm there okay
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think we're close to halfway all
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
right senate bill 66 on premise
 
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.230 align:start position:0%
right senate bill 66 on premise
transportation

00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh one is for delivery um
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
i believe i have an amendment uh so i
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
move uh ought to pass um on
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
let me pull it up amendment number 1398
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and represented by two second seconds
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
my motion
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
about to pass the
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh purpose of the amendment is simply to
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh remove
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
the sunset uh clause in senate bill 66
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
that the restaurants can use the statute
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
going forward forever until we repeal it
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
or something
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
so any other discussion on the amendment
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh to senate bill 66
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative van halen thank you mr
 
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.109 align:start position:0%
representative van halen thank you mr
chair

01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
um this calls to mind another bill
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
fairly recently to which we added a
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
sunset clause for two years because we
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
saw that the
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh the pandemic the covid uh situation
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
had probably been what precipitated it
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
and therefore two years would probably
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
be enough time to do that
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
this is very similar in that sense and
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
that is probably kova driven pandemic
 
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.230 align:start position:0%
that is probably kova driven pandemic
driven

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
driven
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
and yet we're flipping around here i
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
think uh to
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
to get into language that i don't
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
typically will use
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
what's good for the goose is good for
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
the gander i think that
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to be very very fairly
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
consistent in what we're doing if we're
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
going to sunset
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
um legislation that is very similar
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
let's be consistent across the board
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
therefore i feel that this this
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is is counter-intuitive to
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
that was put in previously when we
 
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
talked about the bill of course was the
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
bill about the um
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh the delivery drivers uh going to
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
restaurants and picking up
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh meals when they did not have a
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
contract with them and we
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
didn't get a two-year sunset on that
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
that that was argued by
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
people who are now taking the the
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
opposite tact and i think we're going in
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction to be
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh two-faced about what we do thank you
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay why as though
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
as being the people i will tell you were
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely wrong
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
because the dash doordash grubhub bill
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
was a mandate of a contract
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
which is totally anathema to what we
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
normally would do in this
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
committee and this bill with this sunset
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
was a sunset that if the senate
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
had spent a little more time on it
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
rather than rushing it through because
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
it was a bill that was passed
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
last year and somehow didn't get it get
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
into effect but they didn't happen
 
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
this is a opportunity this is not a
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
mandate this is not forcing anybody to
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
do anything
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
and this is just enabling legislation
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
and so therefore
 
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh rip representative polio
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um i'm not gonna vote for
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
um this um the the amendment
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
um i think alcoholics could
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
in in the future take advantage of this
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
bill and i think it should be looked at
 
01:02:35.039 --> 01:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
bill and i think it should be looked at
again

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
after you know sunset or you know before
 
01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.349 align:start position:0%
after you know sunset or you know before
sunset

01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to you know i'm going
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
to vote to keep the sunset
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
fair enough uh represent fargo
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
um i i'd like to just weigh in as well i
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
think a sunset here is appropriate
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
i guess it's time to to study the
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
effects of this and to determine if it's
 
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.309 align:start position:0%
effects of this and to determine if it's
uh

01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
encouraging people who should be having
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
alcohol delivered to their homes um
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i can't support the amendment
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
i think the sunset should be there
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
as you once told me john in two years we
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
can take it off if we wanna
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's true that's true
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
i didn't blame it on alcoholics but in
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
this case the law is already in effect
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh well actually it's about to expire
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
with the governor's
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh instead of emerging about this
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
fire but
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
so i don't know does anybody knows we
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
have more alcoholics now because of this
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
um i'm just curious is uh are all the
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
people that
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
are supposed to enforce the laws still
 
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.750 align:start position:0%
are supposed to enforce the laws still
there

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh the uh in terms of enforcement
 
01:03:49.039 --> 01:03:49.750 align:start position:0%
uh the uh in terms of enforcement
division

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
is still uh that the bill is in the
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes there so the question is open as to
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're going to have the
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
no there's they're still there right at
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
this moment
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh okay connie is your hand up from
 
01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
uh okay connie is your hand up from
before

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
or are you wondering yes it is thank you
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to respond to your
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
statement from earlier
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
i do understand that there are
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
differences between the bills and i do
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
understand that one deals with a
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
contract and
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
and the other does not uh however i
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
think the difference
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh is is not the same as the
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
similarities the similarities
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
here are that covet that a pandemic
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
brought these
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
issues to the forefront and therefore we
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
have done things to enable our business
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
or to help our businesses
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
to move forward in very dastardly times
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
i hope
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
and and expect that in two years a lot
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
of this will change and as
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
i believe it was representative uh fargo
 
01:04:44.559 --> 01:04:45.190 align:start position:0%
i believe it was representative uh fargo
said

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh we can look at it again in two years
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
but right now let's put the sunset on
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
there so this doesn't fall through the
 
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:50.710 align:start position:0%
there so this doesn't fall through the
cracks

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
cracks
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
let's let it be covered driven let's do
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
the right thing by businesses by having
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
by having this type of thing go on but
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
let's put a sunset on it so that we can
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
be fair and equitable to all the
 
01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.470 align:start position:0%
be fair and equitable to all the
businesses

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i just wanted to let you
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
know that the
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
the doordash gun bill that issue
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit they won was actually prior
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
to cobit
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
so that was a pre pre-coveted issue that
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
these people were but our vote was a
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
code edition when we
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
when we took it up and we voted on it it
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
was a covet issue
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want to argue with you but you

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
in my mind it was a contractual
 
01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.430 align:start position:0%
in my mind it was a contractual
arrangement

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
everybody concerned and
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson your
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
have your hand up first yeah i agreed
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
the need to work on the bill um i think
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's an important issue
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
and uh um for the most obvious reason
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
that all of us were uh
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
born from pregnant mothers uh and in
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
this day and age a lot of women are
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
are still working out of uh necessity
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
and um we went over a lot of different
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
issues during the public hearing
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and opened up a whole can of worms so
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
i i think for that reason we need to
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
put some more time into this
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
wrong button again um i have to say that
 
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.030 align:start position:0%
wrong button again um i have to say that
um

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.830 align:start position:0%
commission works with the business in a
collaborative

01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
collaborative
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
way to be able to help when an
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
accommodation is necessary
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
nothing has rammed down any businesses
 
01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
nothing has rammed down any businesses
throats

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
throats
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
um there's no encouragement to go to
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
court over it
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i think it's ready to pass um it's
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
been passed in the past in the past we
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
lost it last year but um i'm i'm gonna
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
vote against retention
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
because i would like to see it pass now
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i definitely do
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
agree uh as i look over the list of
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
sponsors from the senate and and from
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
the house both
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
i i think we see a bipartisan overview
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
of of points of view uh as
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative breitling mentioned
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's a long history of this bill it
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
moved and changed and beaten and was
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
ready to come forward
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
it is a bill that because of workforce
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
issues and because there are 51 percent
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh of females in in our in our in our
 
01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.550 align:start position:0%
uh of females in in our in our in our
world

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's a pro-business bill it allows
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
women to remain in the workforce and and
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
to be productive in the workforce
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
but it's also pro-family and that it
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
helps to to foster
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
um healthy healthy pregnancies and and
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
to help foster healthy relationships
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
we all have mothers we all had mothers
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
at least we all have sisters and
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
aunts and uncles and and other
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
phenomenal uh caregivers who are
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
very capable of being in the workforce
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
and also very capable of
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
of being good solid mothers and yet
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
we are we are not giving them a little
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
bit of help that
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
that might help them to to make those
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
rules stronger and better for them
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh as the bill states uh if it doesn't
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
work within the business for whatever
 
01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.310 align:start position:0%
work within the business for whatever
reason

01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i can uh i don't know if
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
i can find it offhand
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
um the accommodation would oppose an
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
undo hardship on the operation of the
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
employer's business that has been taken
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
into consideration by the bill as well
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is ready to go forward i think
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
that holding on to it
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
will be a travesty to all women as well
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
as to businesses
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i hope that we will vote accordingly
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh okay representative greeson
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
now thank you mr chairman uh during the
 
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.390 align:start position:0%
now thank you mr chairman uh during the
testimony

01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh the lady named sarah braffman
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
had testified that she was not actually
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
pleased with the wording of the bill
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons and recommended
 
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:15.990 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons and recommended
a

01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment to it and actually sent out
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
an email with a proposed language for an
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
amendment but i have not seen
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
where anybody has sponsored said
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and i thought someone was
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh put put forward an amendment but she
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
had an issue with the wording of
 
01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:31.990 align:start position:0%
had an issue with the wording of
physical

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
physical
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
disability considering pregnancy as a
 
01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.910 align:start position:0%
disability considering pregnancy as a
disability

01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
disability
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
and that's very dangerous i don't think
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
too many women want to i don't know i
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for women god help
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
me if i do
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is is women did not
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
have pregnancy considered a disability
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding of her
 
01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:51.669 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding of her
testimony

01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
so the wording as it is in the present
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
language of the bill says
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh taking a a including
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
a a possibility of a leave of absence
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
for the period of temporary physical
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
disability resulting from pregnancy
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
and that was a language that she did not
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
like and others did not like
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
and so without there being some kind of
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to change that wording
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think this bill needs to pass as
 
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.510 align:start position:0%
i don't think this bill needs to pass as
written

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
her whether or not we adopt uh the
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
wording of her amendment or some other
 
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.790 align:start position:0%
wording of her amendment or some other
wording

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
wording
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh to me it it i don't like the language
 
01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.110 align:start position:0%
uh to me it it i don't like the language
either

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm gonna agree with uh
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
for the simple fact as a woman i find
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
this language offensive
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
i gonna tell you from my experience i've
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
had two children i've worked
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
my employers were more than confident
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know more than reasonably
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
um able to work with me i worked up
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
until the day i gave birth to both my
 
01:14:59.120 --> 01:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
until the day i gave birth to both my
children

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
i chose to put my children in daycare
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
and worked i did take them to work with
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
me at times
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
i had more than ample time for multiple
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know for the different businesses i
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
have worked for
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
more than enough effort was given by
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
our employee my employers and
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is saying that i was
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
a disabled because i was pregnant is
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely horrifying as a woman and i'm
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
sorry i will
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
not be a part of any legislation that
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
tells me i'm
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
representative herbert um
 
01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:43.170 align:start position:0%
not all pregnancies go perfectly
 
01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:44.630 align:start position:0%
not all pregnancies go perfectly
[Music]

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
and so in point of fact i just consider
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
this a
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
pro family bill and uh
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have a good track record in
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
this state in my opinion
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
in regard to that particular uh concept
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
so um as a result of that i'm
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
not going to vote for the motion
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh representing van houghton
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um respectfully this has gone
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
through the senate and has passed in the
 
01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.070 align:start position:0%
through the senate and has passed in the
senate

01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
it has gone through every one of us in
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
this committee and no one has presented
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't appear that anyone has
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
that kind of interest to make that
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
amendment for one and for two
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh retention to make that change that
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
could have been changed prior to this
 
01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:29.910 align:start position:0%
could have been changed prior to this
seems

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
seems
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
as though it's counter-intuitive uh i
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
think it's time for us to take a look at
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing pro business pro
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
family for women in the workforce
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh and to move this forward thank you
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative terry yes thank you mr
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
as i have pointed out to you in
 
01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.709 align:start position:0%
as i have pointed out to you in
conversations

01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we've had recently a conversation
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
that we've had recently
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
as a relatively new member to this
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
although not generally speaking new to
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
the issue of course
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
i am looking for good faith efforts uh
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
to be made to resolve
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
any remaining issues that pertain
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
to some of the concerns that have been
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
addressed today in any others
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can act favorably upon
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to act favorably on
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
um in the uh in the next year very
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
sensitive to issues of
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination and want to make sure
 
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.430 align:start position:0%
discrimination and want to make sure
that

01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
we not be perceived as being
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
discriminatory in in any way
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
and so i hope we can get this fixed and
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
very sorry um in terms of the um
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
the argument that um it's state you know
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
the belief that the
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill states that that pregnancy is a
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
temporary physical disability i read it
 
01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.950 align:start position:0%
temporary physical disability i read it
differently

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
i see it saying that that the way i
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
interpret it is sometimes when you're
 
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:18.630 align:start position:0%
interpret it is sometimes when you're
pregnant

01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
you do have a temporary disability
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
there's the case of a family member of
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
mine who was pregnant
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
and had to be bedridden for two months
 
01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.950 align:start position:0%
and had to be bedridden for two months
um

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
in order to have a full term pregnancy
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
so i don't read it that way and i think
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's saying that there can be temporary
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
physical disability from pregnancy
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
childbirth or
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
other medical conditions so i read it i
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
read it very differently
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative meckler
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um this
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
amendment came
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
under a lot of discussion um i'm aware
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
and it was my initial thought that uh
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
maybe this was a good idea but i think
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
the wording of the amendment
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
would actually make the the bill more
 
01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.470 align:start position:0%
would actually make the the bill more
contentious

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
contentious
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that's why nobody actually
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
brought this particular amendment
 
01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.030 align:start position:0%
brought this particular amendment
forward

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
so i i certainly think this bill is uh
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
is ready to pass
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
um seeing no more hands uh
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
this motion is to retain by
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%

representative bartlett thank you
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
um i i i just shake my head
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand the opposition to
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
passing this bill
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
um again these are bills that have been
 
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:14.550 align:start position:0%
um again these are bills that have been
vetted

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
vetted
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
they are bipartisan they are important
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
to the workforce they're important to
 
01:21:20.239 --> 01:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
to the workforce they're important to
businesses

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
people to work together um to keep them
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
out of court
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
um if there is a an issue there are
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
there's the human rights commission
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
right there um available to to help
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
um with any kind of mediation when if it
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
were necessary
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't know why we want to retain
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
this and
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
and delay it again
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
so i'll be against the retention motion
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i i agree with my colleague
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett i think this
 
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.669 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett i think this
bill

01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
is as friendly to business as any such
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
bill could possibly be
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
as written now um and
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
i also think that it is uh
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
pro-family um because it
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
helps um it helps individuals who
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
have given birth and who are are
 
01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.430 align:start position:0%
have given birth and who are are
employed

01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
employed
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
um and i i can't see any reason to delay
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
it so i
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
i certainly will vote against the motion
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
to retain and think it should go forward
 
01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.189 align:start position:0%
to retain and think it should go forward
as

01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you i i do believe
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
my two colleagues who've just spoken
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
have eloquently stated uh the case
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
just about everything that was said
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
about the prior bill can be said here
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
healthy babies are a healthy future a
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
healthy state i have no
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
understanding as to why we would not
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
want to do very easy types of things to
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
help to ensure
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
healthy babies healthy mothers and
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
business and workforce that can be
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
stronger and better for our state
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
so i urge my colleagues to think about
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
that as you vote
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
um again an anti-family vote
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh for a pro-family idea
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
i'd say it's unfortunate that we are
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
getting that reputation
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
so that's enough said
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
and represented fire um again i think
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
this is a pro family bill
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
i i i'm even appalled that we have to
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislate this this should be a given
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't understand what why
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
we would retain this and i don't think
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
that any of you have really
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
given me a good reason why we would
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
retain this
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
what is wrong with this bill
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
well my understanding is is that the
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day this is an
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
employer mandate and the idea is to how
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
make it so it is something that the
 
01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.430 align:start position:0%
make it so it is something that the
employers

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
are willingly and happily using the
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
human rights commission as a facilitator
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
to get to
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
the right answer but i really like to
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
be mandated yes yes for the question
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes we wouldn't be having this
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
legislation if that happened john
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
so i think because we have not been
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
successful using those venues this is
 
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.550 align:start position:0%
successful using those venues this is
important

01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
for families today so i just
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
i i'm really surprised that that you
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
would stop this
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
that's all i can say i i'll have to say
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
to you uh even the federal law
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
um has problems um i have i've heard
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
from people who
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
are clearly under the federal law but
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
that the process is such that that that
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're not being accommodated
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
so the idea is if we're going to get to
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
the right answer for new hampshire
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
we want to get one that both parties are
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
going into it with
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative van houten you want to
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
you're you're muted so i'm not sure what
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're muted today my apologies um i
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
would just like to point out
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
and remind us that both this bill and
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
the previous bill
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
do have what we call the hardship
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
exemption so it's not quite a mandate
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
the hardship exemption allows any
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
employer to be exempted from the
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
subdivision if it would impose an undue
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
hardship to the employer's operations
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't see that it's quite as quite
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
a mandate it is just a legislation that
 
01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
a mandate it is just a legislation that
will

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
um foster better business relationships
 
01:25:57.679 --> 01:25:58.470 align:start position:0%
um foster better business relationships
between

01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh employees and employers and again
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's pro family it's pro-business
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
aren't we better than to to limit
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
pro-business and pro-family legislation
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
again thank you very much and i hope you
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
consider these issues because
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
we we are not doing justice to to young
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
families and to workforce in new
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we've got to start to do
 
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we've got to start to do
that

01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative greeson thank you mr
 
01:26:22.239 --> 01:26:25.350 align:start position:0%
representative greeson thank you mr
chairman

01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
during the testimony and even
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
asking stories of other people just on
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
the side to see how
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
how much of an impact this is or how
 
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.189 align:start position:0%
how much of an impact this is or how
much

01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
issues that they've had in speaking
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
specifically to women who have been
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
pregnant during working or
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh recently and what i have been able to
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
find and what i heard
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
in testimony was that most businesses
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
are already making these accommodations
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
without there being a law
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh in fact the greatest violator or
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
or the the greatest uh obstacles have
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
been the state of new hampshire itself
 
01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:05.510 align:start position:0%
been the state of new hampshire itself
the

01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
employees of the state of new hampshire
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
when it came to uh private businesses
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
making accommodations they're already
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
being done as much as possible that's
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
already being done
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
i i would love to know how many
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination lawsuits or complaints or
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
whatever have actually been filed i'm
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
not saying there's not any at all
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
but i wonder how small that number
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
actually in reality is
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
because we certainly if it were a huge
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
issue would have come out in testimony
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the only complaint was against the
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs yeah i just say
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
quickly that
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
um just because just because uh they're
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
just because you're saying that we
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
haven't heard a lot of complaints
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
that there are problems for employees
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
particularly vulnerable people
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
who don't have a voice um you know low
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
low wage workers who don't don't feel
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
speak out for fear of losing their
 
01:28:08.239 --> 01:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
speak out for fear of losing their
employment

01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
so um i think that right there is is
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
good uh seeing no more hands the motion
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
is to retain
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%

01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh so then 97 okay here's my
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
and uh trying to find the amendment was
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
it distributed
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
to us it was sent out by pan well no
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh well this one i have asked a less
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh i do not see it i got it from yes
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
pam sent it out okay on may 11th
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
oh under amendments yeah search pam and
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i did okay so what
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh even though it's restating the whole
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy piece
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
and the bill um it all it really did was
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
remove section one of the bill
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
so uh and section one as you right
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
recall that was the direct care
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
and which had was extremely problematic
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
so rather than
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
trying to fix that we want the pharmacy
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
so so representative hun second

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
you need yeah you need to you need to
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
is that working yes uh so my question is
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
um what the original intent of the bill
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
i've got the amendment from me i don't
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
have the original bill
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
um so what what were they trying to uh
 
01:33:02.159 --> 01:33:04.149 align:start position:0%
um so what what were they trying to uh
prevent

01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh this is just a process uh
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the the pharmaceutical uh pharmacies
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
and um in terms of how the these
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
drugs are uh are the retail form
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's being used and um it was to
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
allow for mail order uh and to do that
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay i'm looking at the amended bill
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
again and i'm not seeing that it just
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
looks like a prohibition
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh okay
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
um this is a uh as a as related to the
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
network manager the problem the pharmacy
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
benefit managers
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh but that it it does allow the
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacies to
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
yeah representative bartlett thank you
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
my notes here say that um taylor brennan
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
um testified on part two and he thinks
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's fairly complicated he think he
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
questioned whether
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
this would be increasing the costs on it
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't think this is ready
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
to be um to be passed um i
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
would be opposing the otp um
 
01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:37.110 align:start position:0%
would be opposing the otp um
motion

01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
well i mean i i didn't nobody had any
 
01:34:39.679 --> 01:34:40.709 align:start position:0%
well i mean i i didn't nobody had any
opposition

01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
to it but um well we could we could
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
certainly retain it i'm i'm not
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
i don't i wouldn't yeah the new uh new
 
01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.149 align:start position:0%
i don't i wouldn't yeah the new uh new
hampshire

01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
independent pharmacies also had um
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
problems with part two
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
um they pre they it says stops retail
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacies from mailing to a patient
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
and even if they the pharmacists were
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
willing to pay a fee
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
um the pbms could say the pharmacy would
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
not get reimbursed for the prescription
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire insurance department
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
wants to add some other amendment
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and they were hoping the part two
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
would be separated from part one but
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
part two still had issues
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i i can't okay i thought rick newman
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
said he was okay
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh i can see retaining this one but i
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
can't see passing it so that was
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
that was prior to the bill that's being
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
spent but i can read to you
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
what rick newman wrote me mr chairman i
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
see senate bill 57 is scheduled for an
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
exec session
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'm aware that part one of the bill was
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of controversy however part
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
two dealing with allowing
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
retail pharmacies to use mail to device
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh to device prescription
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
i believe has no opposition
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
i represent the new hampshire
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
independent pharmacy association
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
and they support part two all
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders reach agreement on language
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
when this issue is in senate
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
can we get this section passed happy to
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
discuss you with your convenience
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay well that's correct that corrects
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
what i've got in here
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay so that i i've always been on the
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
assumption that that
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
that part was okay okay sorry
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
so uh remember fargo does he work with
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
tyler perry because i too had notes that
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh that um tyler had some
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations for an amendment to
 
01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.270 align:start position:0%
recommendations for an amendment to
purchase

01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh i i i don't see a problem with
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
retaining this and getting some clarity
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
from him since
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
he does the regulations and i think i
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
think that's important well
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i what i would probably do is
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
not retain it and that at this moment
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
that i'll just call another exact
 
01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:50.390 align:start position:0%
that i'll just call another exact
session

01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
and and then and then in the meantime
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
we'll get this sorted out
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
all right i think it's just great to
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
hear what tyler has to say yeah
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
my notes do show that he has some
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
question about it okay well
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh i do have hands up over here if we
 
01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
uh i do have hands up over here if we
want

01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh see uh tyler i will allow tyler since
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
he's the stan employee
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
i will uh oh tyler did you just put your
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
tyler just disappeared are you still
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
there tyler
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
oh there he is okay all right i'm going
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
to promote
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
him so tyler can tell us
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay good morning tyler good morning
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can hear me
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
um so thanks for that i apologize for
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
lowering the hand before you actually
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
saw me that you had the the only concern
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
we had is that the
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
change that it does it changes the pbm
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
section of the insurance statute but the
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
way pbm
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
is defined there it does not include
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
when an insurer owns its own pbm
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
and that pbm service is just that
 
01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.470 align:start position:0%
and that pbm service is just that
insurer

01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
insurer
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
so you would impose be imposing a
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
requirement just on the pbms that are
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
operating under that traditional model
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
so the only suggestion we had is if you
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
want the new requirement
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
to apply more broadly you'd also include
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
the same language
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay so you know so we'd have to pay
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
lift it and also put it in
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
in the other side no do we have anybody
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
i know anthem was talking about having
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
their own pbm has anybody actually done
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
that yet
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i think that's the direction um
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
i believe both harvard and cigna are now
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
i mean excuse me anthem insignia are
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
there and harvard is still using a pdm
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
that will
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
serve as multiple other carriers and
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the other small carriers will
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
continue to use those traditional pbms
 
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
so it's um you could potentially have a
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
different standard every time but
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
again it's a relatively small chain so
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge deal but
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
that being said i think if we hear from
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies that we're not
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
requiring um the new you know the new
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition uh more broadly that would
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
be the reason
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
i think it could create some confusion
 
01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.430 align:start position:0%
i think it could create some confusion
still

01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative fargo did you
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me weston i just want to say that
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
i do remember that discussion that um
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
tyler brennan just brought up but
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
there's also one other small error
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
in this amendment and that is that the
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
effective date says part two but i
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
believe this is only one part now
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
so effective data is part two when you
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
only have
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
when the when you're part one is the
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
bill part two is the effective date that
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's normal
 
01:39:35.679 --> 01:39:38.870 align:start position:0%
that's normal
process

01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
um so i do have rick newman and curtis
 
01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:42.870 align:start position:0%
um so i do have rick newman and curtis
berry

01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
berry
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
one of one of the people i'm sorry john
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's not what i'm talking about if you
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
look at the last line
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
this uh we took out part one
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
correct one doesn't exist anymore right
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
in the new bill that we would be passing
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment part one now
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
is the was two of the old
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill so now that's part one and then
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
whereas in that bill uh the effective
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
date was part
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
three now the effective date is now part
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
two well it still doesn't make sense to
 
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
me but i'll take your word for it
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
i see what representative weston is
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
saying mr chairman
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay reference to part two in section
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
two should have been removed from the
 
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.189 align:start position:0%
two should have been removed from the
amendment

01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we'll let's get this
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill fixed
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
as long as we're working some more we'll
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
work we'll call i'll
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
call another sex session um and
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if it'll be next week
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
only because
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
today is thursday it might have to be
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
the last week it will probably have to
 
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:52.950 align:start position:0%
the last week it will probably have to
be

01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh that to next tuesday a week two weeks
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%

okay we'll with the uh
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%

01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
i withdraw
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%

01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%

01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
palma uh uh
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
are you are you willing to withdraw your
 
01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.669 align:start position:0%

emotion

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh is that it has been amended uh which
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
sounds like it might need to be further
 
01:41:38.159 --> 01:41:39.109 align:start position:0%
sounds like it might need to be further
amended

01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
and uh at that point we will then uh

take up
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
um take up senate bill 97 in two weeks

01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
the financial assistance for businesses
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%

01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative ham second by
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
representative patusek
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
moves in expedient to legislate and and
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative him is recognized to
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much um
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
this bill uh offers um
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
funding assistance uh for
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
businesses that were started after
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
um the cutoff date the may
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
26th during covid
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
um in my mind um
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
in my mind it's less necessary now
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh and these businesses made a choice to
 
01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.350 align:start position:0%
uh and these businesses made a choice to
start

01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
um given the covid they didn't
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
experience adverse effects
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
because they were a going concern and
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
covert came along and and made it
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
difficult for their business and
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
and their employees i'm one of those
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
i i didn't expect assistance i made my
 
01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:15.669 align:start position:0%
i i didn't expect assistance i made my
decision

01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
with the with the givens in place and so
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
i i suggest that it should be
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
hey uh representative yeah i don't agree
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
um i don't have my notes here but i seem
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
to remember some
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh business owners who um were
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
talking about how you just don't open up
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
a business one day
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
it takes three four years sometimes to
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
get all the funding and everything
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know the um everything in place
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
before you actually
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
open up so some of these businesses
 
01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.510 align:start position:0%
open up so some of these businesses
started

01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
started
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
not in operation but you know being
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
formed and money being spent two three
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.149 align:start position:0%
 
assistance

01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh representative bartlett
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um yeah i'm um
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
looking at my notes here as as well i've
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
got one there's um a brewpub
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
um the investing took a year um
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
had to get through various uh
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
regulation and opened in september 2019.
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
they closed march 16th for the
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
governor's order
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
um they had not planned on takeout so
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
they had to really change their
 
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
business model to begin you know right
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
off the bat because six months into a
 
01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:41.430 align:start position:0%
off the bat because six months into a
restaurant

01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
is certainly you know they're not making
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
a profit at that point then there's
 
01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:44.950 align:start position:0%
a profit at that point then there's
another

01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
one um where we had testimony from
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
a man mr clark who owns two restaurants
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
in durham
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
um and it took him a while after months
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
of planning opened up in march and
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
immediately was shut down
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
so they aren't re they aren't eligible
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
for this financial assistance
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
um and i do think that you know we
 
01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
we really need to consider these
 
01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:08.629 align:start position:0%
we really need to consider these
businesses

01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
so that they are eligible and there has
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
been one point
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
what two billion dollars more has been
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
um sent to new hampshire that will be
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
distributed over the next couple of
 
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.070 align:start position:0%
distributed over the next couple of
months

01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i really think they should be able
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for it
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
so i think this bill is really important
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
well why wouldn't they be available
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
because this bill is saying that um
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
main street relief fund uh for
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
businesses established it after may 26
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
of 2019
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the may street fund is done it's
 
01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.790 align:start position:0%
and the may street fund is done it's
over

01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
but there's more money that's come in
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
right so that will be
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
that will have to be have a new name but
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
it certainly wouldn't have the same
 
01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:50.310 align:start position:0%
it certainly wouldn't have the same
parameters

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
as the main street fund did which was
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
the day
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
but that was all based upon the closing
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
of may you know that may 19
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
and saying show us what your business
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
what you were doing in the year before
 
01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:04.149 align:start position:0%
what you were doing in the year before
that

01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
do you know for a fact that this new
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
around of money
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
will include these businesses so because
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's money still left over that has
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
not been distributed from the first
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
relief fund i know for a fact that the
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
ppp money that was just
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
which i guess they just ran out was
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely available to everybody
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't limited to anybody right and
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
that the new funding that's coming
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
in the uh the legit they they
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh the committee has not disturbed
 
01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:32.629 align:start position:0%
uh the committee has not disturbed
determined

01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
exactly how that's going to be doled out
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh but that it certainly would not have
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
the same requirement
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
that that main street fund did right
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
because that main street fighter was an
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
emergency funding
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
at that moment and it was based upon
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
what your business did the year before
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
so if they were to do it again this year
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't take
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
take that model they would be picking up
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
a new model which is how to help
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
businesses to go
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
forward and that would be all businesses
 
01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:02.550 align:start position:0%
forward and that would be all businesses
and

01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
certainly would not have that
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
requirement involved in it
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
so yes all new businesses all those
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
businesses who didn't get funding out of
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
that program
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
would certainly be eligible for any new
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
proposals that is going forward
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
so what if these businesses had to close
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
after six months
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
and they didn't have the financial
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
ability to reopen because they weren't
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
eligible for that first one
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
are you saying the second one will apply
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
to those businesses
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that they they will make
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
that i mean in terms of that
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance i don't think this bill
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
would solve that problem either
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
yeah you've got to have some specific
 
01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.149 align:start position:0%
yeah you've got to have some specific
funding

01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
mechanism to say is okay you know we're
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh fund businesses that close and reopen
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
now you have to remember if this was an
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
obscure situation
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
it was based simply on the fact that
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
how do they know how much money to help
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
you out with your business
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
if they didn't know how much money you
 
01:47:59.119 --> 01:47:59.990 align:start position:0%
if they didn't know how much money you
lost

01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
lost
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
because you were in business the year
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
before well insurance companies do
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
this all the time for a business income
 
01:48:06.159 --> 01:48:07.350 align:start position:0%
this all the time for a business income
loss

01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
loss
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's not easy but it certainly can be
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
done and
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
i think this is all the more reason why
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
the governor needs to be disclosing
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
where the money has been distributed
 
01:48:20.229 --> 01:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
under his largesse this bill this all
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
is say we hope he will do something this
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't do anything
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it really sends a false message of
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
that saying that we are doing something
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
when when we're really not doing
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
anything and like i said
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
any the new money that's coming in will
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
be spent you know that they will not be
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
using that requirement that that
 
01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:40.470 align:start position:0%
using that requirement that that
particular

01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know mainstream program did have
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
because that was in the beginning of the
 
01:48:44.159 --> 01:48:45.109 align:start position:0%
because that was in the beginning of the
coven

01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
coven
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
crisis uh
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
next up representative abramson uh yeah
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
this is more of a question i mean
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
if it's if there had still been money in
 
01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
if it's if there had still been money in
this

01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
in this fund specifically the main
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
street relief fund or at least by the
 
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
time this bill
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh gets signed were to be signed by the
 
01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:03.590 align:start position:0%
uh gets signed were to be signed by the
governor

01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
um for these businesses that that
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
began operation after may 26
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
2019 how could they have or would they
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
have any funds or revenue or is it even
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
possible for them to have any funds or
 
01:49:16.159 --> 01:49:17.030 align:start position:0%
possible for them to have any funds or
revenue

01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
to qualify uh for this is
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
right i
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
maybe if anybody i'm not asking this as
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
a rhetorical question matt can ask
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
asking this is an actual question
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
is there any possible way that a
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
business that that's not even
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
operating could have revenues before may
 
01:49:35.199 --> 01:49:38.550 align:start position:0%
operating could have revenues before may
26th

01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative him did you want
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
to speak again
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
yes and that was part of my thought um i
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
i looked at it and there's no way i
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
could fill it out i had no
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
revenue i could not fill out an
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
application very accurately
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
i couldn't say what i was going to do or
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
not do
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
so i just feel that this late
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
in in the covid uh process that
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
that um it was a program based on
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
certain criteria and i just they made
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
a program would be good perhaps for
 
01:50:13.199 --> 01:50:14.310 align:start position:0%
a program would be good perhaps for
folks

01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
um that uh struggled or didn't make it
 
01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:17.910 align:start position:0%
um that uh struggled or didn't make it
but

01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
to me it didn't seem like this was the
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
one and there were rules
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
and and if you came after that date well
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative herbert uh
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm inclined to vote um
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
with my colleagues across the aisle here
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's very uh this is in such huge flux
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
making law at this point in time
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
when we really don't have as as you said
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think there's
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
one point something uh you know yada
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
yada yada yada
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
a bunch of zeroes that are coming into
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh more i just think that it's
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
it's not our business to be it would be
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
nice if we knew what the governor was
 
01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:11.109 align:start position:0%
nice if we knew what the governor was
doing

01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
but uh absent that i don't i'm very
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable passing legislation that
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
make decisions of this kind
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.109 --> 01:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
yes um i
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh it as i as i read this
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
very short bill it does reference
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the main street relief
 
01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.149 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the main street relief
fund

01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
but then it goes on to say that that
 
01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:43.830 align:start position:0%
but then it goes on to say that that
anyone

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
who was not eligible for that would be
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
available for federal relief and it's
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specify that it has to become
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
has to come from that program
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
it just says that you you can be
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for further relief
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
through any program as long as it comes
 
01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
through from the federal government
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that we should in fact go
 
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:08.870 align:start position:0%
so i think that we should in fact go
forward

01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
with this as a statement of what the
 
01:52:12.239 --> 01:52:13.189 align:start position:0%
with this as a statement of what the
legislative

01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
legislatures at uh intent
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
is and that it would make it would make
 
01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:20.830 align:start position:0%
a big difference
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:22.149 align:start position:0%
a big difference
[Music]

01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
if this were passed so i urge us to pass
 
01:52:24.719 --> 01:52:26.950 align:start position:0%
if this were passed so i urge us to pass
it

01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
and represent bullio you've spoken
 
01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:31.589 align:start position:0%
and represent bullio you've spoken
already

01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
no um do we know that they're
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
about the status of the main street
 
01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.149 align:start position:0%
about the status of the main street
relief

01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
relief
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
fund is there like no more money in the
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
fund do we know that for sure
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
yes that was that was a short that was a
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
it was a short plan
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
short program and is the fun
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
still available i mean not the funds but
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
is that mechanism still available do we
 
01:52:54.639 --> 01:52:55.589 align:start position:0%
is that mechanism still available do we
know

01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
no because if the federal money comes
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
back comes in
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
to the state he might that he might put
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
it in the main street relief fund
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
and call it that i have full confidence
 
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
that the governor
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
heard about the problem and what
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
happened and we'll make sure that
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
that those businesses will not be
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
negatively affected he doesn't need this
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
legislation to tell him
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson yeah i'm
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to figure out if
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
there's any possible theoretical way
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
that this could do something
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
the bill says to the extent permitted by
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
federal law federal refunds received by
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire to assist
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
businesses affected by the coved 19
 
01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:40.070 align:start position:0%
businesses affected by the coved 19
pandemic

01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
shelby made a fit available to
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
businesses that were not eligible for
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
grants from the main street relief fund
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
because their businesses were
 
01:53:47.119 --> 01:53:47.830 align:start position:0%
because their businesses were
established

01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
i mean it just does the bill do it
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
does the bill do anything that the
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
governor can't do already right now
 
01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:04.310 align:start position:0%
governor can't do already right now
no

01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh everybody
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
the motion is an awesome question it's
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a rhetorical question i'm
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
asking if there are any of the
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
supporters of the bill who
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh when we uh if if someone wants his
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay so representative
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
would you like to answer him
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
okay no i have something separate okay
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
so just so you understand uh
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative abrams and you know you
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
you you might not meant it to be a
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question you wanted an answer
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean anybody has to
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
answer you
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah representative van halen um
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say we intend to
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
meet in two weeks anyway to consider
 
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh information on another bill is it
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
possible that we could get someone in to
 
01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:52.629 align:start position:0%
possible that we could get someone in to
clarify

01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
the direction as we know it to be today
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
and to make a better judgment on the
 
01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
basis of that information
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
he hasn't taken my word for it but um
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
you really want to
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
delay this bill okay i mean i i i mean
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
i i would i it would have to be you
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
to go out and find something okay
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
i i you know i talked to
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
taylor and and he told me that you know
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
whatever new money's coming in it's
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to be whatever new rules whatever
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
new parameters
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know i know there's a bunch of
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
parameters because it's the money's
 
01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:32.870 align:start position:0%
parameters because it's the money's
going

01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
right through the state this new federal
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
money uh and
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
the feds have plenty of requirements as
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
it is but
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
to uh um whether there's any anything in
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
here where there's going to be
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
actual direct payments by this day
 
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
to businesses i i don't know if that's
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
the question you're asking
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
but um i if you'll have to go out and
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
find that answer but i mean i don't i
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
might my comment what i heard was who
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
knows you know
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're still trying to we through i
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
guess what the requirements are but
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
it was clear that this uh this bill was
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
about a an obscure event
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
that was set based purely on
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
how do we decide how much money to give
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
a business
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
and the only way we can do that is we
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
got to look at what their books were a
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
year prior
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned that we could
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
potentially close doors to businesses
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh much like representative will you
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
were saying who did invest time and
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
energy and
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
and everything the problem i have with
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
that is if you're assuming that the
 
01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:34.470 align:start position:0%
that is if you're assuming that the
governor

01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
when this bill showed up on his desk he
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
would veto it
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then say screw those people i'm
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
gonna um you know
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i can't it doesn't make
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
any sense to me
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
to build in the first place because
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
it was it was an obscure event it's
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
scary thing that happened and but then
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're and it's all about the governor
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
ordering the governor to do something
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the governor has to sign or veto the
 
01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:02.390 align:start position:0%
and the governor has to sign or veto the
bill

01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
so i i just don't understand why
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's legislation in the first place
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
nice help personally but if if uh
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to wait but since we are
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
agreed to to take up another bill we can
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
we can wait another two weeks on this
 
01:57:19.199 --> 01:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
we can wait another two weeks on this
bill

01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's fine that would be good all right
 
01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:23.030 align:start position:0%
that's fine that would be good all right
so

01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh represent him are you willing to
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
yes that would be good to get some more
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
answers absolutely since we're meeting
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
again anyway
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
okay and uh representation you're
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
willing to withdraw your second
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay all right john yes
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to reach out to
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
taylor to get a statement from him
 
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
on the basis of what he knows to be the
 
01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:45.189 align:start position:0%
on the basis of what he knows to be the
situation

01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
i i could certainly uh he's kind of hard
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
to get hold of but
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
i'll be trying i will i will reach out
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
to see what i can get from him too
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
to clarify um
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
he doesn't like to he generally he
 
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't like to wait too much into
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and you know but if if you
 
01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:06.550 align:start position:0%
legislation and you know but if if you
could

01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
um if you want to phrase the question
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
you want i will forward that question to
 
01:58:11.679 --> 01:58:12.470 align:start position:0%
you want i will forward that question to
him

01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
all right i'll check with you offline
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
after i have a chance to think about
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
all right all right um
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
all right senate bill 124 the on the bus
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
insurance legislation uh
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative hunt seconded by
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative patusek moves
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
ought to pass is there any anybody
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
question this is four different items
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're all related to
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
allowing different industries to be able
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
to um and sell insurance products
 
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
without being
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
insurance agents and licensed agents so
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson you have a
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
yep i just wanted to to re-bring up the
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
the same uh issue that i brought up
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
during the hearing public hearing
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
which is that uh i don't like omnibus
 
01:58:57.679 --> 01:58:58.790 align:start position:0%
which is that uh i don't like omnibus
legislation

01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
um out on the seacoast we did campaign
 
01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.950 align:start position:0%
um out on the seacoast we did campaign
against

01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
omnibus legislation where you put four
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
issues together it is a legitimate
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
um it's a legitimate question about
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
whether four different insurance bills
 
01:59:14.070 --> 01:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
are germane
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
to the same subject and i felt that uh
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
we should vote
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
individually on the on these four bills
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
on the floor they're all four i think
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
are bipartisan
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
but i i i felt strongly after seeing
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
some of the comments
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
after uh the flurry of real omnibus
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
bills where they had 35 or 40 different
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
bills unrelated bills packed into one
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
of the the public comments when you had
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
unrelated bills that were
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
that were all put together into a single
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill that the public generally
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
didn't like that at all
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
and i didn't see that the senate was
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
saving us any time by
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
taking four bills that had four lsr
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
numbers they all had different sponsors
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
and co-sponsors
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
um and it it makes the the hearings very
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
to do that so i i i feel like we need to
 
02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know contact the senate or or
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
something and just say please don't
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know don't bundle bills together and
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
send it to uh to the house
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
would would you feel better if we took
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
amended the bill or took the word
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
omnibus out of the title
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
no it's it they started as they started
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
in the senate as four separate bills
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
they are they they're arguably germane
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're all on insurance
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
agent issues um but i
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
i really felt like each of these bills
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
deserved a separate hearing it make
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
it makes the hearings much more
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
complicated and
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
you might have you may have a few
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
members of the house who support
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
say three of these bills and then oppose
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
one do they have to vote

otp you have to have the event
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
you would have it have to have an
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
amendment drawn up correct itl but i'll
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%

02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
blurb okay so your uh abrasion's motion
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
senate bill 125.
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh my representative hunt and second by
 
02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative patusik
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
moves uh the amendment
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
to one two five
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
does anybody have the the amendment
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
number handy 12 37
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
h 12 37 8 is correct
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we did have a hearing so i think
 
02:04:42.629 --> 02:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
pretty much everybody
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
we've kind of thrashed through this um
 
02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:45.990 align:start position:0%
we've kind of thrashed through this um
so

02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
i think it's pretty straightforward but
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a it's a
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's a good step in getting um you know
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
the uh helping the the uh
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
brewers and beer manufacturers and uh
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
and there's a little bit of something in
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
here for everybody so i think it's a
 
02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's worthy to be passed so any other
 
02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion about to pass
 
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%

02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
question representing that
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i missed cued on that last
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
item and i apologize for that
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
um i did vote for the amendment
 
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
um for the most part i believe that
 
02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
amendments do clarify and and
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
make better the underlying bill however
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
with the addition of the amendment
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
we end up with what's essentially an
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill you've heard me speak
 
02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
at least three times about the
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
three-tier system and the erosion of the
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
3ts tier system
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh i see this bill as part of a big
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
jenga game that that
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
structural wooden game that we pull
 
02:07:12.069 --> 02:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
pieces out hopefully
 
02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
not knocking over the structure i think
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
there's so much here
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh that it isn't whether the the
 
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
three-tier system should or should not
 
02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:21.109 align:start position:0%
three-tier system should or should not
exist

02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
exist
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is something that will erode it
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
without being able to fix it
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
i i found it very interesting that um
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative abramson and i agreed
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
very definitely
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
that this kind of bill is something that
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
should go through a subcommittee
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh john you've committed to having
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittees the liquor subcommittee
 
02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
might be a place to vet this type of
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
thing maybe
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
teasing out pieces or whatever the case
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
might be even ahead
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
ad hoc committee during the summer a
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
group of people who care about
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the liquor
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
commission i think we just have a whole
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
lot going on here i think that
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
we've mixed in direct shipping i was
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
looking over kate fry's email
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
as as you know i do kind of review my my
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
bills both the night before it and then
 
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
the morning afterward
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
and she asked some good questions about
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh maybe we should clarify training for
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
age verification and for
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
over service of young people prohibiting
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
delivery to college addresses
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
there's just so much going on here as
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know i've worked on liquor bills for
 
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
four years i was on the subcommittee as
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
chair last time
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
so i am sensitive to some of the issues
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
here and i am really sensitive to small
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
business i worked with representative
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
patusik on some tourism
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
related to uh to alcohol bills it is
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
just such a major big
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
ball of wax that we would be doing
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
justice to everybody all the way around
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
to retain this bill
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
and to work on it to really work on it
 
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
and maybe as we're working on it to take
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
a good look at the three chair system
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying whether it belongs or
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong it's a skeleton that has
 
02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:47.589 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong it's a skeleton that has
been

02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh fleshed out in a variety of ways
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
since after prohibition is my
 
02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:52.950 align:start position:0%
since after prohibition is my
understanding

02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
and uh i i do think that we would all be
 
02:08:55.599 --> 02:08:56.709 align:start position:0%
and uh i i do think that we would all be
benefited

02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
benefited
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
by slowing down on this one this is just
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
way too much
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
i do and i appreciate that you had the
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
separate hearing on it by the way i
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
think that that was very helpful
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
but that just elucidated the problem
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
this so much is going on
 
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
that um we we need we need to slow this
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
one down we really need to
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
i i believe we need to vote to retain
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore i will be voting
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
against the otpa and hopefully to
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
present a retain
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative fargo
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah i have to agree with connie on
 
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
this i i really do think we should
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
retain this i think there's a lot
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
a lot here i i think um even after the
 
02:09:38.639 --> 02:09:39.270 align:start position:0%
a lot here i i think um even after the
audit

02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
audit
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
of the liquor commission and the
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
potential changes that might be
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
happening there
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we've spent a lot of time on
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
liquor over the last
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
um couple of years and i i just think it
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
needs a little
 
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit more discussion um so i i
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
support connie's idea
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
of retaining this and either having
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee take it over or something
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
and see if we can move it forward after
 
02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:05.589 align:start position:0%
and see if we can move it forward after
that

02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you mr
 
02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:08.790 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you mr
chair

02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know it it's funny that even even um
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
the lobbyist um henry veyu
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
had to talk to you and me and
 
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
to others on our committee um over the
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
past week because of
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
some of the confusion over the
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant and lodgings
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
position over the past month or two
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
um and i think that certainly there have
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
been a number of questions that have
 
02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
come up
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
on this one um even among the lobbyists
 
02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:39.990 align:start position:0%
on this one um even among the lobbyists
and

02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
how they presented to us i know that
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
the last position that the restaurant
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
and lodging
 
02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
association has is that they're now
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
neutral on it where they had been
 
02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
pretty opposed to it in the beginning um
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
i think that there there is validity in
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
retaining this
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
um yes i think the amendment made it a
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
better bill
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
but i i have to agree that there's an
 
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
awful lot
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
to consider as we continue to
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
pass bills that are eroding the
 
02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
three-tier system
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
so i will vote against the otpa
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative patousek thank you
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:11:27.189 --> 02:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh as somebody who's been fairly
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
intimately involved with this bill
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
also uh and the manufacturers
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
and uh the brew the nanos and the
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
brewpub people
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
all are positive as to what they can do
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
and this will result in more revenue for
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
them and help the small businesses in
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote to otpa this
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
and moving on so that these
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
small businesses this summer will have
 
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh represent van houden you wanted to
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
speak again
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
yes this time i do thank you um and i
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
agree with representative patusik
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
i support small business i support these
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
these young startup
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh businesses that we're looking at but
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's incumbent upon us to get
 
02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
the legislation right
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
we are in a bit of a sweet spot right
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
now we have the audit and
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
and some of the changes that have
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
happened to some of the changes that may
 
02:12:30.719 --> 02:12:31.350 align:start position:0%
happened to some of the changes that may
happen

02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
we have lots of legislation happening we
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
have some lessons coming out of the
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
colbit pandemic that relate to liquor
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
and liquor
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh liquor procedures going forward i
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
think it's a really good time it's
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
a sweet spot for us to sit back take a
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
look at this um
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
get a subcommittee with even if it's an
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
ad hoc committee
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
i see the issues as being bipartisan
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
i've worked very well across the aisle
 
02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:53.830 align:start position:0%
i've worked very well across the aisle
with

02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
with people on these issues uh and and
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
some of us have had similar
 
02:12:59.830 --> 02:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
sentiments regardless of party it's not
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
a party issue
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an issue of getting this
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
right the economic backbone that is
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
provided by the liquor commission and by
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
the liquor sales
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
is well worth getting it right and i
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
just think we have a
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
a doorstop we can finally say hey look
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
if we take a few months we can make this
 
02:13:16.719 --> 02:13:17.189 align:start position:0%
if we take a few months we can make this
better

02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
and i hope we would consider that i
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
would like to vote to
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
to retain uh after the otpa is
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
spelled thank you okay
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
so uh just i retaining something
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
is meaning that we can identify
 
02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
something specific that we want to fix
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
or change or revisit um i haven't heard
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
anything that anything specific other
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
than this global
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
retaining and and and
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
frankly you know when it comes to new
 
02:13:50.639 --> 02:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
frankly you know when it comes to new
futures

02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
futures
 
02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
i mean as new futures mission is
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
to to if they had their druthers we
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
would be going the complete opposite we
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
would be cutting off licenses we would
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
be reducing the amount of people
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know they got access to alcohol
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
because that's their mission statement
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure that's that's something
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to hang my hat on and why i
 
02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
should retain a bill
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
um and if they feel some of those issues
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
are important they
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
certainly i can find you as a sponsor
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
and you can sponsor those builds
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
this discussion about three tier and i
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
really want uh
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know make it clear to everyone the
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
three tier
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
is a theoretical concept okay
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
it in terms of how it it's built
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
and we will always
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
have the three tier we always because
 
02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:43.910 align:start position:0%
have the three tier we always because
each

02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
each
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
the tiers are easily identifiable and
 
02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.910 align:start position:0%
the tiers are easily identifiable and
their

02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
purposes and missions are identifiable
 
02:14:50.639 --> 02:14:51.589 align:start position:0%
purposes and missions are identifiable
the

02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
what we've been tearing down was the
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
three-tier created artificial
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
barriers inside each of those
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
those uh tears um that was at the time
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
was rationalized is that that maybe this
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
will help
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
the prohibition but um i think that
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
andrew klein's
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh letter editorial was right on the
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
money when it said was
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
no it was really just to protect those
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
three different indian
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
and and protect their little monopolies
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't think anybody wants to
 
02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:28.470 align:start position:0%
and i don't think anybody wants to
promote

02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
promote
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
monopolies um the idea that we're going
 
02:15:32.079 --> 02:15:32.790 align:start position:0%
monopolies um the idea that we're going
to

02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
um you know pause and see whether we
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
revisit go back to monopoly or go back
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
to some three-tier
 
02:15:42.310 --> 02:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh limitations i i that does not make
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
sense to me either
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
um so i i i caution everyone
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of what this bill is this is
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
you could say this was a
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
coven bill by the way because this was
 
02:15:53.679 --> 02:15:54.310 align:start position:0%
coven bill by the way because this was
uh

02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
the senator when it was working with the
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh the the beer
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
the beverage manufacturers and saying
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
what can we do to help your industry
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
and some of these items were identified
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
in a report
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
that the liquor commission did um you
 
02:16:10.229 --> 02:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
know it's going
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
on about six or seven eight years ago
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
and some of these items were in that
 
02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:14.709 align:start position:0%
and some of these items were in that
list

02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
um so these are issues that are being
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
addressed the restaurant and hospitality
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
all due respect you know they're there
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
they were trying to protect
 
02:16:26.709 --> 02:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
their tier was they didn't like the idea
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
they never liked the idea that beverage
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
were selling beer and serving
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
beer right because in their minds on the
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
three tier
 
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're the only ones allowed to
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
serve beer okay
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
and because they they're the only ones
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
with the with the on-premise license and
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
nobody else
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
should be able to do it and that's
 
02:16:47.669 --> 02:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
protectionist and that's monopoly
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
i mean you know not necessarily a good
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
idea but
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
we made the decision and i believe it
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
was uh you democrats who
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
it was you were in the majority of the
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
time that you give
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
a one winery that the idea that they
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
could have
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
one retail location and
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
um i personally you know point out
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's a violation of the three tier
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
but i was willing to go along with
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
because i think that it is appropriate
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
that once we made the decision then we
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
want to allow uh
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
liquor beverage manufacturers or wine or
 
02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:19.349 align:start position:0%
liquor beverage manufacturers or wine or
whatever

02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to have tasting rooms and
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to give people to
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
get that product
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
you have to taste it and buy it from
 
02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
those locations
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
that it might make sense that somebody
 
02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:32.150 align:start position:0%
that it might make sense that somebody
might

02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
might be in the zoning with the
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
community doesn't think it's a good idea
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
that they have that parking and traffic
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
or whatever consumers coming in there
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
and that maybe it's better to have a
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
different location
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh for them to do that tasting room so
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
um i was willing to go along with one
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
and one is one um and i know that the
 
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant hospitality is concerned that
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
old camel's nose are in the tent and
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
once you have one then you know
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
what's to stop you from then going to
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
10. and uh
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that i have no
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
intention to vote
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
for more than one and and that's and
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
that was reassuring for them
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
and that's why their position and on the
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
bill has changed
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
but that they're still fearful of that
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know that someone
 
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
that would take away their special
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
privilege which is that they are the
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
only ones allowed to serve liquor
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
so um i can all i can ask is
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
is that if you can really show me
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
something in here
 
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
that really needs to be fixed or whether
 
02:18:28.709 --> 02:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
i feel the bill was well worked over
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
we really fine-tuned it um and
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i think we've done a good product
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
and that's why i had another hearing
 
02:18:36.790 --> 02:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we're all
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know okay with it so unless we can
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
really find issues that are blatantly a
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
problem that need to be fixed
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
um i i think retaining it is not a good
 
02:18:45.599 --> 02:18:47.270 align:start position:0%
um i i think retaining it is not a good
idea

02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i'll let you have the last word honey
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
and i do defer to your ex your expertise
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
on this and we've worked
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
collegially together for years on liquor
 
02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:56.870 align:start position:0%
collegially together for years on liquor
bills

02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
um the primary point that i'd like to
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
simply leave us with is the idea that
 
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
cut and paste
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't always give us a chance to look
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
at doing things better
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
taking a step back and looking we've got
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
a bill here with direct shipping in it
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
and we've got
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
samples that can be up to a quart
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot going on here and i
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
think there might be a lot of value here
 
02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
but let's take a step back and let's not
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
just cut and paste the whole time let's
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
take a look and look at the
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
at the entire structure let's not play
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
the jenga game
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh try to see which you know which piece
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
will be pulled out and toppled and
 
02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:27.349 align:start position:0%
will be pulled out and toppled and
structured

02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
structured
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
that's my request thank you well i i
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
certainly would give the charge to the
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
blicker subcommittee
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
to spend some time and and try to
 
02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:37.270 align:start position:0%
to spend some time and and try to
identify

02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
identify
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
how they would try to rewrite the liquor
 
02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:41.349 align:start position:0%
how they would try to rewrite the liquor
statute

02:19:41.349 --> 02:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
in a way that uh that works better but i
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
i'm telling you
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
i attempted that a couple of times but i
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
had my head handed to him but
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
i would say at this point um it is uh
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
as byzantine as it looks um it is it's
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
an awkward situation but
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
um it's you know it's this and zoning
 
02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
are the only mother may i laws that we
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
have so
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%

02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh having no more hands up will the
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%

02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
this brings uh investing in commodities
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
such as precious metals and
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
other other uh items of value
 
02:26:19.110 --> 02:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
into the 21st century
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
it changes the definition of
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh it actually adds a definition
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
that allows commodities to be uh instead
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the person
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
receiving them so instead of ordering
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
let's say gold or silver online and
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
having to receive it
 
02:26:41.429 --> 02:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
physically to your residence or
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
someplace that you control
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
this allows for a delivery to be made to
 
02:26:48.309 --> 02:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
a depository
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
storage facility that's licensed and
 
02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:55.190 align:start position:0%
storage facility that's licensed and
regulated

02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
and that'll count as the purchaser
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
having received it as physical delivery
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we had some testimony uh
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this bill that this is
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
common practice in other states
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
and that we need to update new
 
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire's laws to allow this
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
if you have a significant amount of gold
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
or silver
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
in your physical residence you're at
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
risk that someone might
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
break in and seal it from you you have
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
to provide your own
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
security by allowing it to be delivered
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
to a physical
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
depository who does that for uh you know
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
as a business model they have increased
 
02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:35.030 align:start position:0%
as a business model they have increased
security

02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
security
 
02:27:37.349 --> 02:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
and uh that takes some of the risk off
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
of uh citizens that are engaged in this
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
so uh with all those reasons i move all
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
the best on
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
my question is you you mentioned silver
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
and gold
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
for representative ammon for the sponsor
 
02:28:14.479 --> 02:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
for representative ammon for the sponsor
bill

02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative herbert uh and uh
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know the answer is uh it talks about
 
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
investment gems investment medals
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's all in the uh in the bill itself
 
02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:27.110 align:start position:0%
it's all in the uh in the bill itself
right

02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
so if it's an investment type metal
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm pretty sure people don't
 
02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
choose aluminum as an investment metal
 
02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
where you can do platinum but platinum
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
would definitely be in
 
02:28:42.790 --> 02:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
platinum gold and you know anything that
 
02:28:43.270 --> 02:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and and then also when they talked
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
about the gems
 
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
definitely had a feeling that this was
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
kind of metals that would be used for
 
02:28:50.399 --> 02:28:51.270 align:start position:0%
kind of metals that would be used for
jewelry

02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
jewelry
 
02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so another question
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
for the question questions to get my
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
mind clear this
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
um so in effect this is an operational
 
02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
type of
 
02:29:05.830 --> 02:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows
 
02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with stocks and bonds but
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
somebody else is holding the paper
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
right so this allows storage storage to
 
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh sort of automatically at a place that
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
you do business with
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
correct and but out of state in order
 
02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
correct and but out of state in order
that

02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't an in-state problem it was
 
02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state problem
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
that so if you're if you're if you're
 
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
buying a
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
chunk of metal and it's in california
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense to ship it in new
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire just to
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
have it for a period of time until you
 
02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
decide what you're going to do with it
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
so that you can leave it there in
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
california okay thank you
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes we can um
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the text for sb 138
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
and the website
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
says that this is uh relative to
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
consumer protections against
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
profiteering and necessity so i support
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
one bill and not the other
 
02:30:07.270 --> 02:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
so when i talk to legislative services
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
and and there's been a
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
a difference between one version of a
 
02:30:14.550 --> 02:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
bill and another they go by what's on
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
the website
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
and what's on the website is is this
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill by
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh senator sherman um
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
and it's it's the one saying you
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't uh
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
increase prices and there were some
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
structural problems with that bill so
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering um if we're voting on 130
 
02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:31.590 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering um if we're voting on 130
sb

02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
sb
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
138 which is what you're looking at was
 
02:30:37.270 --> 02:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
the underlying the original underlying
 
02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:38.230 align:start position:0%
the underlying the original underlying
bill

02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
um in advertising it says as
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
introduced but what we're looking at is
 
02:30:45.439 --> 02:30:45.910 align:start position:0%
introduced but what we're looking at is
this

02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay i don't i don't have the text of
 
02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:55.030 align:start position:0%
okay i don't i don't have the text of
that

02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
i was able to bring it up off the gen
 
02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
court website go to gen court type in
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
sb 138 and then i pulled up the pdf
 
02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:02.389 align:start position:0%
sb 138 and then i pulled up the pdf
version

02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
version
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
and i have it from yeah if i if if i
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure how you're searching
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know but yeah
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
when i because i always go to the
 
02:31:10.469 --> 02:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
committee and i see bills
 
02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative mclaren um just
 
02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:19.429 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative mclaren um just
to

02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh maybe uh talk to uh
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
mr herbert uh representative herbert
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
this is really exactly like if you had a
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
at a stock bond account at merrill lynch
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
or any other
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh you you probably wouldn't take
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
receipt of the stocks
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
in this case it's a little bit um
 
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
very similar and the reason you don't
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
want to take receipt
 
02:31:46.150 --> 02:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
is if you have these precious metals in
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
an ira
 
02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
account or a 401k account and if you
 
02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:50.790 align:start position:0%
account or a 401k account and if you
took

02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
took
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
receipt of them you put yourself in a
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
taxable position so you don't want that
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
so it's convenient for for somebody
 
02:31:58.800 --> 02:31:59.910 align:start position:0%
so it's convenient for for somebody
investing

02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
investing
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
just with not qualified money but it's
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
an absolute mandate
 
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
for folks that are investing with
 
02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
qualified money you don't want to take
 
02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
constructive receipt
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
because you'd have to pay taxes on thank
 
02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:11.910 align:start position:0%
because you'd have to pay taxes on thank
you

02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
interesting okay
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.870 --> 02:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
