e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
we will get started and um what I wanted
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
to do just to kind of start us on the
 
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
right foot even though we're a little
 
00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
bit short-handed but we can do it anyway
 
00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
you got it okay all right so what you
 
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
one hey Johan
 
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
okay are we there y okay so this is um
 
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch and in particular
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
Senate and um if you look for 2024 they
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually spent
 
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
2,928 uh
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
1,863 but they are budgeted for these
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
two years of
 
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
3,548 th000 right so uh
 
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
roughly something over what is this
 
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.029 align:start position:0%
roughly something over what is this
580,000

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
more is that
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
right a lot more
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah what about us actually sorry it's
 
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
it's 600,000
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
more right 620,000 more and we're
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
level um yeah we'll we'll get to the
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
house oh the house curious what right so
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
the house well the house is is sort of
 
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
600,000 more but on a bigger number
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
right right right okay and maybe we'll
 
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
cut them later but I just thought kind
 
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
of as our first thing and and to try to
 
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.029 align:start position:0%
of as our first thing and and to try to
get

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
us heading on the right step that I
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
would propose a
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
page so there would still be 120 more
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
than they actually spend in
 
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
2024 do you have any yes represent of
 
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
eil thank you do you have any idea what
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the additional that they have
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
here yes you can see it's in the
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
personal I just okay sorry I didn't
 
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
track back up I I'll admit I hadn't
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
studied this page right so it's it's
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's all
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
in well it's not kind of all but it's
 
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 align:start position:0%
it's mostly in
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
Personnel right representative Maguire
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
yes Melissa in order to make the cuts um
 
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
we need to know line items and where you
 
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
would like to cut
 
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
so although you say $500,000 we would
 
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
need to know if you want that as a
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
percentage for each class item or how
 
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
you want to divy that up well it's going
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
to be personnel and
 
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 align:start position:0%
benefits right so
 
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
guess we'd want the Personnel to be
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
level with this
 
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.550 align:start position:0%
level with this
1825

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
right and then the benefits would would
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
one um this chair starts at the
 
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
beginning yeah and we could also I mean
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
there's also instate travel right that
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
lower and out of state travel that could
 
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.350 align:start position:0%
lower and out of state travel that could
be

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
low anyways um so I guess maybe we can
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
ask you to come up with plan that would
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
cut that would make it 500,000 lower
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
roughly does that
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
work yeah as long as you give us
 
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
Direction so if you're giving us
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
direction for those uh yeah so the lines
 
00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
would be class 16
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:25.909 align:start position:0%
 
80

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
okay so we can we can spread that out
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have a spreadsheet for
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
you which will be part of keeping track
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
of hb1 and then when it's all um
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
allocated out then we can do a vote
 
00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:45.670 align:start position:0%
allocated out then we can do a vote
right

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
um because it looks to me like the the
 
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.149 align:start position:0%
um because it looks to me like the the
2156

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
2156
 
00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
million is just copied from fiscal year
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
2025 authorized it's not the actual
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
employees that are there in the 1.8
 
00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:05.070 align:start position:0%
employees that are there in the 1.8
million

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
right so I think this goes to a couple
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
of things we were emailing about with
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
the difference in cost you have the
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
employee raise factored into that you
 
00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
have positions are very fluid so in the
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
sense that there could have been some
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
vacant positions in fiscal year 25 24
 
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
that are now filled in fiscal year 25 so
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
maybe at this point the Senate assumed
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
that they were at full capacity with
 
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
positions so they're funding now at the
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
level of what they have for 25 what we
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
don't know in these numbers is how much
 
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.230 align:start position:0%
don't know in these numbers is how much
is

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
unfunded um how much is unfunded vacant
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
positions and how much is filled
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
positions so that
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
500,000 could potentially be positions
 
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:52.519 align:start position:0%
let let me put it this way it that
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
column that says fisal year of 2025
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized that was created two
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
correct no no so this is a point in time
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
that this I don't know the exact date I
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
could get that of when um the adjusted
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
authorized but that is a closer
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
reflection of a point in time of what 25
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
looked like and how they would close it
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
was not what was created if it was what
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
was created um two years ago it would
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
have been the budgeted number from two
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
years ago but instead this adjusted
 
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
authorized means any carry forwards from
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
24 of dollars that were unspent any
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal items that were approved any hb2
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
items that hit 25 but didn't hit 24 any
 
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
Appropriations um and what so this is
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
this is a more accurate thing of what
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
they think is going to end this year yes
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
with the current employees Etc correct
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
because it's a point in time the closest
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
point in time in the budget that they
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
actually had gotcha all right so so my
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
idea is not good I have a question yes
 
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.150 align:start position:0%
idea is not good I have a question yes
um

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
are these numbers all General funds or
 
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
is that all funds together these are all
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
General funds yeah okay the Senate is
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
all General
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
funds I see so you're
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
thinking all right so all right
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
fine I did I did have a Reason by the
 
00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:24.519 align:start position:0%
way um because the the Senate every one
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
of them has
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
staff and in the old days when we had
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
joint committees chaired by a senator
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
their staff would would U provide
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
services for the committee but they have
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
since changed their um procedures so
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
that even when they're chairing a joint
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
committee they no longer provide staff
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
for that committee all right so they
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't need as much staff as they used
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
to so anyways all right we will skip
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
this and we will move on to retirement
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
go

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay so I
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
I is there any kind of presentation you
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
want to give us because very briefly
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
because I I had I just wrote questions
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
based on what I'm seeing in the book
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
here so um yes we handed out um a
 
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.910 align:start position:0%
here so um yes we handed out um a
presentation

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
believe yeah but this is similar to what
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
we had before
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
right there are no there are budget
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
schedules in there and me just there are
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
some highlights which kind of May repeat
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
some of the things we said before but
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
there are some budget schedules
 
00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:15.629 align:start position:0%

presentations we have two handouts a
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
budget overview with highlights
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
initiatives strategic challenges and a
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
highlevel budget outline and a copy of
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
our strategic planning document which
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
will speak to our goals the nhrs
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
statutory administrative budget which
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
does not include any funding from the
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
general fund encompasses all internal
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
non-investment related Administration
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
costs including projected it costs at
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
full value our statutory administrative
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
operating budget for fy2 is 13.6 million
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
and our budgets for fisal years 26 and
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
27 are 19.3 million and 19 .5 million
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
respectively based on fully Staffing all

board authorized positions these amounts
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
do not include General funds recomended
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
by the governor to cover group two
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
benefit changes nhs's budget was created
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
as part of a three-year strategic plan
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
to address deferred initiatives in areas
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
put on hold over the past five years due
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
to the focus on the major upgrade to our
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
20-year-old pension Administration
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
software the increase is primarily
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
driven by it upgrades modernization
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
projects and salaries and benefits to
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
support new staff positions aligned with
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
the Strategic
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
plan as you probably know the New
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system is not an
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency but is a
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
statutorily created pension trust
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
although its expenses flow through the
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
state those costs are reimbursed from
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
the retirement trust which is in turn
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
funded by contributions from employers
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
and members and and investment Returns
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
the budget is before you today has been
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
fully vetted and adopted by our Board of
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
Trustees who are responsible for
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
approving a budget which is appropriate
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
for the system before I go into greater
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
detail on the operations of the oper
 
00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:19.759 align:start position:0%
retirement system I would like to share
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
these key facts and HRS provides a
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
modest pension benefit these benefits
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
help support the New Hampshire economy
 
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
and there's a plan in place to pay down
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
the unfunded
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
liability and the trustees continue to
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
strengthen the plan by adopting revised
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions recommended by our
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
actuaries and so at this point I will
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
turn to our budget document which you
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
you just a few highlights that we had
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
discussed last time to reinforce um
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
earlier I'm on page three of the handout
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
um the board certified the employer
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
contribution rates for fiscal years 26
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
and 27 and this was the second
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
consecutive 2-year rate cycle which has
 
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
seen a decrease in employer contribution
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
rates we um issued our June 30 2024
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
financial statements and the gby 68 and
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
70 reports 75 reports with unmodified
 
00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:22.150 align:start position:0%
70 reports 75 reports with unmodified
clean

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
clean
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
opinions on page four you can see the
 
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
continued positive trajectory of our
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
funded ratio and at the same time our un
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is continuing to be
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
amortised we on page five we realized an
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
88.8% return on investments which SE um
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
and that translate into US performing
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
better than 70% of our peers over the
 
00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.069 align:start position:0%
better than 70% of our peers over the
past

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
decade on page
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
six we ramped the strategic planning
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
process and developed a three-year
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
strategic plan for fiscal years 25 and
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
27 which is in your materials the board
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
also agreed to modify the fund's asset
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
allocation reducing the allocation to
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
Global equities from 50% to 40% and
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
increasing the allocation of to private
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
credit by 5% and allocating 5% to
 
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.669 align:start position:0%
credit by 5% and allocating 5% to
private

00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and we continue to
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
maintain and expand cyber security
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
enhancements to protect the security of
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
our system as well as our members and
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
retirees personal
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
information page seven so what's ahead
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
of us we want to build on our pension
 
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
Administration system implementation by
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring member and employer service
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
levels and developing a long-term plan
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
for future service enhancements and we
 
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
continue to review and adjust as needed
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
the Investment Portfolio to meet or
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
exceed the Retirement Systems assumed

rate of return of 6.7% 5% over the long
 
00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:02.919 align:start position:0%

risk return and
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
liquidity as you all know there's been
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
many bills in the last few years which
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
have affected nhrs there were eight
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
bills that were implemented in the
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
2023 24 legislative session and several
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
budget part of the presentation and I
 
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
will now turn the floor to Marie Mullen
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
our Director of
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
Finance thank you very much on page
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
eight um we have um actuals for the last
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
three years 2022 23 and 24 as you can
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
see we had our actual expenditures
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
remained fairly flat the increases we
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
had were primarily related to our
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
pension gold upgrade um that was our
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
five plus year uh pension system upgrade
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
that we completed last
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
year on page nine um just some
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
highlights of the the operating budget
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
um again as executive director Goodwin
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned the budget was approved by the
 
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
Trustees uh the governor's recommended
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
budget did include General funds related
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
to the hb2 provision for group two
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
members that included 5 million in
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 and 27.9 million in
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 27 those are the only
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
General funds um in our budget at this
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
time um we created our budget as part of
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
our three-year strategic plan um again
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
as executive director Goodwin mentioned
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
um we had put several initiatives and
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
upgrades on hold due to the um for the
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
past five years to focus on our pension
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
upgrade and this budget reflects some of
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
those overdue projects that need to be
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
updated and completed to ensure Superior
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
Service to our members and also security
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
as um was mentioned
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
earlier so the two-year budget um of
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
71.6 million includes a 78% increase o
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 26 over fiscal year 2025
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
and a 95% increase for fiscal year 2027
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
over fiscal year
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
2026 that's primarily driven by the
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
group two benefit changes it upgrades
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
modernization projects and salaries and
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
benefits to support new staff positions
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
aligned with the Strategic plan so if
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
you turn to page 10 we have um a general
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
overview of the budget that we submitted
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
for our agency budget and then as a
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
comparison against the governor's budget
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
the only change um in the governor's
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
budget was in line 12 in the retiree
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and those were the general
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
funds that were added um for the group
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
two benefits um change that is in
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
hb2 um 5 million was added in fiscal
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
year 2026 again in 27.9 million in
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
2027 um on line two our salaries and
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
benefits um we do see an increase there
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
that is related to uh wage
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
increases and also new positions um
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
primarily in it we have several new
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
positions around security movement to
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
the cloud um and project managers to
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
support um some of the the new the
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
delayed initiatives that we had for our
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
technology and software technology
 
00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:36.039 align:start position:0%
software and Hardware line on line four
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
the increase there is primarily for
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
projects again that were delayed due to
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
PG that um includes moving to Microsoft
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
cloud um we have additional pension gold
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
enhancements and maintenance of the
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
current system for pension gold as well
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
as an upgrade to our website um we are
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
looking to do a mobile app for our um
 
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
members and also an upgrade to our
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
financial software um which is uh a 2017
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
version and is no longer being supported
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
by Microsoft so we need to upgrade that
 
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.470 align:start position:0%
by Microsoft so we need to upgrade that
as

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
as
well

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
um I will open it up to the committee
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
now for any questions so
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
so this um salary and benefits I mean
 
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
this is a huge increase here
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
um of uh 25% or something like that is
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
that what how many more employees how
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
many employees do you have now and how
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
currently and we are adding nine
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
positions in 2026 and three in
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
2027 and again those positions are
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
primarily it around to ensure security
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
so that's to the movement to the cloud
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh project manager position a business
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
analyst these are all things with the
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
the new software that we had we did not
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
have the right Staffing in this area and
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
now we're trying to improve that so that
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
we can maintain our systems security and
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
those type of
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
things representative C thank you Mr
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
chair what's the justification for the
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
health care going up 500% in
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
2027 I I no no this is the sor
 
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
I'll answer this this is the group two
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
enhancements this is not the stuff in
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
yellow yeah is not real that that's part
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
of that's the extra money for for the
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
police and fire retirement system right
 
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
the the the governor all right okay so
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
what happened was in our previous two
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
years ago in our budget we had a big
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
increase for for the retirement system
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
of police fire and Corrections okay
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate cut that in half they took
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
only the employees that were in the
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
system like 10 plus years okay but they
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
avoided giving anything to current
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
employees or the younger employees this
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
is for those employees right so it's not
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
but their real budget is this 41%
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
increase right so that's the extra 12
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
employees on top of 78 plus plus uh um
 
00:24:29.399 --> 00:24:30.669 align:start position:0%
employees on top of 78 plus plus uh um
salary

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
salary
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
increases yes okay is that correct yes
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
right so so you're getting new software
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
and that new software is causing you to
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
spend even more
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
employees more money on employees right
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
I mean isn't software supposed to make
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
things easier I think the the the new
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
employees are to support current systems
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
as well we identified that the current
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
Staffing we have for the the systems
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
that we have with the new upgrade we did
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
we did not have sufficient funding so
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
this is right sizing that but then also
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
with the new applications that are
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
coming on being able to support that we
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
do have temporary funding in here as
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
well so we recognize that some of these
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
projects are shortterm and that we only
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
need folks to help support the
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
implementation so we have some temporary
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
that would then be released like
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
temporary um help or Consultants so we
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
do not not we are not fully Staffing to
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
to complete all of this and then have to
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
lay off folks this is what we deem we
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
need to be able to
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
maintain the systems um appropriately to
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
be able to handle the the new um
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
products the new security requirements
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
the changes that come with it constantly
 
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
that need to be monitored to make sure
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
the funds of our retirees are secure and
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
safe as well represent
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
run thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
as far as the Staffing
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
goes did you look at instead of putting
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
someone on the payroll as a as an
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
employee did you look at maybe having
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
positions um yes as um Finance
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
director um
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
Mullen um stated in in her commentary
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
whenever possible we look to see is this
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
a long-term need or a short-term need
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then um build the project
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
accordingly so we do have there will be
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
some temporary employees and also we
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
there are some employees that we will be
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
needing on a permanent
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
basis yes go ahead okay so the um nine
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
employees you're adding in 26 and the
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
three that you're adding in 27 do those
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
include those temporary employees those
 
00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:49.149 align:start position:0%
include those temporary employees those
are

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
full-time they would be um group one I
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
would assume corre they would all be all
 
00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
the employees at nhrs are group one okay
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
thank you so roughly how much um money
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
is given to you uh for uh employ for
 
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.870 align:start position:0%
is given to you uh for uh employ for
retirement

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
year all the retirement you know the the
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
all the payments employer and
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
employee for all all of all over um it's
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
approximately $900
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
million okay so um so your expenses on
 
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
that 900 million are are 20
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
19 is that what we're talking about here
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
so those are administrative expenses but
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
we have um also the investment side that
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
is not included in here so we have
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
investment we have Investment Management
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
fees those other pieces so when you look
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
at the administrative costs compared to
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
all of our fees and costs it's less than
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
1% of the fees are related to our
 
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.549 align:start position:0%
1% of the fees are related to our
administrative

00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
costs overall in the
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
system your administrative costs are 2%
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
total being invested every year yeah
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's not 2% of of the Corpus right but
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
it's 2% of the activity sort of so
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
you're you're only taking into account
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
the contributions you're not taking into
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
account the investment gains as as well
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
right we have our the investment
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
as well and the investment gains from
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
the system as well yeah but that doesn't
 
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
cause administrative expense so all
 
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.430 align:start position:0%
cause administrative expense so all
right

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
um okay so let's talk about the uh the
 
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
the group two enhancements why is it
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
year that is a good
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
question you don't know we do not know
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
right um go ahead repr again this was
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
the the governor's this was the
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget Who would
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
know because it's quite because it's
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to be for the full year isn't
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
it or you don't know yeah this was the
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
budget so the her budget director would
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
be the one that would know where the
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
yes so in your budget in fiscal year
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
2024 actual Personnel Services
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
non-benefit was 7
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
million 7, 236,000 what what was that
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
for and it now it's going down to
 
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.630 align:start position:0%
for and it now it's going down to
essentially

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
155 um
 
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
okay that um is related to um a TSA 7.1
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
million was related to the $500 one-time
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
payment that the um legislature that was
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
approved in law um so so that was a cola
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
yeah so the way yeah the way the state
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
has to transfer the funds they put it
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
through our operating budget so that's
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
why that looks so large thank you other
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lehman
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman good morning so a
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
followup to the Chairman's question
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
about the $5 million what about the 20
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
what $9 million or what 27 million do
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
you have any idea where that number came
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
from or is that the governor's number as
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
well um that is also the govern's number
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
um it's our understanding that this is
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
from the um the video Lottery terminals
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
a share of that
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue haven't been proved yet correct
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
okay but all right thank you thank you
 
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:02.950 align:start position:0%
okay but all right thank you thank you
Mr

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
chairman now that I don't understand
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
because this is an expense I think I
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
no for for Mr chair it is the group to
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
expense but there is a bill um Senate
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
Bill 83 which would provide for um
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
Revenue being um dedicated a portion of
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
the revenue from the video
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
Lottery terminals would be directed to
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
NH HRS but that's not in here because
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
funds yeah I believe the the bill as
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
written in hb2 directs the video Lottery
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
terminals to those funds to be directed
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
to the general fund there's nothing
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
specific that it gets directed to nhrs
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
sure um in the hb2 bill for the group
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
two benefits it does state that 2 7.5
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
million per year for 10 years would be
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
directed would go to in general funds to
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
the retirement system I'm not sure why
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
this is 27.9 but we're assuming that
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's based on that 27 a. half million
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
from the the bill that was as it was
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
presented okay all right any other
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
R thank you Mr chair um there's a line
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
here um it was on training employee
 
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.870 align:start position:0%
here um it was on training employee
training

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
um is that for the software or why oh
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
okay um the employee training is um It's
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
a combination of items for our for our
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
staff so we have um we allow them you
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
know folks to have training to better
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
them their selves what they may need to
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
do their jobs at nhrs we also provide um
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
college assistance College tuition
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
assistance for employees um as well as
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
attending conferences again to better
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
themselves so okay so that training
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
includes College yes oh okay um follow
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I'm just wondering so those
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
seem pretty consistent that should be
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
consistent year-over-year but there is
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
an increase um you know 100,000 over 24
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's proposed for
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
26 um why why is that
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
jump so during our pension gold upgrade
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
um for a year year and a half we had
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
during 2024 we had a moratorium on folks
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
being able to go to training take
 
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
training um and some of these you know
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
folks were working so they didn't take
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
their education classes so they've been
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
kind of delaying that as well so this is
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
um for folks we're now seeing starting
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
to um initiate and act take additional
 
00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:46.519 align:start position:0%
training again going to classes and that
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
type of thing so we're anticipating that
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
increase since we had had that
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
moratorium um during the pension gold
 
00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
upgrade okay thank you so Melissa are we
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
authorized to change this I mean if if
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
we don't to have 12 new employees just
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
six or something like that or not you
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
are authorized to change their budget I
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
see okay representative
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
wer I'm looking through here to find the
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
rates the employer pays for police and
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
fire in group two and I don't see him
 
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:42.950 align:start position:0%
fire in group two and I don't see him
here

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
right um Mr chair um representative um

31.2% for police and
 
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:11.069 align:start position:0%
31.2% for police and
30.354701

00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
15% for
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
no and the the employee Shares are still
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
yes the employee share for police is
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
11.55% and for fire it's
 
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.710 align:start position:0%
11.55% and for fire it's
11.8%

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
11.8%
 
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.589 align:start position:0%
11.8%
11.8

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
11.8
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
that it's out of line there should be
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
more of a
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
sharing with all that
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
cost yeah so that's like 40% total and
 
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
then you then you put the health
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
insurance on top of that
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
and it's over
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
50% benefits
 
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
line probably
 
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
60% all right so I I don't think we'll
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
make any decisions about this budget
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%

Community Development block
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
grants the illustration that looks like
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
an arrow sort of describes how these
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
block grants come to New Hampshire the
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
funding is allocated from HUD to cdfa
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
cdfa then Awards those funds to a
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
municipality and then the municipality
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
often Works alongside a subrecipient to
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
administer the funds and ultimately they
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
benefit individuals across all of our
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
communities for more than 20 years cdfa
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
has provided the state with an
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
exceptionally coste effective system for
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
administering these Federal resources
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
the cdbg program is uh focused on
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
developing viable sustainable
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%

00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities the picture with the map
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
on it shows all of the communities in
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
red that received Community Development

assistance to over 540 small
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
businesses I'll illustrate a couple of
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
those projects now as a flavor of what
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
the block grants do um can we skip more
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
to uh numbers yeah
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
please so our budget requests um is
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
280,000 each year for two 2026 and 2027
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
a total request of $560,000
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
which is approximately
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
2.9% which allows us to provide the
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
technical assistance guidance
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
Contracting and other administrative
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
requirements of the federal funds to
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
leverage around $19 million we received
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
the exact amount annually uh into New
 
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.109 align:start position:0%
the exact amount annually uh into New
Hampshire's

00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's

communities I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
your questions about the budget request
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
or any of the information that I
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
presented so so the match is only 3% or
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
something is that
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ms and then
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative W thank you thank thank
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and um sorry I joined
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
your joined you late um so if I
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
understand correctly if we don't make
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
this um if we if we don't provide
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
funding for $560,000 we would lose this
 
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
$19 million Federal allocation that's
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
correct and wouldn't and would therefore
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
not be able to make the kind of
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
investments in the community that we've
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
been doing okay thank thank you
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
so is there any followup on these
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
projects to ensure that they are
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
completed as requested yes absolutely so
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
we do a desk monitoring and then we do
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
actually an on-site monitoring where we
 
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
ensure not only that the projects
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
completed but that also it meets all the
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
federal requirements because we are
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
audited in ually a financial audit and
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
then we're also audited by the federal
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
government to ensure that the funds are
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
appropriately expended in community so
 
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
we want to support municipalities often
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
they're volunteer staff and they need
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
the support to be able to use federal
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
funds so we provide them that training
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
and then we do the monitoring to ensure
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
that they've met all the requirements
 
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chair how many
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
employees do you have we have 18 18 are
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
they all full-time uh no no what do you
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
know what the breakout is uh 16
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
full-time and uh two part-time okay yep
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
so I thought you said that our part is
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
the administrative cost right so this
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay for 18 we administer other
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
programs as well state tax credit
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
program the Community Development tax
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
credit program as well as some loan
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
programs and other things that the state
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
needs us to do in order to create uh
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
viable communities support that's not
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
part of the $9 million I see thank you
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
represent of you I see you've uh
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
supported a lot of housing projects but
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
I was wondering how you um what your
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
prioritization is in your Grant making
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
or or or what the process is um and just
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
as a general comment I think that this
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
money is incredibly well leveraged thank
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
you so much so every year uh we actually
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
have public hearings to give input into
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
our prioritization and then there's a
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
scoring system it's both uh quantitative
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
as well as qualitative data that creates
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
that scoring it's publicly available um
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
the scoring so all applicants will know
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
what that scoring criteria is before
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
they apply and then it gets adjusted as
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
the conditions change and the data
 
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
suggests uh that different priorities
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
should be made but there's a definite
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
focus on housing as well as public
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
facilities which are things like uh
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
Child Care Facilities nonprofit Child
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
Care fac facilities would be considered
 
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
I don't yet representative MCH so again
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
forgive me it's it's early still and
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
I've only had one cup of coffee
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
um I I I guess I'm I'm confused there's
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
you said you have 18 employees but I
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in the budget detail
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
that indicates that you have any
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
positions right so we're a Public
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
Authority so we're an independent
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofit but you provide this um
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
required State match and then on behalf
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the state we administer through
 
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.630 align:start position:0%
of the state we administer through
contract

00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah and so the the the
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
$280,000 that um you'll you get I mean
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
what is that used for so it's for all
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
the staff that provide the uh guidance
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
to to um applicants that do the
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
monitoring that do the payments it's for
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
our systems so we actually leverage the
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
staff across all the programs um so that
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's a portion of those activities and
 
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
we're putting activities of Community
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
Development together to be sure that we
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
can do all that all those pie okay so
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
that's why it's kind of cost effective
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
is because it's not only for the block
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
grant program but we're able to have one
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
staff person who's dedicated for
 
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
instance to Federal monitoring but is
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
doing that learning that activity and
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
then doing across a couple different
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
program areas but that can't possibly
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
cover all your administrative costs so
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
some of them some of those
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are coming out of
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
the federal money correct um so there is
 
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh some federal money that goes for the
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
administrative cost but we also
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
administer other programs so it's the
 
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
fees together that cover our our staff
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay all right so uh representative eel
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a motion thank you
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um Mr chair um based
 
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
on the presentation that was given the
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
incredible leveraging that is possible
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
through this program um I think it's a
 
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
great benefit to the state and I'd like
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
to move that we accept uh their budget
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
as presented and if I need more detail
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%

presentation session by The Liquor

Commission uh that can be found on page

the New Hampshire Liquor Commission and
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%

deir representative Maguire just handed
 
01:01:08.109 --> 01:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
us some questions so we'd be happy to go
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
through those first if you'd like that
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
would be great thank you okay thank
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
you um first the handout that we
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
provided good morning the handout that
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
we provided um is just to show the
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
difference between what we propos for
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
cuts and what are in the governor's
 
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
budget um they took all of the cuts that
 
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
we recommended except for when going
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
through the numbers um we found that a
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
couple of the numbers provided by doit
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
they had already accounted for one
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
position in the agency phase so when
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
they provided the number to us it
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't be reduced again and then there
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
were two positions that they provided
 
01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:52.839 align:start position:0%
funding for us about 300,000 and those
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
positions aren't actually direct to
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
liquor they're actually Statewide doit
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
positions so we couldn't reduce them
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
from our budget so you'll see that the
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
numbers that we proposed and the
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
different yes representative mons thank
 
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
you so the um and thank you for being
 
01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
here and taking my question so the the
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
governor's budget numbers include those
 
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
positions is that correct well the the
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
two positions are Statewide so they're
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
not actually in Liquor's budget so we
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't cut them and then the other
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
position they already cut in our budget
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
in um the agency phase so they were
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
already reduced prior
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
to so the positions weren't exclusive to
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
liquor so we can't take them out of our
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
project there we have some direct
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
positions from doit and then there are
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
the shared positions so we couldn't take
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
the funding for those positions that
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
they identified originally as positions
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
for us and those the shared positions
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
represent I I guess I'm trying to
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
um so the the governor's budget had for
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
for doit has $500,000 more than what you
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
had proposed correct and and that and is
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
that $500,000 those positions correct
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
you really don't want them they're not
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
really part of yours but that's where
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
they ended
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
up is that correct yeah yeah okay thanks
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
just quick question so the 528 104 like
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at here that's your share of
 
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
the shared
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
positions is that the number I'm looking
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
under doit like difference to the agency
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
FY the 512 or yeah and the five okay
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
right 528 and 528 those your share the
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
Liquor's share of the shared positions
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
no what DOI he did was they gave us the
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
numbers like they were positions that
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
were direct reports to liquor and they
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
weren't so we couldn't reduce them from
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
our budget because they're actually
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
Statewide shared positions gotcha so
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with it in the doit
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
budget okay
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
gotcha yes representative water but are
 
01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
you in fact paying for the shared
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
positions totally no no we're only
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
paying for our share of three people
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
they reduced one they they took one out
 
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
in the agency phase so we're no longer
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
paying for that one that one was already
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
reduced and then they're removing the
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
positions in the doit funding so we
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
won't have to be paying a share for
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
those positions but it seems Seems
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
expensive for three people
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
500,000 yeah thank you oh that's
 
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.269 align:start position:0%
 
benefits

01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
okay so the questions that we have in
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
front of us um the first one expenses up
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
16% or 16 million over uh 24 actual um
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
look that is because we started um
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
budgeting for the transfer for HHS
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
whereas before it was a transfer number
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
after our revenues we actually stuck it
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
in our I shouldn't say stuck we put it
 
01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
in our budget um so if you go to page
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
1030 if you go to page
 
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
315 you'll see um class 49 transfers to
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
other state
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
agencies we included the 17.8 million in
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
24 which was the actual transfer and
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
then you have the estimates for 25 26
 
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
and 27 so that's the increase because it
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't a line a budget line item in the
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
past it was a transfer after our
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
revenues so to make it clear and visible
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
we put it into the
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
budget for many many years it was kind
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
kind of tough accounting on it so Tina
 
01:05:59.789 --> 01:05:59.799 align:start position:0%
decided to put it in that way and I
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
agreed with her that way we can clearly
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
see those numbers as their as their line
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
item now in the
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
budget uh page 304 oh sorry Mr
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative MZ so so what
 
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
is that for you you said something about
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
HHS those are the transfers to HHS for
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
the two transfer laws um the first one
 
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
is the 17616 which is 5% of our prior
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
year gross profit transferred to the
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund and then the other one is
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
the 126 AA which is for granted
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
advantage and that's based on numbers um
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
so the next question was on page 304 are
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
we done with consultants and the answer
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
to that is yes we had brought on
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
Consultants to H help with the um
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
d365 system in the transition and we
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
brought back uh a couple of the part-
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
timers to help with our old system to
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
our new system and now that we have
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
transitioned we would no longer be using
 
01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:25.990 align:start position:0%
transitioned we would no longer be using
Consultants

01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement salaries up 20% from 2024
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
this is on page
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
305 so we have um we had reported in our
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
in our last presentation that uh class
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
50 went up we brought on part-time
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
positions for our loss prevention
 
01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
program in our stores which has been
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
very successful helping with trespass
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
orders and keeping the the customers and
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
the employees safe and then it's also
 
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
increases then we have on page 38 what
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
is nabca Ward 150 annual
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
equipment so nabca is the national
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol beverage Association Council we
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
get a grant from them to help with
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
um underage drinking initiatives and the
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
equipment line is they were looking to
 
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
replace their golf cart
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
simulator that they take on the road to
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
high schools to show them impair
 
01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.070 align:start position:0%
high schools to show them impair
driving

01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
yep okay so the next one is federal
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
funds jumping um is that accurate on
 
01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.630 align:start position:0%
funds jumping um is that accurate on
page

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
309 that is correct we did receive or um
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
we have a proposed contract with the FDA
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
for the tobacco compliance
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
funding um page
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
310 it just says information big number
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
can I think it's
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
Source on page
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
310 so is it the increase from 24 to 25
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
we are not projected to spend that whole
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
5.9 million and you'll see in 26 and 27
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
it has decreased to 4.6 and 4.7 okay
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for that so yes it was because
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
we've been told that that the fiscal
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
year 2025 adjusted authorized column is
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
the most accurate data that we know of
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
right and so are you not spending that
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
this year is that the that is correct
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
because if you look at our FY 24 spend
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to be more in line with the
 
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
24 spend than what we were provided for
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
the 25 adjusted authorized all right
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank thank you so so Melissa some of
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
these numbers have not been
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
updated right you told me that all these
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
numbers are now current right they were
 
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
updated as a point of time I will get
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
the point in time that they were updated
 
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
I did not have that part of it but it is
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
the um in in some I don't think I don't
 
01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
know if you guys have fiscal items but
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 25 adjusted authoriz
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
will include hb2 it will include fiscal
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
item dollars what it doesn't account for
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
is what is going to be lapsed or not
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
spent great okay thank you go
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
ahead uh so the next one was page
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
312 um 13 more
 
01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
positions or 13 more employees 50% in
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
finance admin um we reported on our last
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
presentation that we actually moved
 
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
positions from other divisions to
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
support our new system
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
so that's the increase in the positions
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
but there were just moved from other
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
divisions uh page 314 why large increase
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
in Personnel merchandising especially
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
benefits with two
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
fewer so the benefits are based on the
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
current positions so we've had people
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
leave in the marketing and Merchandising
 
01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
Division and other people have come in
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
um I believe the people that left were
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
single and I believe the people that
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
have come in are with families so that
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
has a huge increase in the benefits
 
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.669 align:start position:0%
has a huge increase in the benefits
gotta

01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
gotta
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
okay uh page 315 store salaries up 15%
 
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
when countdown
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
4.5 um that is the pay raise and the
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
benefits the 12% pay raise that we
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
identified in our uh previous
 
01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
presentation that was a significant
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
amount you had we had I believe it was
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
3.5 in um class 10 and another 3 million
 
01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
in class 50 because we also increased
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
the pay rate for our part- timr to bring
 
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
in people at a higher pay to help
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
compete with the private sector gotcha
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
okay uh okay so page 315 why increase in
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
transfer to class 49 as I described
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's the transfer to HHS for the
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund and granted advantage and
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
contracts the increase in contracts is
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
for our new system so we've decreased
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
ined our doit budget um but we had to
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
increase contracts to bring on the
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
support and maintenance for our new
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
software system the d365 because doit
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
can't handle um maintaining the
 
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
system let me ask back to line 49 are
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
you saying granted Advantage is brand
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
new no um I explained I'm sorry you
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
weren't in the room we used to transfer
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
that not as a budget it was an
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
unbudgeted item and it caused a lot of
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
confusion so we decided in this budget
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
cycle to include it as a budget line
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
item item so you'll see we included 24s
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
actual that we transferred and then
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
27 yes so it's a lot more transparent so
 
01:13:14.669 --> 01:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
again so the 5 million is missing from
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
24 but it was transferred or just no
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's increasing it's just increasing so
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
24 is what we actually transferred the
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
17 million and they're projecting the 23
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
million need in 26 and
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
27 oh so it's not a fixed percentage of
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
your so the
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
17616 is the 5% of the prior year gross
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
profit and that's the alcohol abuse and
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
prevention fund it's the 126 AA which is
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the granted Advantage Medicaid
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
expansion that one is based on hhs's
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
need to have the um match for the
 
01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.030 align:start position:0%
need to have the um match for the
non-federal

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
non-federal
 
01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.669 align:start position:0%
non-federal
funding

01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
great and they can also request on a
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis if they see a shortfall
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
in that account they can request more
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
funds which they've done for this year
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
of another 1 to two million okay thank
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
you I'm hoping to cancel all this stuff
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
by the way and just leave this in the
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
general f all right um so page 318 and
 
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
and back to 103 oh 103 and that's the
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
new systems the maintenance and support
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
for our new d365 that replaced our
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
mapper there was no real overhead cost
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
for the prior system and this system now
 
01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.830 align:start position:0%
for the prior system and this system now
being

01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
cloud-based requires um more maintenance
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
and support and doit can't support it so
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
we had to go outside for contracts for
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
that so you basically had a 40y old
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
system for many for obviously that many
 
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
years that had two people part- timers
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
maintaining it and helping us keep it
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
running and price changes Etc the new
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
system is d365
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
Microsoft cloud-based and there's
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
expenses that are incurred along along
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
with that but it's performing better
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's performing very good at this point
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's we're not even a year into it we
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
launched it last April so obviously as
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
you go through the first year of any new
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
system it has its glitches and we've
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
worked through them and we're pretty
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
happy with what we've done and we we
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
think in the future you'll see the
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
benefits of those expenses got more
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
efficiencies yeah okay thank you um page
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
318 um workers comp declining is that
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
correct yes the numbers for workers comp
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
were provided by risk management and
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
were based on um the historical
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
Trend excellent we had a a real Spike um
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
in two years where we were really
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
pushing our employees hard during covid
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
and there were a lot more you know back
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
injuries and stuff like that and now
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
that you know we've streamlined that and
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
we also risk management brought on a new
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
insurance company and they've been
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
fighting a lot more claims than just
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
paying them out like the prior one did
 
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
so that has an impact okay we also only
 
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
have six six stores that are hand unload
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
now we're in the past we had 40 or 50
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
stores that are hand unload everything's
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
pallet unload done mechanically so safer
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
saes absolutely terrific representative
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
Ms for a question is your um is your
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
workers comp program
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
um a standalone for the Liquor
 
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
Commission or is it integrated with
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
other state agencies it's through risk
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
management through the state okay thank
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
you other kind of book related question
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
hb1 line by line kind of questions yes
 
01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.030 align:start position:0%
hb1 line by line kind of questions yes
representative

01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
EV um thank you it's not an enormous
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money but on page 309 uh where
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's the FED funds line that uh the
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
chair asked about and I see it's an FDA
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
tobacco I assume that's a grant
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
um just as a general question what are
 
01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:07.639 align:start position:0%
you hearing about that were your was the
 
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
source of funds cut off do you hope it's
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
going to continue any concerns about
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
that at this point we've heard nothing
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
about nothing and and I will say that
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
when they have cuts at the federal level
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
this we have a one position that is um
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
tied to this actual contract so we call
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
it a grant but it's actually a contract
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
so when there are Cuts with the feds
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
this is not impacted because it's not
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
considered a grant we've always checked
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
in on that when they were doing cuts at
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
the federal level and they said no the
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
way that this is structured it's it's a
 
01:17:44.239 --> 01:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
way that this is structured it's it's a
contract

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
agreement with the federal government
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
with the FDA yeah so is this to make
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
sure that people aren't selling
 
01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
cigarettes to minors is that the whole
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
idea here yes correct okay tobacco
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
compliance check yep gotcha
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay other questions representative
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
lean so good morning so my periodic
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
question is that the declining Revenue
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
issue when you were here a month or so
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
ago we talked about it and I just looked
 
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
at the governor's U projected numbers
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
and for 25 she's got like 92 coming out
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
as far as Revenue back to the State
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
however the revenue estimates for uh
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
26 or somewhere in the neighborhood of
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
115 million are you confident with that
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
increase because you not no fault of
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
your own I guess but you've seen a
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
declining Revenue base and yet she's
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
looking at Revenue numbers that are
 
01:18:44.239 --> 01:18:47.550 align:start position:0%
looking at Revenue numbers that are
substantially

01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
positive we talked to the governor's
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
budget director and he believes that the
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
26 27 numbers are more based on changes
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
for transfers to HHS for the changes in
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
the eligibility for the Medicaid
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
expansion and for some prescription drug
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
um changes and that they think that that
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
will realize a greater transfer to the
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
general fund versus
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
HHS that will and that impact your
 
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
budget in a positive way is that what
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
you're that would reduce the transfer to
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
HHS and would increase the transfer to
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
the general fund okay I do agree with
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
the chair I think at some point we need
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
to look at uh the way the money the 5%
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
because there's no oversight whatsoever
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
on that money it just goes out and there
 
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
a lump sum without any sort of budget
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
being presented yeah my thought is
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
simply to take those two transfers out
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
and make them division 3's problem
 
01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:58.639 align:start position:0%
to to find the money right yeah that's
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
where it really should be I guess yeah
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I think I I I'm just really
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
against automatic spending you know what
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
I mean programmed we agree yeah okay um
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
but yeah so we'll get to that in a
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
minute okay so um so generally then just
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
as far as the liquor business goes
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
You're Expecting relatively flat sort of
 
01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
results is that it yeah I would say that
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
happy because uh the trend in general is
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
down right and drink less drinking more
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
more as cannabis well the trend in
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
general is down and for the reasons that
 
01:20:42.669 --> 01:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
we've gone through cannabis and uh the
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
Baby Boomers aging out of the market and
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
the health piece as well you know and U
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
surgeon drenal comes out and the and uh
 
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
comes out and says that any amount of
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol is in safe and causes cancer
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's a problem so people are uh being
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
very cautious about how much they drink
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
uh they're drinking better but they're
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
not drinking as much and you know the
 
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
three states around us uh we we can't
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
have a a candid conversation about the
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
decline of alcohol without speaking
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
about cannabis Massachusetts in
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
2024 did 1.6 billion in cannabis sales
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
and Maine did about 800 million Vermont
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
did about 300 million 72 million in tax
 
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
to the to the state coffers in
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts from that 1.6 billion U
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's a new industry that's
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
flourishing and alcohol is taking the
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
hit and it's happening Nationwide it's
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
we just happen to be in a very unique
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
situation here in New England now when
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
you said drinking better do you mean
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
going moving up in quality higher priced
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh Liquors I guess yes we don't
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily see people shopping the
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
bottom two shelves they're shopping the
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
the the higher end liquor so they're
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
willing to spend $100 50 to $125 a
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
bottle but they're not they're not
 
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
buying that amount of alcohol on a
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
weekly basis so it's more of a special
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
occasion kind of thing and
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
premiumization is something that grew
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
during uh
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh Co and has leveled up off but it's
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
still there and something that we're
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing that's why our sales we have
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
changed the way we're doing sales you're
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
not seeing as many of the case sales
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
you're seeing the twer and the fourer
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
sales which are driving the business
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
back into the state gotcha okay
 
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.149 align:start position:0%
back into the state gotcha okay
representative

01:22:43.149 --> 01:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
Le thanks Mr chairman so I know grocery
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
stores like Market Basket charge self
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
space um for the products you must do
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
the same thing you mentioned like the
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
premium eye Lev type of product versus
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
something that's lower shelf so that um
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
bottler is paying the liquor store for
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
space on that shelf as well as or not no
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
no so you can't charge there's there's a
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
term and I I I won't be able to think of
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
it as we're speaking but I can get it to
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
you it's uh federally prohibited to
 
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
charge for uh space Oh really for liquor
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
at one point in the in the liquor
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
commission's history they tried to do it
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
with our floor planner a monthly floor
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
planner to charge for the more premium
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
spaces yeah and we were uh we were told
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
by the federal government that you can't
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
do it and and you can't do it oh isn't
 
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
that interesting thanks Mr chairman
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
thank you why don't we get into some of
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
my big question so um where are the
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
worst performing stores
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
maybe well during the thank you during
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
the covid uh pandemic we closed about
 
01:23:59.709 --> 01:23:59.719 align:start position:0%
four 12 or 13 stores maybe as many as 14
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
we were up in the mid 80s we're now down
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the mid 60s but there's still a
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
couple of stores that are marginal
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
they're profitable but they're marginal
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
Walpole would be
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
one Woodsville would be one and then you
 
01:24:19.629 --> 01:24:19.639 align:start position:0%
could you could potentially add oopy and
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
wolfb into that equation what we're
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
doing is looking at the oopy wolf borrow
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
now for maybe a consolidation of those
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
stores into one store and that's really
 
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
what we did during Co and found some
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
additional savings during that period of
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
time but those were the the top two
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
would be uh Walpole and Woodsville so
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
wple would start shopping in Keane or
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah so the brand
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
new Keane store is just a few miles away
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
so okay but that's something that's
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
constantly on your radar for we we look
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
at it pretty much on a quarterly basis
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
to see what stores are performing and
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
which stores we feel are underperforming
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing when when we say
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
underperforming today in retail is are
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
the customers happy with the product
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
selection and because of the increased
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
square footage that we've done in 40
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
plus stores that's what people expect
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
when they go into a store to go into a
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
small store that's you know doesn't have
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
the skus or stocking units that
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
consumers are uh underwhelmed they want
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
to shop in the bigger stores because
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's where the selection is so we're
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
seeing as time goes on the attrition of
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
these smaller stores is just a natural
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
progression right
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair um when you were
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
here for the um introduction a month ago
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that some things that may
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
be on the horizon would be like delivery
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
or or mail liquor how much revenue so
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
obviously I would say that that's a um
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
Market strategy for competition
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
especially how much revenue do we get
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
from alcohol that is mail ordered but
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
originates from out of state so let's
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
say if someone belongs to a wine club
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
and they have wine delivered from
 
01:26:16.109 --> 01:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
California or something how does that
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue get captured we we I assume we
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
get revenue from that how does that get
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
captured well the it's it's uh
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
lovingly called the John Hunt tax okay
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
all right it's an 8% premium tax that's
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
charged on anything that sh it's shipped
 
01:26:35.229 --> 01:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
into the state and we track that through
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
UPS and FedEx through our enforcement
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
Division and that uh 1.2 $1.2 million in
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
2023 1.4 and 23 in 1.2 and
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
24 so I'm sorry could you give me those
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
what was it in 20 am I missing it on a
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
page or something no this is in our
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
annual report oh okay so it's 1.4 in 23
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
and 1.2 in
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
24 okay so it's going to see a slight
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
reduction okay and I think I asked this
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
of you last time but do we do any
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
regulation or tax collection on THC
 
01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
drinks that are coming into the state
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
those are not controlled by the
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
commission at all there's no regulate
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a it's a nationwide issue
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
I mean there's no regulation on THC
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis drinks into many states and
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
many states are recognizing the problem
 
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
that it's creating because people are
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
able to go online and it was part of the
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis bill that failed last year part
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
of it was that was in there for the
 
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission to regulate that as
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
well as we do instate shipments um but
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
without without that bill obviously not
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
only in this state but in many states
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's going unchecked okay so that
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
would have to be require Federal action
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
then well it certainly would require
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
State action of an agency and most
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
likely be the Liquor Commission to come
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
up some with some language in order to
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
oversee that properly okay and I just
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
want to remind you because I think we
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
had a conversation about this offline is
 
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
that some of the THC is derived from
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
hemp so if it's linked to cannabis we
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
would still miss the opportunities or
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
the the potential to tax THC drinks that
 
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
are originating from hemp rather than
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's m it's much like any of
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
the RTD drinks that are out there now
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
that are contain alcohol some of them
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
are malt-based some of them are spirits
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
based so it would be the same type of
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
language that we would need to have with
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
a cannabis based drink or a hemp based
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
drink okay thank
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
you so is this something you would like
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
to sell in the stores or no well I I
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
think some of it some of it is being
 
01:29:03.149 --> 01:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
sold through the beer wholesalers but
 
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
the majority of it is being sold online
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
and shipped into the state and as we've
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
said it's it's an unregulated Revenue
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
source for the state so could we get
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
just that piece out of the last year's
 
01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.590 align:start position:0%
just that piece out of the last year's
Bill

01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
maybe to just regulate that I mean would
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
you need presumably You' need more
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
employees to to to regulate it yeah well
 
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
there there'd be some oversight that
 
01:29:31.629 --> 01:29:31.639 align:start position:0%
would be necessary I mean I I don't
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
think it would be a plethora of
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
employees it' probably be a couple more
 
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
in order to do that okay but that's a
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
potential Revenue Source okay all right
 
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
do you know what for those kind of
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
drinks what uh other states tax rates
 
01:29:51.149 --> 01:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
are not off the top of my head Mr
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
chairman no but I could find out could
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
you find out absolutely thank you um
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
other questions set thank you okay
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ms um back back to the
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
question about um closing stores um do
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
you have any any data that would
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
indicate you know what the what the net
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
impact would be on on on your budget in
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
terms of um you know cost savings
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue loss Etc sure we we could we
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
could certainly do that but historically
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
the the uh the cost of closing a store
 
01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
is is minimal and the the shift that's
 
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
why you know uh the chair mentioned Keen
 
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
if we close Walpole the people consumers
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
just buy in a different location uh the
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
locations are close enough by the new
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
location in Keen is right next to a
 
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
Market Basket that I'm sure everybody in
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
that area shops at so people when
 
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
they're there at Mark they may have to
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
change the times that they buy it might
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
not be as as quote unquote convenient
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
but when they're at Market Basket now
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
they're at the liquor store and they
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
just their shopping patterns are a
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
little different and the overhead for
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
these locations is minimal most of our
 
01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
lower performing stores are ten in it
 
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
will and very very uh nominal square
 
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.510 align:start position:0%
will and very very uh nominal square
footage

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
footage
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
812 where in some of the bigger stores
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
we're paying a little bit more than that
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
12 14 16 but the impact is greater
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
because the sales are greater and
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
there's greater traff traffic flow and
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
and presumably in addition to saving the
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
um the the the rental expense um you
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
would you would save in terms of
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
personnel cost because you wouldn't need
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
to transfer those individuals would you
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
well the the full-time employees would
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
be transferred to to the to a
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
neighboring store okay that those
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
particular stores I'm off the cuff I'm
 
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
saying that Walpole may have two
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
full-timers and Woodsville probably the
 
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
same where're store like Keen uh could
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
have as many as 13 but probably runs
 
01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.470 align:start position:0%
have as many as 13 but probably runs
around

01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
nine and are bigger stores open more
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
hours they are yeah so that's another
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
thing okay um any other okay let's talk
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
about uh licensing and enforcement um
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
how much of our Revenue do we get in
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
licensing fees and also fines so the
 
01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
licensing fees are in 2024 we're 3.7
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
million and the same in 23 so about 3.7
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
have the processing and investigation
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
fees or or I'm sorry administrative
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
142,000 and then we have the direct
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
shipping which we told you was uh 1.2
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
million and then there's the wine tax
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
which is about 300,00
 
01:32:59.709 --> 01:32:59.719 align:start position:0%
,000 an overall enforcement overseas
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
around 6300
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
lies uh inst State out of state Direct
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
ship uh obviously our locations but on
 
01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
premise off premise and we can give you
 
01:33:13.109 --> 01:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
a breakdown of those if you'd like but
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
that's around the number that they
 
01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:17.189 align:start position:0%
that's around the number that they
oversee

01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
oversee
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
okay so when were licensing fees last
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
changed or it is it a constant thing uh
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
they haven't gone up in a long time as
 
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
far as the fees are concerned yeah okay
 
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
so we might we might be do is
 
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
that yeah right yeah I mean well I can
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
certainly tell you and I've always said
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
as a lensee in other states uh I held
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
licenses in New Jersey and Massachusetts
 
01:33:48.669 --> 01:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
as well as New Hampshire New Hampshire's
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
fees have always been what any business
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
person would consider very reasonable
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
compared to the surrounding states okay
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
could you could you put
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
together it doesn't have to be all
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
hundred licenses but you know a couple
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
of sort of um
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative examples of Maine Vermont
 
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire sure and Massachusetts
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
yeah for comparison purpose yeah I I
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
just like to see the statute is the
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
statute where the fees are they are in
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
statute just whatever that
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
as well and don't and and and just for
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
transparency the licenses in Maine and
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
the licenses in Massachusetts and I
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
believe in Vermont are owned by the
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
license of the business and are
 
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
transferable as such New Hampshire is
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
not that way those licenses are renewed
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis and not an asset of
 
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
the business they're certainly an asset
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
of the business as they run and enjoy
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
the prod profs of the alcohol but it's
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
not something that's it's a guarantee
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
we're in Massachusetts when you won't
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
buy a license you own that license and
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's an asset of the business New
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not that way would we save
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
money if we made it not yearly but every
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.310 align:start position:0%
 
years

01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
of course I'm I'm going to say that
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
there' be a lot of people that
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
would understandably push back against
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
any types of fees I don't want to speak
 
01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
for any other organizations but that's
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
always been something that's been a back
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
and forth when the Liquor Commission has
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
had that discussion over the years now
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
so the total cost of enforcement am I
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
right it
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
was is it 10 million a year or something
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
times but it seemed to me there were
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
kind of two sections that were both kind
 
01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
of enforcement but maybe not so there's
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
enforcements overhead themselves which
 
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
is the 77 7878 accounting unit and then
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
they oversee the
 
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
grants that are listed underneath
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
so it's within their activity division
 
01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:34.750 align:start position:0%
so it's within their activity division
okay

01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
so all right so it's mainly what we see
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
on page 310 this 5 million a year is
 
01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.310 align:start position:0%
on page 310 this 5 million a year is
that

01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:00.669 --> 01:37:00.679 align:start position:0%
the actual overhead for the operation of
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement enforcement which is the
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
4.78 in 25 and then the projection for
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
5.3 and 5.5 in 26 and 27 okay so what am
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
I seeing on page 310 is that an overall
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
number no yes that's that's that's for
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
their whole division
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
the enforcement Division and the grants
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
that they oversee that's within their
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
good all right and part of that increase
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
we talked about in on the page 310 was
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
the increase in the federal money that
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
they're receiving couple hundred
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
thousand there
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah right but but they're essentially
 
01:37:53.310 --> 01:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
not really paying for themselves right I
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
me in they bring in about $13 million
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
well they bring in 13 million for the
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
beer tax and then the licensing which is
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
the other 3 million um if you look at I
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have the
 
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
presentation from the last
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.669 --> 01:38:36.679 align:start position:0%
is just the licensing piece of expenses
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
broken out or not
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
really for their the their budget
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
themselves so they bring in 13.3 million
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
in taxes the 4.2 million in
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
fees 142 in fines and then miscellaneous
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
so they're Revenue that they manage is$
 
01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:56.790 align:start position:0%
so they're Revenue that they manage is$
18

01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
million okay and then they oversee the
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
6,300 lienes yeah but probably most of
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
that is the beer tax which takes one or
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
two employees or something right I mean
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's but then they're out in the the all
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the establishments visiting all of
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
the establishments doing the education
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
and the training and the compliance
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
check compliance Che the alcohol
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
compliance checks the tobacco compliance
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
checks and any complaints that come in
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
from lenses or consumers legislature Etc
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
gotta okay all right
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
so um how
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
often is a ly like a like a restaurant
 
01:39:41.199 --> 01:39:42.750 align:start position:0%
often is a ly like a like a restaurant
visited

01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
visited
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
they go ahead I think they tried they
 
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
tried to touch each license lensey uh
 
01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
physically once a year to check on the
 
01:39:55.229 --> 01:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
license itself but then there's
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
compliance checks which would be
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
additional so I would say that they get
 
01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
to every ly two to three times a
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
year okay and helping new licenses
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
yep yes represent so I think you would
 
01:40:13.709 --> 01:40:13.719 align:start position:0%
argue that the
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
compliance portion for enforcement is
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
quite important to ensuring that you get
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
the income I would say the compliance is
 
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
an important piece but I I think one of
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
the most important pieces that the
 
01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
legislature has drawn us to over the
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
years is the education I mean
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're they visited a couple of hundred
 
01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
high schools last year and did
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrations there they do the
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
underage driving um they do
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
all I can we I don't have it in front of
 
01:40:45.149 --> 01:40:45.159 align:start position:0%
me but the amount of Education that they
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
do and stops that they make every year
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
is is uh is quite reasonable for the
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
amount of people that they have oh the
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
have your drive the little car with the
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
wavy glasses all this and testing and
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
and we and they test they they train and
 
01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
test every lensey that has a new license
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
that comes up or anybody that's not in
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
compliance has to go back and have their
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
their employees retrained and then on on
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
premise sales from those establishments
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
million so I mean it's an important
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
piece of what we do and I I don't think
 
01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
that you can have sales without having
 
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
compliance in education they go hand in
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
hand gotcha all
 
01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
right other
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
leishman so I the bottom number as far
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
as the number of employees you have was
 
01:41:48.199 --> 01:41:49.510 align:start position:0%
as the number of employees you have was
like

01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
371 and I noticed a lot of changes
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
um like on page
 
01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.070 align:start position:0%
um like on page
312

01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
312
 
01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:01.639 align:start position:0%
um you're going from number of positions
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
27 up to 40 I'm just kind of curious why
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
the Readjustment there and then under
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
for I'm sorry that's that's for the new
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
system okay yeah that we brought on do
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
some doit employees move them for the
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
oversight of the system and the help
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
desk in the human resource SE and I saw
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
there's quite an adjustment there page
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
47 um that's in
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
total if you look up above HR is seven
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
employees when you look at the 34 to 47
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
administration and that division of
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
administration oversees the new
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
financial management is that what I'm
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry yes financial management
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
Division and that includes do HR Finance
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
our legal department legal okay
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
Maintenance and Facilities but HR is
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
still only seven
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
employees okay so that increase from 34
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
to 46 is the one is for the finance for
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
the new systems we brought in employees
 
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
from store Ops and marketing and created
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
that new okay yeah I was just curious
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
where they came from to get there that's
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
all yeah so well you'll see that um
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
marketing em merchandising went down
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
that was down 14 to 12 and then store
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
Ops we took some um unfunded or vacant
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
positions there and moved them in to
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
help with the new system okay thanks
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
chairman all right other
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
questions all right I guess we can go to
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
L chle today thank you thank you very
 
01:43:55.950 --> 01:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
you'll get us more information about
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
licensing fees and THC drinks maybe yes
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
them down okay and especially comparison
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
to other states and if we could have a
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
list like the stores perhaps they
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned Woodsville Walpole if there
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
are any others that should be on our
 
01:44:17.229 --> 01:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
radar for Clos which I think makes sense
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
I just like to add as far as the fees I
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
guess to be a little sympathetic to The
 
01:44:24.669 --> 01:44:24.679 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission for a change
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little concerned if we um
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
increase fees it's just going to make
 
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
our Revenue collection even worse you
 
01:44:35.229 --> 01:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
know we're struggling to meet plan for
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
fees now or revenue from The Liquor
 
01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
Commission if we increase the fees that
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
may have a negative impact on returning
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
sales or whatever so thank you yeah I
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
mean but it it also depends on you know
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
sort of when fees were set and you know
 
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
cuz one of the fees I'm thinking about
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
we we'll get to later today the Bureau
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
of tax and land appeals I think they
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
said their fee was last set 50 years ago
 
01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.950 align:start position:0%
said their fee was last set 50 years ago
right

01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
so yeah and they didn't want to but you
 
01:45:10.830 --> 01:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
know last time we didn't need cash quite
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
as bad as we do now so Mr chair I would
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
agree that across the uh agencies the
 
01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
fees that have been Char a lot of them
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
haven't been updated since uh what is it
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
Hector was a pups so they were they're
 
01:45:26.669 --> 01:45:26.679 align:start position:0%
worth uh they're worth considering and
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
looking at especially as we know when
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
revenue is down in other ways you got to
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
find ways to creative
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
ways so we'll be back at I think it's
 
01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.150 align:start position:0%
ways so we'll be back at I think it's
115

01:45:40.150 --> 01:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
115
 
01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
115

understand the schedule for the next two
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
or three weeks are you are we're not
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
meeting next two is it Tuesdays the day
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're not meting Tuesdays in general are
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
the days we're not going to be meeting
 
01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
so okay so March 4th or okay that's a
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday yeah so we're gonna meet Monday
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
Wednesday any available Thursday and
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
Friday okay okay so like next week
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
Thursday is available so we're meeting
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to try to get through
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
one pass of of our Pages by the end of
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay and I don't know if Melissa thinks
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
we can do that or not yes So the plan is
 
01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
to do that we are running into a little
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
bit of scheduling issues as next week is
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
school vacation for a lot of people so
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
there are some agencies that have said
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
we we're not available next week at all
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
so we might have to push some of those
 
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
off to the beginning that March 3rd
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
would be the hope to wrap that up if not
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday to at least have all the
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
agencies in and going through their
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
budget leaving us a couple of weeks to
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
get through and start making
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
decisions and at that point hopefully we
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
have HB
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
to in front of us and I'm just TR so
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
March 11th I think is town meeting day
 
01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
don't we usually have that off we
 
01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
normally don't schedule okay so that's
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
one two I'm just trying to figure out
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative

preemptively answer some of the things
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
either you've asked previously or um
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
that you had given us a heads up that

you were looking for um or other things
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
we thought were relevant but I'm happy

to just take questions if uh You' like
 
03:18:10.830 --> 03:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
to go that route why don't we go through
 
03:18:12.910 --> 03:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
the pages and then if you have things on
 
03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
your list that we haven't gotten to then
 
03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
you can add them absolutely so starting
 
03:18:18.510 --> 03:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
on page
 
03:18:21.870 --> 03:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
159 take a look at class line 30 next
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
second to the last yes so there's a lot
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
of equipment last bium and like nothing
 
03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
this bium is that is that right for you
 
03:18:34.070 --> 03:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
guys that is correct uh last byn we had
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
to replace our entire fleet U so that
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
was the cost last byn this year we do
 
03:18:42.070 --> 03:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
not have to replace any of the vehicles
 
03:18:45.550 --> 03:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't know you had Vehicles yes
 
03:18:48.550 --> 03:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
for inspectors oh okay I see all right
 
03:18:51.070 --> 03:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
good so that's that
 
03:18:53.950 --> 03:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
one anybody else want to ask about this
 
03:18:56.349 --> 03:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
page all right represent run thank you
 
03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair how many vehicles do you have
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
are they all passenger
 
03:19:04.070 --> 03:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles yes all passenger vehicles uh
 
03:19:07.030 --> 03:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
let me count my inspectors 15 I'm
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
looking at Heather I have 15 inspectors
 
03:19:10.510 --> 03:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
that all have their own Vehicles so we
 
03:19:12.550 --> 03:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
have 15
 
03:19:16.750 --> 03:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
Vehicles all right and so um on the
 
03:19:19.429 --> 03:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
basically in the same area but on this
 
03:19:21.229 --> 03:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
it's really on the next page you have
 
03:19:24.670 --> 03:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
positions so are you
 
03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
adding uh more responsibility is that
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
having oh from the 16 to the 20 right it
 
03:19:38.910 --> 03:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
went from 16 to 20 yes so I I believe
 
03:19:42.790 --> 03:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
that would account for we had um several
 
03:19:44.590 --> 03:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
8 temporary positions that we had
 
03:19:47.590 --> 03:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
requested become permanent positions and
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
that would three of the four I'm
 
03:19:53.550 --> 03:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
confident are related to the hearings um
 
03:19:55.189 --> 03:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau within the the office of
 
03:19:56.389 --> 03:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
administration so that's two
 
03:19:58.110 --> 03:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
administrative law judges and then a
 
03:19:58.120 --> 03:19:59.070 align:start position:0%
administrative law judges and then a
hearings

03:19:59.070 --> 03:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
03:20:01.750 --> 03:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
clerk um and the fourth one I believe is
 
03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
a project manager um within the
 
03:20:07.070 --> 03:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
Operations Division to um try to work on
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
making sure that everything as the
 
03:20:12.469 --> 03:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
office is um working on uh compliance
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
and we have multiple IT projects going
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
for a new licensing system hoping for a
 
03:20:18.750 --> 03:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
new enforcement system as well um trying
 
03:20:20.309 --> 03:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
to manage keep everything together so
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
those would be those four positions so
 
03:20:24.550 --> 03:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
they're existing temporary with people
 
03:20:26.750 --> 03:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
in them uh integral part of day-to-day
 
03:20:28.189 --> 03:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
functioning that we're requesting to
 
03:20:28.199 --> 03:20:29.389 align:start position:0%
functioning that we're requesting to
become

03:20:29.389 --> 03:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
become
 
03:20:31.950 --> 03:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
permanent okay very good yes
 
03:20:35.389 --> 03:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative W in uh
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 the governor transfers the uh
 
03:20:41.550 --> 03:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
plumbing and electrical to safety so you
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
lose five mechanical and four electrical
 
03:20:47.550 --> 03:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
I don't see that that's reflected so the
 
03:20:49.710 --> 03:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
the 20 positions here is just the
 
03:20:51.229 --> 03:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
division of administration so that's
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
executive director and operations those
 
03:20:57.429 --> 03:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
nine positions are in the division of
 
03:21:00.590 --> 03:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement presently yeah yeah we'll
 
03:21:02.790 --> 03:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
get to that on page
 
03:21:11.110 --> 03:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
page so what's the difference between
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
the administration division and the
 
03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
licensing and board Administration
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
division so because the office is an
 
03:21:25.870 --> 03:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
office and not a department there is
 
03:21:28.150 --> 03:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's in it basically the office
 
03:21:31.150 --> 03:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
consists of the administration which
 
03:21:32.309 --> 03:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
would be the office of the executive
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
director in operations so we and then I
 
03:21:37.389 --> 03:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
have a Licensing in board Administration
 
03:21:39.070 --> 03:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
so those are the folks who are sitting
 
03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
in board meetings with boards and then
 
03:21:44.030 --> 03:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
the licensing service representative so
 
03:21:45.630 --> 03:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
the ones on phones and emails and
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
issuing credentials
 
03:21:49.710 --> 03:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
within the Licensing Division and then
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
the enforcement so um okay
 
03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
yep and each one
 
03:22:00.910 --> 03:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
has ah okay so why why does enforcement
 
03:22:03.189 --> 03:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
have so many
 
03:22:05.590 --> 03:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
unclassified the pharmacy inspectors
 
03:22:07.349 --> 03:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
there are three Pharmacy inspectors that
 
03:22:09.870 --> 03:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
are unclassified Personnel they're
 
03:22:11.469 --> 03:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
appointed by governor and executive
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
counsel and that as a result the um it's
 
03:22:19.070 --> 03:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
the budgeting for the position the
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
salaries does not uh the range is far
 
03:22:24.830 --> 03:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
beyond the um classified system so they
 
03:22:26.229 --> 03:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
have to be in that unclassified space so
 
03:22:28.950 --> 03:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's the one division director and then
 
03:22:31.910 --> 03:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
the three Pharmacy inspectors gotta so
 
03:22:33.910 --> 03:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
the only other unclassified positions
 
03:22:35.790 --> 03:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
are myself and then the director of
 
03:22:38.389 --> 03:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
Licensing and administration so six
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
total okay and how many um those
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy inspectors how many pharmacies
 
03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
do they inspect
 
03:22:49.870 --> 03:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
I believe this is a a round number but I
 
03:22:51.550 --> 03:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
believe it's
 
03:22:54.189 --> 03:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
300 okay so it's like a 100 a piece or
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.510 --> 03:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes they also have a statutory
 
03:23:04.229 --> 03:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility so any Heather will uh
 
03:23:05.469 --> 03:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
correct me with the correct technical
 
03:23:08.189 --> 03:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
term so uh facilities that have
 
03:23:10.030 --> 03:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances so that could even
 
03:23:12.830 --> 03:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
be veterinary offices um any of those
 
03:23:14.229 --> 03:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
there there's oversight and the
 
03:23:17.590 --> 03:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
inspection um requirement there so it's
 
03:23:19.950 --> 03:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
there are the standing pharmacies
 
03:23:22.189 --> 03:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hospital pharmacies and then this other
 
03:23:27.189 --> 03:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
very quite broad um reach don't you
 
03:23:31.950 --> 03:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative Griffin thank you um
 
03:23:37.389 --> 03:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
on page 160 line 531 and Pad programs
 
03:23:39.389 --> 03:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
did you talked about them a little bit I
 
03:23:42.670 --> 03:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
see the numbers unchanging over four
 
03:23:45.469 --> 03:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
years yes that is uh what we call the
 
03:23:47.429 --> 03:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
PHP the Prof professional health
 
03:23:49.550 --> 03:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
professionals health program that is a
 
03:23:51.790 --> 03:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
program it's a it's actually a dedicated
 
03:23:53.950 --> 03:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
fund um that we have discussed over the
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
past several months with the dedicated
 
03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
fund committee and others that is um a
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
requirement by Statute that uh lenses
 
03:24:04.830 --> 03:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
Who Um can self-report and be referred
 
03:24:06.550 --> 03:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
to this program for assistance with um
 
03:24:06.560 --> 03:24:09.630 align:start position:0%
to this program for assistance with um
substance

03:24:09.630 --> 03:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
misuse right representative Ms then
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative R thank you Mr chair
 
03:24:15.750 --> 03:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming back to talk to us
 
03:24:15.760 --> 03:24:17.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming back to talk to us
um

03:24:17.030 --> 03:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:21.229 --> 03:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
on page 160 um Consultants uh there was
 
03:24:24.429 --> 03:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
a significant jump from 24 to 25 and
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
that is staying at the same level what
 
03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
what is
 
03:24:30.110 --> 03:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
that um those would be uh consultants
 
03:24:32.070 --> 03:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
for the division of enforcement so as
 
03:24:33.870 --> 03:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
you're aware we have uh 57 different
 
03:24:36.349 --> 03:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
boards um that we have investigators on
 
03:24:38.710 --> 03:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
staff um and prosecutors so those
 
03:24:39.750 --> 03:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
Consultants would be if there's
 
03:24:41.469 --> 03:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
something specifically technical that we
 
03:24:43.229 --> 03:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
need assistance within an
 
03:24:45.469 --> 03:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
investigation um some of the fact
 
03:24:47.389 --> 03:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
finding is fairly St forward if we have
 
03:24:50.429 --> 03:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
a you a report of a DUI um some of these
 
03:24:51.670 --> 03:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
other things are very clear on their
 
03:24:53.670 --> 03:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
face if it's technical or involves scop
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
of practice we are often working with
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
Consultants to ensure that we have
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
adequate facts and investigation to
 
03:25:03.469 --> 03:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:06.910 --> 03:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
boards okay represent rung thank you Mr
 
03:25:10.030 --> 03:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
chair also on that same page um the
 
03:25:11.469 --> 03:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
indirect costs
 
03:25:15.429 --> 03:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
040 um there was kind of a jump just for
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh 202 5 and then uh the same thing is
 
03:25:23.469 --> 03:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:26.510 --> 03:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
um oh transfer to other state agencies
 
03:25:28.469 --> 03:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
could you go into more detail about that
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
I'm GNA have Heather Kelly address that
 
03:25:32.590 --> 03:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you originally in the
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
indirect cost in 2025 we have an
 
03:25:37.830 --> 03:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
agreement with Department of Justice to
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
pay for a
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated um staff position 90% of a
 
03:25:47.070 --> 03:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
paralal position and a part-time
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
position so that's why there's a jump um
 
03:25:53.790 --> 03:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
we are then moving that cost back into
 
03:25:56.790 --> 03:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
the sagap allocation instead of the
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
separate mou with
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
doj okay so the and I'm I'm a rookie
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
here so I can ask any question I want um
 
03:26:09.030 --> 03:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
so the IND so what you're saying is the
 
03:26:10.910 --> 03:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
the jump in the indirect costs are
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
because of sharing a position with doj
 
03:26:17.110 --> 03:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay um and then why does that go back
 
03:26:19.710 --> 03:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
down um uh we have transferred the cost
 
03:26:22.229 --> 03:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
into the S cap analysis oh okay all
 
03:26:24.510 --> 03:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
right and then the transfer to other
 
03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:26.150 align:start position:0%
right and then the transfer to other
agencies

03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
03:26:29.950 --> 03:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:32.910 --> 03:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
049 that is also part of the reason
 
03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
correct and we had um various uh Comm uh
 
03:26:38.349 --> 03:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
agreements with division of personnel
 
03:26:40.710 --> 03:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
for HR Services I was able to negotiate
 
03:26:43.189 --> 03:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
that down to a lower rate uh there were
 
03:26:45.269 --> 03:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
some other M that we are no longer using
 
03:26:47.950 --> 03:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
as well okay thank you you're
 
03:26:52.309 --> 03:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
welcome how many lenses are there
 
03:26:54.790 --> 03:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
total the total I'll give you a round
 
03:26:56.950 --> 03:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
number so the in our last annual report
 
03:27:00.750 --> 03:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
the total was 212,000 just over 212,000
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
down it's going down um but only in
 
03:27:12.030 --> 03:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
recent history so the number was
 
03:27:15.189 --> 03:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
extremely high during pandemic years
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
when um there was a lot of out of
 
03:27:19.830 --> 03:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
licensure portability kind of exploded
 
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
and people were getting licenses
 
03:27:23.710 --> 03:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses lots of changes there
 
03:27:26.429 --> 03:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
I it's settling down um I don't have the
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
annual part in front of me but there the
 
03:27:31.309 --> 03:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
trend from four years ago is down but
 
03:27:32.910 --> 03:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
03:27:36.150 --> 03:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah if that makes sense yes over the
 
03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
long history I would not say it's
 
03:27:39.910 --> 03:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
trending downward okay especially as we
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
had more license
 
03:27:44.030 --> 03:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
types so that the fact that your budget
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
is relatively flat that's a good thing
 
03:27:50.150 --> 03:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.910 --> 03:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
thinking I mean your budget total looks
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
like 14 million
 
03:28:00.150 --> 03:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
this 14 and a half yes yeah Fair yes
 
03:28:03.349 --> 03:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
fairly close yep okay so how much is
 
03:28:04.830 --> 03:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
that per
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
license that's like
 
03:28:10.750 --> 03:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh 70 I don't don't have a calculator
 
03:28:12.910 --> 03:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
but I'd be I'd happy to defer to
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's Mental Math yeah something
 
03:28:20.229 --> 03:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:23.070 --> 03:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
I guess most lenses are
 
03:28:25.590 --> 03:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
paying 15 for two years or something is
 
03:28:28.110 --> 03:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
that what they do I would say that is
 
03:28:31.750 --> 03:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
that would be high for many boards yes
 
03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
um an RN in the state of New Hampshire I
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:42.550 --> 03:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
years 100 100 for two years okay so
 
03:28:44.349 --> 03:28:44.359 align:start position:0%
there must be some that are way up there
 
03:28:47.950 --> 03:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so and APRN is 100 and RN is 80
 
03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh this is off the top of my
 
03:28:54.830 --> 03:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
head I think Pharmacy I think is
 
03:28:58.830 --> 03:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
300 anyway there it varies uh and until
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
this past year um boards had the the fee
 
03:29:03.269 --> 03:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
setting Authority for each of their
 
03:29:05.110 --> 03:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
boards for their licenses that
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility Now lies with the office
 
03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
to do fee analysis we talked a little
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
bit the last time that um Heather and I
 
03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
were before this committee about um how
 
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing that assessment to
 
03:29:16.189 --> 03:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
determine where the levels need to be
 
03:29:16.199 --> 03:29:17.550 align:start position:0%
determine where the levels need to be
that

03:29:17.550 --> 03:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:20.429 --> 03:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
um yes to ensure that the costs are
 
03:29:23.389 --> 03:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
adequately covered but not exorbitantly
 
03:29:25.070 --> 03:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
so we we have a statutory requirement to
 
03:29:28.750 --> 03:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
stay within 125% of our operation um our
 
03:29:30.070 --> 03:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
estimated Revenue that is in the
 
03:29:32.510 --> 03:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
presentation I'll touch on that here if
 
03:29:36.750 --> 03:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
just as part of conversation um we we
 
03:29:39.189 --> 03:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
are going to to propose a 10% increase
 
03:29:42.110 --> 03:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
in licensing fees across all types and
 
03:29:44.070 --> 03:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
then that expected revenue for the banum
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
would be 27 million
 
03:29:51.870 --> 03:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
166,167 our expected expenses is 28
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
m752 so we're we're still about a
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
million dollar short so we are
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
definitely not at 125% even with a 10%
 
03:30:02.550 --> 03:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
increase and even with a a cut actually
 
03:30:04.870 --> 03:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
a lower
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
budget Mr chair yes are those are those
 
03:30:12.150 --> 03:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
um increases assumed in this budget are
 
03:30:13.750 --> 03:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
they reflected in this
 
03:30:16.469 --> 03:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
budget the fee
 
03:30:18.269 --> 03:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
the licensing the licensing fees would
 
03:30:20.030 --> 03:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
be a fee proposal that would go in rule
 
03:30:21.429 --> 03:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
before the joint legislative committee
 
03:30:23.950 --> 03:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
on administrative rules so we that
 
03:30:25.550 --> 03:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
revenue is controlled by that separate
 
03:30:27.469 --> 03:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
committee so this is just the expenses
 
03:30:29.229 --> 03:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
that you that you guys are hearing about
 
03:30:32.189 --> 03:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
so again the proposed budget is is 28
 
03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
and and change which is short of even
 
03:30:37.309 --> 03:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
the 10% fee increase that we're um
 
03:30:39.469 --> 03:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
planning to propose it's in in the
 
03:30:42.389 --> 03:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
middle of an um impact analysis
 
03:30:46.030 --> 03:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
presently fiscal impact analysis
 
03:30:47.830 --> 03:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
are you going to have to come back next
 
03:30:49.710 --> 03:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
a year from now for another increase
 
03:30:52.309 --> 03:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
then to because you're still short I
 
03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't hope so um the the plan I'm sorry
 
03:30:59.870 --> 03:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
in my the handout that we
 
03:31:02.189 --> 03:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
proposed on page
 
03:31:05.550 --> 03:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
four the anticipation So currently oplc
 
03:31:07.630 --> 03:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
is is at a net loss of just over a
 
03:31:10.189 --> 03:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars for this fiscal year so
 
03:31:11.469 --> 03:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
the the hiring frees the governor
 
03:31:13.110 --> 03:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
instituted an executive order we had
 
03:31:14.990 --> 03:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
kind of already lightly implemented even
 
03:31:16.150 --> 03:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
over the last several months months
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
realizing that revenues were not keeping
 
03:31:21.510 --> 03:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
up with expenses and um so hiring has
 
03:31:23.870 --> 03:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
been slowed or paused even prior to that
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
executive order going out the office the
 
03:31:29.189 --> 03:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund had a roll over at the
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
end of the last banum of um you can see
 
03:31:35.269 --> 03:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
that number 4.5 almost 4.6 so the
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
remaining balance um has come down so
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
the plan would be to continue to use
 
03:31:41.269 --> 03:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
that balance so that fees don't increase
 
03:31:43.229 --> 03:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
further while we maintain a hiring
 
03:31:44.830 --> 03:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
freeze until we get to a place that
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
we're that were
 
03:31:54.429 --> 03:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:57.030 --> 03:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
unfilled I
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
have I believe it is five I have a
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
number of positions that are frozen the
 
03:32:04.429 --> 03:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
office also has um temporary positions
 
03:32:06.110 --> 03:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
that are not allocated in this budget
 
03:32:07.389 --> 03:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
the hope would be that when a new
 
03:32:09.389 --> 03:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
licensing portal is is built and
 
03:32:11.150 --> 03:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
functional it R reduce the need for the
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
Manpower in our licensing and
 
03:32:14.790 --> 03:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
administration we're not there yet so
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
those temporary positions are are still
 
03:32:21.189 --> 03:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh contemplated to be to be funded um to
 
03:32:23.070 --> 03:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
have funds available to continue to
 
03:32:25.030 --> 03:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
compensate them so the positions that
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
are currently Frozen is um are listed on
 
03:32:27.840 --> 03:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
are currently Frozen is um are listed on
page

03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
six I believe that five of those are in
 
03:32:36.189 --> 03:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
the 89 or excuse me five of those are
 
03:32:39.189 --> 03:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
full-time positions the none of the 89
 
03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
that are funded in the budget are
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
currently filled there are no there are
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
no vacancies in the budget as presented
 
03:32:47.870 --> 03:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
okay and you said you're working on a
 
03:32:50.309 --> 03:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
new portal is there funds for that in
 
03:32:53.469 --> 03:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
here somewhere no that uh the funds for
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
that I was working with two separate
 
03:32:56.389 --> 03:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
contractors but that is a doit
 
03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
maintained contract and it's arpa funds
 
03:33:03.070 --> 03:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
so um it they will use them until they
 
03:33:06.550 --> 03:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
run up it's essentially paid for yes I'm
 
03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
not confident we're going to be able to
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
complete it with those funds but we will
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
not be requesting additional funds for
 
03:33:13.950 --> 03:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
that gotcha other questions
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
representative wer
 
03:33:20.429 --> 03:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on page
 
03:33:24.750 --> 03:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
163 uh source of funds education trust
 
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
fund a million and a half what is that
 
03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:33.110 align:start position:0%
fund a million and a half what is that
money

03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:35.910 --> 03:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
for I don't think that is our office
 
03:33:37.710 --> 03:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
anymore I think we end in the middle of
 
03:33:40.670 --> 03:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
63 where the total number of positions
 
03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
with 89 I think that's the end of our
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
office oh wrong okay thank you you have
 
03:33:50.110 --> 03:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
me panicked representative I could use a
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
million and a half dollars though I will
 
03:33:54.910 --> 03:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
say yeah yeah that's the end of section
 
03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
one right section one General government
 
03:34:00.030 --> 03:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
right so that's the grand total for all
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:07.790 --> 03:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
you but you can kind of see just as long
 
03:34:10.349 --> 03:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
as we're on that page right the big
 
03:34:13.309 --> 03:34:13.319 align:start position:0%
increase in section
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
one by 519
 
03:34:20.229 --> 03:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
for million for this year and 645 for
 
03:34:22.590 --> 03:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
the next one yeah right I mean that's a
 
03:34:22.600 --> 03:34:23.469 align:start position:0%
the next one yeah right I mean that's a
huge

03:34:23.469 --> 03:34:23.479 align:start position:0%
huge
 
03:34:25.830 --> 03:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
increase and section one is all our
 
03:34:30.429 --> 03:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
section right so it's our stuff going
 
03:34:34.349 --> 03:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
on so obviously we haven't found the the
 
03:34:36.229 --> 03:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
big numbers yet yes as you noticed ours
 
03:34:39.510 --> 03:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
are down we both years yeah right yours
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
is down yeah so you're not the problem
 
03:34:44.830 --> 03:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for saying that we don't think
 
03:34:46.469 --> 03:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
so either
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
yes we're we're looking for all right
 
03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
yes represent mon hey can I ask one one
 
03:34:53.070 --> 03:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
more question um I should have asked
 
03:34:55.309 --> 03:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
this when you came in the first time but
 
03:34:59.110 --> 03:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
um how do the number of lenses that that
 
03:35:02.269 --> 03:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
you're responsible for compare to other
 
03:35:05.229 --> 03:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
states you know may like on a per capita
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
basis or something I mean I guess what
 
03:35:10.710 --> 03:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
I'm getting at is do we do we license
 
03:35:14.510 --> 03:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
more than other states or less I don't
 
03:35:17.269 --> 03:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that I have um we
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
have a member of our staff who's done
 
03:35:20.189 --> 03:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
some market analysis for a few other
 
03:35:21.389 --> 03:35:21.399 align:start position:0%
things that we could we could definitely
 
03:35:23.189 --> 03:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
have her look into that and and see what
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
it looks like my back of the napkin math
 
03:35:27.790 --> 03:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
um of percentage of the population is a
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
little bit off because uh the 1 uh 3
 
03:35:33.389 --> 03:35:33.399 align:start position:0%
million is going up right the population
 
03:35:36.030 --> 03:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
is increasing so I do think it's 15 to
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
17% of the population though currently
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
in um would would out hold a license a
 
03:35:44.110 --> 03:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
credential from this office okay and and
 
03:35:47.389 --> 03:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
and if I may another yes go and you know
 
03:35:49.389 --> 03:35:49.399 align:start position:0%
last year there was uh or last session
 
03:35:52.229 --> 03:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of U shall we say
 
03:35:55.990 --> 03:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
discussion about um changing
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
classifications and restructuring and
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
Licensing and all that stuff
 
03:36:04.990 --> 03:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
um does that have a significant impact
 
03:36:07.469 --> 03:36:07.479 align:start position:0%
on your expenditures if if changes like
 
03:36:10.429 --> 03:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
that get made yeah I I guess what I'll
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
say kind of conceptually is the the way
 
03:36:14.870 --> 03:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
that our office incurs costs is either
 
03:36:16.349 --> 03:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
members of the state actually or even
 
03:36:19.510 --> 03:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
out of state get a credential required
 
03:36:22.030 --> 03:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
by law or they break the law that
 
03:36:25.110 --> 03:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
governs their profession so uh I'm not
 
03:36:26.349 --> 03:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
out there telling people hey don't
 
03:36:27.630 --> 03:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
become a plumber because it costs me
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
money to give you a license um that you
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
know so I think
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
the and I I think the F the reason that
 
03:36:38.670 --> 03:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
you would have the the office is fee
 
03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
funded is to say that we want it to be
 
03:36:43.830 --> 03:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
almost a one for one the amount of of
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
money that it takes to administer the
 
03:36:47.870 --> 03:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
licensing would come for those fees and
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
and no more and really no less so that
 
03:36:52.510 --> 03:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
that is the goal is to get it to that
 
03:36:54.510 --> 03:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
place if we have fewer licenses will
 
03:36:55.950 --> 03:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
have less Revenue but will'll also have
 
03:36:58.229 --> 03:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
less work you the breaking the law part
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
is it's kind of implied right you have
 
03:37:02.429 --> 03:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
to obey by your the laws and rules of
 
03:37:04.349 --> 03:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
your profession so those enforcement
 
03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
costs are incurred when people are not
 
03:37:07.550 --> 03:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
doing what they're supposed to be doing
 
03:37:09.150 --> 03:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
again if there's fewer license types
 
03:37:10.550 --> 03:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
then you're not dealing with unlicensed
 
03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
practice for those professions so the
 
03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
the cost incurred by giving people
 
03:37:18.110 --> 03:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
license or doing that enforcement the
 
03:37:19.870 --> 03:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
the theory is that it's offset with the
 
03:37:23.110 --> 03:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
fee uh that has not been in balance for
 
03:37:25.469 --> 03:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons and um there's
 
03:37:27.150 --> 03:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
some analysis there's obviously a lot of
 
03:37:28.910 --> 03:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
tension in budgeting and we haven't
 
03:37:31.189 --> 03:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
gotten 100% to where I'd like to be
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
where where that is actually even that
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
the the scale is balanced but to say
 
03:37:37.309 --> 03:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
that we're we're able to maintain
 
03:37:39.710 --> 03:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
operations um I'd love to get it to a
 
03:37:42.189 --> 03:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
place where it is it's more specific to
 
03:37:44.429 --> 03:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
the individual boards um but currently
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
we're kind of looking at a big picture
 
03:37:49.150 --> 03:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
for the whole office a full reset is
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
um a a future dream of mine yeah
 
03:37:57.550 --> 03:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
representative evil so just um on page
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
five of your presentation um where
 
03:38:02.630 --> 03:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the changes to hb2
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
could you just kind of go through those
 
03:38:09.150 --> 03:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
AB for us and and and so for people that
 
03:38:13.710 --> 03:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:16.510 --> 03:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
71 thank you very much um happy to
 
03:38:19.630 --> 03:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
report is many fewer Pages than the last
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
bium that deal with
 
03:38:25.469 --> 03:38:25.479 align:start position:0%
oplc so um there really two big pieces
 
03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
here um and both related to inspections
 
03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
so when we were looking at um you know
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
every agency has had to take a hard look
 
03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
at their budget and just say what what
 
03:38:36.870 --> 03:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
do we need um I I can't even say it's
 
03:38:38.550 --> 03:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
lwh hanging fruit but assessing where
 
03:38:40.269 --> 03:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
can efficiencies be made what does that
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
look like and in assessing those
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
essential functions one of the things
 
03:38:46.229 --> 03:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
that we looked at is okay so we've got
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
to get licenses out the door and we have
 
03:38:49.710 --> 03:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's timely review
 
03:38:50.830 --> 03:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
of complaints we're working on that
 
03:38:52.590 --> 03:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
process I've spoken publicly and in many
 
03:38:54.189 --> 03:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
other committees about needing to
 
03:38:55.790 --> 03:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
continue to improve that process to be
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
more responsive for constituents and
 
03:39:00.349 --> 03:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
also for lenses who have have complaints
 
03:39:01.790 --> 03:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
that can be out there for any number of
 
03:39:04.590 --> 03:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
years and when we looked at inspections
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
and that kind of compliance piece of it
 
03:39:08.150 --> 03:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
we were trying to assess what does this
 
03:39:09.710 --> 03:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
look like what's the public health and
 
03:39:12.510 --> 03:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
safety protection um there and what is a
 
03:39:14.790 --> 03:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
licensing function when we were looking
 
03:39:16.870 --> 03:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
at the mechanic so that's um plumbers
 
03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
and gas Fitters the mechan it can be a
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing so plumbers and gas
 
03:39:23.349 --> 03:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
Fitters um and then um heating service
 
03:39:25.870 --> 03:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
technicians are within that profession
 
03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
and then the electrical inspectors those
 
03:39:30.429 --> 03:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
positions moved from the Department of
 
03:39:31.510 --> 03:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
Safety in
 
03:39:34.710 --> 03:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
20121 per legislation over to oplc with
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
the licensing board now what what has
 
03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
happened is I think as I was just having
 
03:39:41.550 --> 03:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
conversation on another uh Bill and
 
03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
we're also dealing with a similar
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
situation with assessors is that there's
 
03:39:47.110 --> 03:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
there's some policy making and some
 
03:39:48.910 --> 03:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
standard setting and then there's
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
licensing and sometimes those um pieces
 
03:39:54.590 --> 03:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
are intertwined in a given um department
 
03:39:56.110 --> 03:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
and then when the licensing function is
 
03:39:57.870 --> 03:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
sought to move over to oplc to kind of
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
just standardize that and and fit it in
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
and find some efficiencies some of those
 
03:40:03.990 --> 03:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
policy Pieces come with it that really
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
are better suited to be in other spaces
 
03:40:08.429 --> 03:40:08.439 align:start position:0%
um so when we were looking at the
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
mechanical and electrical inspectors the
 
03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
the duty of the fire Marshall's office
 
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of regulations involving
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
um safety um fire concerns code
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement of those types of things the
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's really the what these inspectors
 
03:40:24.670 --> 03:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
are doing they're assisting
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities um they're providing a a
 
03:40:29.870 --> 03:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
critical Public Safety function um but
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
the positions had traveled with the
 
03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
board to oplc so the assessment was made
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
to say this is really a a this is a
 
03:40:38.910 --> 03:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
safety function uh the fire Marshall's
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
office is um is utilizing them um as
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
needed because they have this expertise
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
they are lienes in the field and so
 
03:40:50.910 --> 03:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
that's the governor's office um proposed
 
03:40:52.710 --> 03:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
restoring those based on a policy
 
03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
consideration not just on I think
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
initially the conversation was the fees
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
from this board licensing fees are
 
03:41:00.950 --> 03:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
paying these inspectors let's put the
 
03:41:03.550 --> 03:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
inspectors where the fees are uh for a
 
03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
number of reasons the collective
 
03:41:08.269 --> 03:41:08.279 align:start position:0%
bargaining salary increases all of those
 
03:41:10.229 --> 03:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
things expenses have gone up the
 
03:41:11.910 --> 03:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
licensing fees are not coming close to
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
covering those costs anymore and the
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
assessment was this really is a public
 
03:41:17.910 --> 03:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
safety function so rather than just
 
03:41:19.710 --> 03:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
making a financial decision I think it
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
was to make a policy decision to have
 
03:41:23.070 --> 03:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
them there really where it fits in the
 
03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
scope of that um office the fire
 
03:41:27.070 --> 03:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office and the need
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
there um happy to pause just if there's
 
03:41:31.309 --> 03:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
any questions but that was the
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:37.199 --> 03:41:40.309 align:start position:0%
 
piece

03:41:40.309 --> 03:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:43.389 --> 03:41:43.399 align:start position:0%
yes no so I I believe the proposal would
 
03:41:44.870 --> 03:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
be safety is would be funding that with
 
03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:46.750 align:start position:0%
be safety is would be funding that with
General

03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
General
 
03:41:46.760 --> 03:41:54.790 align:start position:0%
General
funds

03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:57.630 --> 03:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
yep yes and then the second one is uh
 
03:42:01.269 --> 03:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
related to cosmetology inspections so
 
03:42:05.710 --> 03:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
the when we were looking at um things
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
that require Manpower are do we need to
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I I asked and we
 
03:42:13.110 --> 03:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
were talking through is do do we need to
 
03:42:16.269 --> 03:42:16.279 align:start position:0%
be in every Cosmetology shop every year
 
03:42:18.189 --> 03:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
um doing these inspections a lot of the
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
concerns are with sanitation procedures
 
03:42:23.309 --> 03:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
and that type of um just type of concern
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
the general health and safety um The
 
03:42:30.670 --> 03:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
Proposal in hb2 is to go um OSHA already
 
03:42:32.349 --> 03:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
offers a course but it could be an
 
03:42:34.590 --> 03:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
additional or similar course of a
 
03:42:36.790 --> 03:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
lifetime certification in the sanitation
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
procedure specific to barbering and
 
03:42:41.550 --> 03:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and so to say uh similar to
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
a f a food service establishment that
 
03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
has to have you know Serve Safe CER IED
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
we we don't have state government with
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
inspectors that are going to restaurants
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
every year annually just to ensure that
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're compliant so the this
 
03:43:00.149 --> 03:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
provides an option to either a a shop
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
could be inspected again annually um so
 
03:43:05.790 --> 03:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
it would be upon initial
 
03:43:08.110 --> 03:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
application a routine inspection in the
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
second year and then a renewal and then
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
a routine in that the subsequent year or
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
they could um
 
03:43:17.229 --> 03:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they've they've
 
03:43:19.349 --> 03:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
completed this course uh for a lifetime
 
03:43:20.990 --> 03:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
certification and then that would exempt
 
03:43:23.429 --> 03:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
them from the need for those inspections
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
um it does it reduces costs so a a
 
03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
routine any inspection is is a $100 so
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
instead of $100 a year this one course
 
03:43:35.590 --> 03:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
would be a lifetime piece um if shops
 
03:43:38.149 --> 03:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
choose the the lifetime course in
 
03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
sanitation we're still providing that
 
03:43:43.149 --> 03:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
they um the potential is there that we
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
would need fewer staff on if we we're
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
not getting to all I think there are
 
03:43:49.189 --> 03:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
about 3,000 shops and we have three
 
03:43:51.149 --> 03:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
members of the staff so it would reduce
 
03:43:53.590 --> 03:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
the workload and the hope would be then
 
03:43:55.189 --> 03:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to do initial
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
inspections for on for new shops that
 
03:43:58.630 --> 03:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
are opening to make sure that they
 
03:44:00.750 --> 03:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
they're in compliance with all the rules
 
03:44:02.510 --> 03:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
and then in response to complaints we
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
would still have an um an inspector on
 
03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
staff if there's a concern if a compl a
 
03:44:09.750 --> 03:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
Consumer complaint comes in we could go
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
do a spot inspection and and and ensure
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
that there's compliance there deal with
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
any issues assist with investigation and
 
03:44:18.269 --> 03:44:18.279 align:start position:0%
bring that before the board so those are
 
03:44:21.510 --> 03:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:26.590 --> 03:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
there present R thank you Mr chair so
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
you said it was $100 an inspection so
 
03:44:32.149 --> 03:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
the the shop would pay that is that is
 
03:44:35.110 --> 03:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
that part of their annual uh license fee
 
03:44:36.510 --> 03:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
it is not part of the licensing fee it's
 
03:44:38.710 --> 03:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
a separate inspection fee okay so if
 
03:44:41.550 --> 03:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
someone from your office goes to inspect
 
03:44:44.790 --> 03:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
a shop they get a $100 bill they like oh
 
03:44:46.469 --> 03:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
we're inspecting you and that'll cost
 
03:44:50.070 --> 03:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
you $100 I mean it's it is scheduled in
 
03:44:53.750 --> 03:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
advance oh okay uh so yes but yes when
 
03:44:55.550 --> 03:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
when they go out and so again it's
 
03:44:57.389 --> 03:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
initial so opening a shop if you're
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
renewing it based on the two years and
 
03:45:02.630 --> 03:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
then what we would call a um I just lost
 
03:45:04.389 --> 03:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
the word I said it two minutes ago a
 
03:45:06.830 --> 03:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
routine inspection on that off year
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
right so not the renewal year okay um
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair so but you were saying
 
03:45:17.229 --> 03:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
now they could opt to have a uh a a you
 
03:45:19.269 --> 03:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
know a forever certification if they
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
take this course how much does that
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
course cost $59 $59 so it's actually
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
cost effective for them to take the
 
03:45:30.349 --> 03:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
course rather than having to renew that
 
03:45:33.349 --> 03:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
license thank you certainly I I don't
 
03:45:36.510 --> 03:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
know why you would pick the $200
 
03:45:40.349 --> 03:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
option uh some may though but we yes so
 
03:45:42.670 --> 03:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
then that in turn would provide cost
 
03:45:44.590 --> 03:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
saving to the shop owner but then it
 
03:45:46.830 --> 03:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
also could potentially um we would need
 
03:45:49.349 --> 03:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
fewer staff if many shops were choosing
 
03:45:52.269 --> 03:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
that the option to demonstrate that yeah
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say the language she's
 
03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
talking about is on page 75 I think of
 
03:45:58.910 --> 03:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 so you can see the whole process
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
there thank you we don't have I know
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't your area but did you say
 
03:46:05.630 --> 03:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
restaurants aren't even inspected
 
03:46:09.149 --> 03:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
annually I I I don't have anything to do
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
with the restaurants but I guess I was
 
03:46:12.750 --> 03:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
thinking where I eat my food where I eat
 
03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
my food I would say has fewer routine
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
inspections by the state than where you
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
get your haircut and I thought you know
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
I think public health and safety could
 
03:46:22.229 --> 03:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
still be guaranteed with a similar level
 
03:46:24.750 --> 03:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
of safety protocol again knowing that we
 
03:46:26.910 --> 03:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
have staff if there is a concern a
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
concern any consumer can file a
 
03:46:31.590 --> 03:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
complaint and then we could look into it
 
03:46:33.870 --> 03:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
I think restaurants are handled by local
 
03:46:45.429 --> 03:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:49.349 --> 03:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
okay all right well thank you very much
 
03:46:52.030 --> 03:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
director thank you happy to correspond
 
03:46:53.309 --> 03:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
via email with anything else that comes
 
03:46:56.469 --> 03:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
up all right we will all right let's go
 
03:46:59.030 --> 03:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
to we have here the board of tax and
 
03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:10.990 --> 03:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
153 and by the way Melissa when we
 
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the grand total for section
 
03:47:18.630 --> 03:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
one the whole difference is in other
 
03:47:20.710 --> 03:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
funds so is
 
03:47:26.670 --> 03:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
that um maybe the transfer of of money
 
03:47:29.670 --> 03:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
from um rooms and meals to
 
03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities got put into the budget
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
that wasn't before or something like
 
03:47:47.309 --> 03:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:50.670 --> 03:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so yes so I I did want to note the
 
03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
yeah so yes so I I did want to note the
change

03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:47:55.870 --> 03:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
um let me just look at make sure I just
 
03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
want to verify the fund is
 
03:48:10.429 --> 03:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
distribution that's actually general
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
um y That's agency income so that would
 
03:48:24.269 --> 03:48:24.279 align:start position:0%
be the big gap in other funds so in 24
 
03:48:26.110 --> 03:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 the municipal
 
03:48:29.070 --> 03:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
distribution in the treasury budget um
 
03:48:34.229 --> 03:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
141 was budgeted on book for fiscal year
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
2425 it was budgeted off book because
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
there was a dedicated Municipal Revenue
 
03:48:45.950 --> 03:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
fund that was created
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
in 26 and 27 the treasurer put it back
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
on the books so there's options because
 
03:48:54.990 --> 03:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
it is a dedicated fund now and it wasn't
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
prior that it could be removed and put
 
03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
it back off books because it is the
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund or you could leave it on
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
books but that is the big difference
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
because if you look on that page in
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 it's 131 million in
 
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 it's zero right and then
 
03:49:15.269 --> 03:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 26 it's
 
03:49:20.830 --> 03:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
39.7 in 27 it's 145. 6 so that is a big
 
03:49:22.630 --> 03:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
a big change and a big discrepancy when
 
03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're looking at those total um General
 
03:49:24.960 --> 03:49:28.189 align:start position:0%
you're looking at those total um General
government

03:49:28.189 --> 03:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:28.199 --> 03:49:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
lines

03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yep so it was there dedicated
 
03:49:38.229 --> 03:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal fund was created went off
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
books because of that dedicated fund and
 
03:49:42.910 --> 03:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
then the treasure put it back on the
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
books I believe she just does that every
 
03:49:46.830 --> 03:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
year here but you could move it off
 
03:49:49.229 --> 03:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
because it is a dedicated fund now and
 
03:49:51.670 --> 03:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
it never was a dedicated fund before
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%

03:49:56.990 --> 03:49:57.000 align:start position:0%

and stac um so we are Distributing a
 
03:51:05.670 --> 03:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
letter I can would be happy to do a
 
03:51:08.910 --> 03:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
brief overview of what the board is um
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
what we do and what we have presented
 
03:51:14.110 --> 03:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
for you today so the board is an
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
independent agency we hear cases from
 
03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
various State entities including appeals
 
03:51:21.229 --> 03:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
from municipalities the Department of
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration takings from
 
03:51:25.870 --> 03:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
either the Department of Transportation
 
03:51:25.880 --> 03:51:26.670 align:start position:0%
either the Department of Transportation
or

03:51:26.670 --> 03:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:51:30.149 --> 03:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities and other tasks including
 
03:51:34.590 --> 03:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
even in approving BFA Pilots um so at
 
03:51:36.630 --> 03:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
our core we go back a long ways we have
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of history we are a combination of
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
kind of three board functions a board of
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
tax review a Board of Equalization
 
03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the imminent domain commission um
 
03:51:50.110 --> 03:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
and as that has evolved through history
 
03:51:51.630 --> 03:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
we wound up being called the board of
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
tax and land
 
03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
appeals um we are a less formal venue to
 
03:51:59.550 --> 03:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
hear tax and imminent domain appeals um
 
03:52:03.990 --> 03:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
and play a key statutory role in looking
 
03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:04.710 align:start position:0%
and play a key statutory role in looking
at

03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
reassessments um and ensuring
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
proportionality and reasonable taxation
 
03:52:10.910 --> 03:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
in furtherance of our
 
03:52:13.630 --> 03:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
constitution um this is especially
 
03:52:15.070 --> 03:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
important right now at as what you all
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
know property values are
 
03:52:19.510 --> 03:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing um changing dynamically and
 
03:52:21.269 --> 03:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
governments including local governments
 
03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
are having a hard time meeting all of
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
their funding needs so therefore intense
 
03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
and economic pressures are being placed
 
03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
on both business owners and
 
03:52:34.070 --> 03:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners um so that is the core of
 
03:52:36.110 --> 03:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
um the intent is always to provide in a
 
03:52:40.710 --> 03:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
fair and impartial lowcost
 
03:52:43.389 --> 03:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
administrative appeal appeal process as
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
you will see in the materials that we've
 
03:52:47.790 --> 03:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
presented we've um identified a few
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
legislative mandates that we would like
 
03:52:52.030 --> 03:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
to either eliminate or tweak in order to
 
03:52:53.750 --> 03:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
bring efficiencies in but other than
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
that the budget we are asking your
 
03:52:58.229 --> 03:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
favorable consideration of is one that
 
03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
maintains our current approved Staffing
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
levels um and then maintains a baseline
 
03:53:06.670 --> 03:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
of of
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
expenses so for Staffing we have
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
proposed and um do you want to touch on
 
03:53:14.990 --> 03:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
the Staffing one
 
03:53:18.830 --> 03:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
or um I'll I'll do it at a high level
 
03:53:22.950 --> 03:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
and then um Miss delat can get into more
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
details but we have had a difficult time
 
03:53:29.149 --> 03:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
filling a statutory role of a tax review
 
03:53:31.469 --> 03:53:31.479 align:start position:0%
appraiser that position is presently
 
03:53:35.149 --> 03:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
vacant we want to keep that position um
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
but we have struggled to fill it because
 
03:53:39.030 --> 03:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
appraisers are in high demand they're
 
03:53:41.630 --> 03:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
going out and either working in private
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
Industries or for municipalities for
 
03:53:47.189 --> 03:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
more more money than we can offer so
 
03:53:49.149 --> 03:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
what our proposal is is to remove the
 
03:53:51.269 --> 03:53:51.279 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement that it be an
 
03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
appraiser and just have it be a position
 
03:53:55.990 --> 03:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
that is a technical staff
 
03:53:58.189 --> 03:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
position but which is at the discretion
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
of the board to fill with any um more
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
broadly um are appraisers licensed yes
 
03:54:04.720 --> 03:54:06.030 align:start position:0%
broadly um are appraisers licensed yes
they

03:54:06.030 --> 03:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:54:09.950 --> 03:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
are okay just for the benefit of the
 
03:54:13.870 --> 03:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
division this is on hb2 page 42 I think
 
03:54:15.469 --> 03:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
the stat statut
 
03:54:18.030 --> 03:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
changes yes the statutory changes
 
03:54:21.149 --> 03:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
proposed are in the trailer
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
bill um we propose one change to the
 
03:54:26.429 --> 03:54:26.439 align:start position:0%
imminent domain procedure act which is
 
03:54:29.070 --> 03:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
also already pending before um as House
 
03:54:29.080 --> 03:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
also already pending before um as House
Bill

03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
268 but the intent here is that we have
 
03:54:36.309 --> 03:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
a requirement in statute to hold
 
03:54:39.229 --> 03:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
imminent domain just compensation
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
hearings in the county where the taking
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
is occurring um the statute says to hold
 
03:54:46.710 --> 03:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
it in the respective County Courthouse
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
or other space as deemed suitable um we
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
cannot get cour houses to reliably give
 
03:54:56.429 --> 03:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
us space as far as hearing rooms so we
 
03:54:58.710 --> 03:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
just want to be able to use our hearing
 
03:55:02.510 --> 03:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
room in conquered in Johnson Hall um and
 
03:55:04.830 --> 03:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
remove that requirement that will reduce
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
State travel expenses at least in theory
 
03:55:09.309 --> 03:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
will reduce expense those expenses to
 
03:55:12.309 --> 03:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
some degree um and will reduce the
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
amount of time that we are spending as
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
as far as our technical as far as our
 
03:55:17.830 --> 03:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
clerical staff is spending trying to
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
find rooms out in the counties um and
 
03:55:24.870 --> 03:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
then lastly we are prepared to discuss
 
03:55:28.429 --> 03:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
our filing fees um but I think I will
 
03:55:31.469 --> 03:55:31.479 align:start position:0%
just open it up for questions all right
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
so let's start with on page
 
03:55:38.269 --> 03:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
153 so in 2024 were you m is this the
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
the missing um tax appraiser is that why
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
the salaries are lower
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
line 10 the class line
 
03:55:49.750 --> 03:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
10 uh
 
03:55:52.950 --> 03:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair that is exactly that
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
position has was vacant in the last bium
 
03:55:59.670 --> 03:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
um after very many unsuccessful attempts
 
03:56:02.670 --> 03:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
to post and fill it an interview we
 
03:56:05.830 --> 03:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
cannot compete um municipalities and
 
03:56:09.269 --> 03:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
they're paying 20 30 40,000 over what we
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
could pay we then went to personnel and
 
03:56:15.790 --> 03:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
worked with then um assistant
 
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Joe bushard he had found a
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
very old statute that we ended up going
 
03:56:23.469 --> 03:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
to GNC we moov some money into a class
 
03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
102 a contract class to try to contract
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
for services well unbeknownst to us that
 
03:56:31.630 --> 03:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
list is also small um of people that
 
03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
were willing to do contracts and of
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
course there's the timing of our appeals
 
03:56:40.590 --> 03:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
with the cases and um so we ended up the
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
contracts that didn't work out either so
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
then we're back to person Personnel
 
03:56:47.429 --> 03:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
working with director rudus uh who has
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
been ever so helpful and patient and her
 
03:56:53.309 --> 03:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
team and um they said we'd love to
 
03:56:55.830 --> 03:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
reclassify this for you to take out the
 
03:56:58.550 --> 03:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
license requirement to be able to get
 
03:57:00.309 --> 03:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
the high level technical skills and
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
analytics that we need however not
 
03:57:04.910 --> 03:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
require that license and she said but I
 
03:57:07.070 --> 03:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
cannot do that until we take it out of
 
03:57:08.830 --> 03:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
the you have to get it out of the law
 
03:57:10.269 --> 03:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
and then that gives us the greater
 
03:57:12.670 --> 03:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility and what I can tell you I
 
03:57:15.070 --> 03:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
have been
 
03:57:18.750 --> 03:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
when I started in 2002 we had we were an
 
03:57:22.750 --> 03:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
agency of 12 we are at an agency of six
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
I have two staff and this vacant
 
03:57:27.870 --> 03:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
position um
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
losing this
 
03:57:33.790 --> 03:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
position it it just we cannot function
 
03:57:38.110 --> 03:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
we need we need help um we have
 
03:57:40.710 --> 03:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
definitely not asked for a 7D in many
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
years we used to have two tax review
 
03:57:45.309 --> 03:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
appraisers and and some years ago I
 
03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
don't know 2011 maybe we we said you
 
03:57:48.990 --> 03:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
could take one out of the law so they
 
03:57:51.189 --> 03:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
did and then we had it filled with one
 
03:57:53.389 --> 03:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
and we were functioning and it was fine
 
03:57:55.710 --> 03:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
um but the reality is and I I will quote
 
03:57:57.149 --> 03:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
the Governor from yesterday I heard her
 
03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
say property taxes are a burden for many
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
gr Staters we hear that I hear that I
 
03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
talks to your taxpayers every day day in
 
03:58:09.429 --> 03:58:09.439 align:start position:0%
and day out and I tell you it is it's
 
03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's really getting to the point where
 
03:58:14.510 --> 03:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
we are the people that listen and we
 
03:58:17.070 --> 03:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
offer them the opportunity to be heard
 
03:58:19.389 --> 03:58:19.399 align:start position:0%
and what we're seeing more and more of
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
right now is there's an up uptick and
 
03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
reassessments and what's happening is in
 
03:58:27.990 --> 03:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
the reassessment field you have people
 
03:58:31.030 --> 03:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
that it's an aging profession people are
 
03:58:32.309 --> 03:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
aging out they're
 
03:58:34.269 --> 03:58:34.279 align:start position:0%
retiring they might some of them might
 
03:58:36.389 --> 03:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
come back and and contract with a couple
 
03:58:38.590 --> 03:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
of companies for part-time work but
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to be shortlived the
 
03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
reality is when I call do and folks over
 
03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
there in the RightWay division they're
 
03:58:47.030 --> 03:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
telling me they can't even get
 
03:58:48.630 --> 03:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
appraisers and they're Contracting with
 
03:58:51.389 --> 03:58:51.399 align:start position:0%
an outstate firm just to do and if you
 
03:58:52.990 --> 03:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
read the union leader this morning that
 
03:58:54.110 --> 03:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
was on the front
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
page uh that I had never heard of and
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
they appraiser list I asked for it for
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
purposes of Contracting and they said
 
03:59:03.870 --> 03:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
well we'll give it to you but don't
 
03:59:05.830 --> 03:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
bother because most of them are
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
retiring that's great but we still need
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
those services so we're going to try to
 
03:59:14.469 --> 03:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
repur we're hoping to be if we can the
 
03:59:16.990 --> 03:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
position to be able to reclassify it to
 
03:59:19.269 --> 03:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
do more investigating data collection
 
03:59:21.790 --> 03:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
doing analysis on spreadsheets our
 
03:59:24.670 --> 03:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
reassessment cases
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
um there we have all heard that the
 
03:59:30.790 --> 03:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
commercial properties are not
 
03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
appreciating like the
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
residential um you have some towns that
 
03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
cannot we have um and I I will use the
 
03:59:42.510 --> 03:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
town of colbrook as a prime example C
 
03:59:44.110 --> 03:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
Brook cannot find an assessor they they
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
cannot find a
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
contractor no one wants to go up and
 
03:59:49.349 --> 03:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
work up
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
there they're now exploring a TR toown
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
approach where maybe like what we have
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
over on the other side of the state
 
03:59:59.149 --> 03:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
where New London Sunapee and Newber I
 
04:00:02.110 --> 04:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
was going to say the tri towns um that
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
works well for you guys colbrook is
 
04:00:06.910 --> 04:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
trying to do something with other towns
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
to get an assessor so you either have
 
04:00:11.149 --> 04:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
people you know if you're if you're down
 
04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
in in Manchester and nashille they have
 
04:00:14.990 --> 04:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
in in-house accessor they're paid very
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
well um then you have contractors you
 
04:00:19.149 --> 04:00:19.159 align:start position:0%
have some local companies and you have
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
some out of state companies out ofate
 
04:00:23.469 --> 04:00:23.479 align:start position:0%
companies do things you know maybe a
 
04:00:25.550 --> 04:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
little bit differently too so there's a
 
04:00:27.870 --> 04:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
blend but we're there the board is there
 
04:00:29.790 --> 04:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure when those revals and those
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
studies get done and they don't
 
04:00:32.710 --> 04:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
something seems out of
 
04:00:35.590 --> 04:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
skew we need the technical skills to be
 
04:00:38.110 --> 04:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
able to Paw through 23,000 sales and
 
04:00:39.670 --> 04:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
figure out what
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
happened when you take a city like naswa
 
04:00:45.870 --> 04:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
who had I don't know it's over 60,000
 
04:00:48.950 --> 04:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
sales one year that's a lot and and we
 
04:00:51.469 --> 04:00:51.479 align:start position:0%
just we need that but we need to we have
 
04:00:54.790 --> 04:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
to be creative with How We Do It um so
 
04:00:56.510 --> 04:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh that is our hope to keep the position
 
04:00:59.710 --> 04:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise we are 90% General funded we
 
04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
are not net positive our filing fees we
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
could never be self-funded um we are 10%
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
Highway funds that is for the work that
 
04:01:11.429 --> 04:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
number does percentage does fluctuate
 
04:01:14.229 --> 04:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
when I was first here in 2002 it was 20%
 
04:01:15.590 --> 04:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's based on how many appeals of
 
04:01:18.469 --> 04:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
emminent domain are filed and um we're
 
04:01:20.950 --> 04:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
picking up back with the widening of 93
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
we we widen it widened up to uh exit
 
04:01:26.790 --> 04:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
exit 3 anyways and now we're we're
 
04:01:30.910 --> 04:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
starting to do the new 4 a ramp um so
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
we're seeing more takings this appraiser
 
04:01:36.149 --> 04:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
position we would use on imminent domain
 
04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
as well um and that was also very
 
04:01:40.950 --> 04:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
helpful for that so we are seeing an
 
04:01:43.910 --> 04:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
uptick in cases our case load Is Us
 
04:01:46.670 --> 04:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
usually um roughly we gave you a chart
 
04:01:48.990 --> 04:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
um just to show you over the last 10
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
years yeah let me ask about that chart
 
04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
yep so this is a
 
04:01:56.990 --> 04:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
360 350 or so cases per year are these
 
04:01:59.469 --> 04:01:59.479 align:start position:0%
cases filed or cases where the full
 
04:02:02.189 --> 04:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
board made a decision these are filed by
 
04:02:04.990 --> 04:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers these are filed okay um
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is that in a
 
04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
04:02:12.110 --> 04:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
cases um they're they're settled on the
 
04:02:14.309 --> 04:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
on the courthouse steps sort of right I
 
04:02:16.469 --> 04:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
mean that before you get to a full
 
04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
hearing and decision the parties settle
 
04:02:20.910 --> 04:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
frequently is that right or is that
 
04:02:23.790 --> 04:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
wrong we've always had um roughly on
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
average of 68% we've held pretty firm on
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
that 68% settlement rate the cases were
 
04:02:31.349 --> 04:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
left to here are the ones that need to
 
04:02:33.630 --> 04:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
be heard they're either issues of first
 
04:02:36.030 --> 04:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
impression um might have an interesting
 
04:02:38.189 --> 04:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
legal issue when it comes to exemptions
 
04:02:39.790 --> 04:02:39.800 align:start position:0%
or the like that's definitely what we
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
hear um otherwise we've had some comp
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
licated appraisal issues we have had
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
Hydro El electric facilities and I can
 
04:02:53.670 --> 04:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
tell you that was we have had 12 weeks
 
04:02:56.670 --> 04:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
at a time of different versions of
 
04:02:58.990 --> 04:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
electric and and generation facility
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
cases we have two weeks coming up in
 
04:03:03.630 --> 04:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
March for hydros again those are
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
complicated those take time um and we're
 
04:03:08.550 --> 04:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
having what the board does is when the
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
appeal is filed um our goal is to
 
04:03:14.030 --> 04:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
process that within a year meaning by
 
04:03:15.790 --> 04:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
the time you get there till decision and
 
04:03:18.429 --> 04:03:18.439 align:start position:0%
final resolution it's it's about a year
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
the court takes longer than that but
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
again we're hearing from from scratch
 
04:03:25.870 --> 04:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
this isn't a record review this is a
 
04:03:27.790 --> 04:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
full evidentiary they're allowed to
 
04:03:30.030 --> 04:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
bring in evidence and Witnesses and
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
trial you know it it is like we have
 
04:03:33.870 --> 04:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
because we have the same jurisdiction
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
with the Superior Court um we run it
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
very much the same in that way um but
 
04:03:42.189 --> 04:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
the complicated cases the cases the
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
hundred about that they hear a year
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
they hear roughly 100 um cases are not
 
04:03:48.990 --> 04:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily resolved in one year some
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
take multiple years reassessments could
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
go on for three or four years because
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
they're that complicated I always have a
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
rolling open case list of 7 to 800
 
04:03:59.830 --> 04:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
appeals depending on the given year when
 
04:04:03.309 --> 04:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
nashor or Manchester does a reval yeah
 
04:04:06.429 --> 04:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
it's a busy year um but there's a
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
constant we are our filing deadlines in
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
September so there's a constant rolling
 
04:04:13.469 --> 04:04:13.479 align:start position:0%
docket the docket never goes to zero but
 
04:04:16.229 --> 04:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
the cases they heard are roughly 100 a
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
year and they have always been the ones
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
that absolutely needed it okay so and I
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
understand the $65 filing fee hasn't
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
been changed in 50 years is that right
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
um well last time we we chatted um we
 
04:04:34.229 --> 04:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
sent over some data on that and it's let
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
me give me there one second um couple of
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
things I can offer you we attempted to
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
change that in 2009 with House Bill 47 6
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
at the time and that was in the 2009
 
04:04:49.630 --> 04:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
session with Representatives at the time
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh Betsy Patton and oh another person I
 
04:04:56.149 --> 04:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
jack but I can't think of his last name
 
04:04:58.750 --> 04:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
um parts of the bill there were 12
 
04:05:00.750 --> 04:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
places in law where IT addresses our
 
04:05:04.590 --> 04:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
filing fee and all of those did not
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
change um but parts of the bill we were
 
04:05:09.229 --> 04:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
trying to change the Quorum and a couple
 
04:05:11.229 --> 04:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
of other things um because at the time
 
04:05:13.309 --> 04:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
emminent domain part of the 90% of the
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
filing if he went back into the highway
 
04:05:18.149 --> 04:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
fund that is no longer the case so that
 
04:05:21.389 --> 04:05:21.399 align:start position:0%
we tried to get that changed in 2009 it
 
04:05:23.149 --> 04:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
did not go anywhere last time when we
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
met last bium um we gave an explanation
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
of how the filing fees sort of work and
 
04:05:34.189 --> 04:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
let me grab
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
that and I'm happy to provide that if
 
04:05:38.229 --> 04:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
you want I brought copies of what we
 
04:05:41.469 --> 04:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
submitted last time to to um address
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
that but basically the filing fees were
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
um because we as Eric stated we were a
 
04:05:53.710 --> 04:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
Tax Commission back prior to the 50s um
 
04:05:56.189 --> 04:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
the filing fees were based on how many
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
how many um owners uh then it went to a
 
04:06:03.510 --> 04:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
$40 fee in 1992 it was changed to 65
 
04:06:05.469 --> 04:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
that is where it sits today Emin and
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
domain has been $100 um at least since
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
we merged with the eminent domain
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
Commission in 1983 so 65 and 92 that's
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
where we're at we recommended $1100 um
 
04:06:18.429 --> 04:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
and in the last session when we were
 
04:06:20.510 --> 04:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
here two years ago we recommended maybe
 
04:06:24.349 --> 04:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh looking at assessments um over you
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
know maybe drawing a line and saying
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
anything over
 
04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
$750,000 of valuation could be one fee
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
and anything less than that could be
 
04:06:34.990 --> 04:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
something different um the board has its
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
authority to wave its fees they do that
 
04:06:39.389 --> 04:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
frequently with the elderly low and
 
04:06:42.269 --> 04:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
moderate um and that will always
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
continue so
 
04:06:48.590 --> 04:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.510 --> 04:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
um how much is in dispute on the 100
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
deciding well again because the chart at
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
the back of the letter shows you the
 
04:07:05.870 --> 04:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
almost 70 areas of jurisdiction that we
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
have they're not all necessarily
 
04:07:13.229 --> 04:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
valuation sometimes with especially with
 
04:07:15.870 --> 04:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
exemp ition it's it's about what's
 
04:07:20.189 --> 04:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
income what's not income um so I
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
can I I would really I don't even know
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
if we could get that out of a database
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
to get you the data but we see
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
properties in all ranges we had one the
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
other day what was that one it was like
 
04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
less than
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
200,000 what was we had a we had a
 
04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
60,000 um very recently so yeah is
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's the value of the property the
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
value of the property so the amount of
 
04:07:44.269 --> 04:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
tax on this property
 
04:07:48.550 --> 04:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
is 1,800 or something like that okay
 
04:07:52.389 --> 04:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
you're spending $10,000 a case on
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
average to process these cases you have
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
a 100 cases and you're spending a
 
04:07:59.229 --> 04:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars right so it makes no
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
sense to spend
 
04:08:04.950 --> 04:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
$10,000 on a case that where where 2,000
 
04:08:07.389 --> 04:08:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
dispute sure I appreciate where you're
 
04:08:12.750 --> 04:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
coming from I believe that the board's
 
04:08:14.269 --> 04:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
position is that we are supposed to be a
 
04:08:16.590 --> 04:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
lowcost alternative to the courts I I'm
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
not sure what the court would tell you
 
04:08:21.630 --> 04:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
for their cost per case if you were to
 
04:08:23.469 --> 04:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
do the math the way that you've done it
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
but whether you're appealing a $60,000
 
04:08:29.070 --> 04:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
property or millions of dollars in
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
utility company assets which we also
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
heard this last year um then you know
 
04:08:37.990 --> 04:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
doing an average like that I'm not sure
 
04:08:42.070 --> 04:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
case in the last year the utility
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
company assets out of Milton might have
 
04:08:48.030 --> 04:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
been the biggest case and I'm not
 
04:08:51.109 --> 04:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
remembering the exact figure but I can
 
04:08:54.309 --> 04:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
tell you last time we provided data we
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
had Granite Ridge versus londonairy 470
 
04:09:01.750 --> 04:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:06.269 --> 04:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
20 trying to I don't have a year uh
 
04:09:10.990 --> 04:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
2022 tax year um and just to further
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
clarify on our Form B when we submitted
 
04:09:16.750 --> 04:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
the budget um our we estimate our
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
current Baseline of appeals cost to
 
04:09:20.349 --> 04:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
process is
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
$232 our Target in 20 fiscal 27 would be
 
04:09:28.830 --> 04:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
roughly over 2400 um when we do the math
 
04:09:31.469 --> 04:09:31.479 align:start position:0%
but that's only when you count 300 cases
 
04:09:34.590 --> 04:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
not the actual 100 that
 
04:09:37.070 --> 04:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
are that are being
 
04:09:40.590 --> 04:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
decided oh sure it's it's the average
 
04:09:42.349 --> 04:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's actually based on 400 an average of
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
400 filed yeah because even though they
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
don't get to hearing they can still be
 
04:09:48.830 --> 04:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
processed in in a que doing other
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
procedures we don't just go to file to
 
04:09:52.990 --> 04:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
hearing we have other things that get
 
04:09:54.870 --> 04:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
done and that could take up to nine
 
04:09:56.750 --> 04:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
months before they get to hearing so
 
04:09:58.670 --> 04:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
there is still processing of these
 
04:10:00.510 --> 04:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
matters regardless if they settle at the
 
04:10:04.510 --> 04:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
11th Hour um okay yes and just like in
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
Superior Court they are entitled to
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
Discovery um and we have in property tax
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
appeals a mediation requirement because
 
04:10:12.349 --> 04:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
it is State policy to encourage
 
04:10:14.590 --> 04:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
settlement of adjudicated
 
04:10:18.149 --> 04:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
matters now when you have a $400 million
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
case what is how much is in dispute is
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
it one side saying it should be 390 and
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
the other one says it should be 410 or
 
04:10:29.189 --> 04:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
is it 400 versus 200 or something like
 
04:10:30.910 --> 04:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
that what is
 
04:10:34.429 --> 04:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
the I think it can vary pretty
 
04:10:37.149 --> 04:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
significantly yeah I sometimes I've seen
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
commercial properties where you know
 
04:10:41.710 --> 04:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
there they could be arguing over it
 
04:10:42.910 --> 04:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
could be a million dollar difference it
 
04:10:44.830 --> 04:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
could be $220,000 difference it depends
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:10:47.670 --> 04:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
appraisers which witness is more
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
credible and and which methodology of
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
how they got to their value is the board
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
finds is the most credible way to Value
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
the property it really does depend but
 
04:10:57.510 --> 04:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
there is always money on the table with
 
04:11:00.269 --> 04:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
the commercial properties for sure okay
 
04:11:04.630 --> 04:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
can you get us more like a a chart that
 
04:11:08.349 --> 04:11:08.359 align:start position:0%
shows in in the r in ranges you know we
 
04:11:11.469 --> 04:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
had we had 20 cases that were up to
 
04:11:14.590 --> 04:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
100,000 we had you know another 10 cases
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
that were up to 200,000 and so on you
 
04:11:19.910 --> 04:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
know yes half a million to a million a
 
04:11:22.269 --> 04:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
million to 5 million you know whatever
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's exactly what we did
 
04:11:26.189 --> 04:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
last time and I'm happy to re-update
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what we sent um we broke it down
 
04:11:31.149 --> 04:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
into four ranges going from 250,000 to a
 
04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
million and Granite Ridge was 470 that
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
was an outlier obviously I'm not sure
 
04:11:37.630 --> 04:11:37.640 align:start position:0%
what the hydros are are valued at but
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
all right represent do
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
that yeah you you went from a air fairly
 
04:11:47.149 --> 04:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
low low volume Court to one that's
 
04:11:48.830 --> 04:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
become very
 
04:11:51.790 --> 04:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
controversial the uh oap
 
04:11:55.510 --> 04:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
decision uh about not being allowed tax
 
04:11:57.870 --> 04:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
exemption just by being a charitable
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
organization was seized by some
 
04:12:02.830 --> 04:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
assessing company went around all the
 
04:12:04.950 --> 04:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
towns in my area saying we can make you
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of money by getting rid of these
 
04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions they came to my town they
 
04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
got rid of 24 tax
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
exemptions just on the strength of that
 
04:12:17.870 --> 04:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
decision which is not a court of law and
 
04:12:19.950 --> 04:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
now I'm fighting this battle for my
 
04:12:23.309 --> 04:12:23.319 align:start position:0%
organization which wasn't tax exempt
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
because of being a charal organization
 
04:12:27.309 --> 04:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
but because of an exchange they made
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
with the town which the idiots in the
 
04:12:31.630 --> 04:12:31.640 align:start position:0%
town didn't bother to Reas the reason
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
why we had a tax exemption they just
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
said oh you your a charitable
 
04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
organization would taken away and they
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
sent letter us to 24 organizations with
 
04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
very little research on why we had tax
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
exemption fighting it now but this
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
is this got way out of hand where's the
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
appeal from this decision and especially
 
04:12:54.670 --> 04:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
this company that's running around
 
04:12:56.590 --> 04:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
saying oh we'll make you a lot more
 
04:13:00.510 --> 04:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
taxes it's it's just wrong that suddenly
 
04:13:03.030 --> 04:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
blanket all 24 organizations that were
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
tax Exempted get letters say and you're
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
not including
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
churches veterans organizations all
 
04:13:12.389 --> 04:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
sorts of things so this this got way out
 
04:13:13.550 --> 04:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
of hand and ESP especially when it
 
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't a court of law so where is the
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
appeal for this
 
04:13:20.429 --> 04:13:20.439 align:start position:0%
decision well I'm I'm absolutely happy
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
to have that conversation and explain
 
04:13:27.630 --> 04:13:27.640 align:start position:0%
what happened um in that case and uh I
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
know when the board released that we had
 
04:13:32.830 --> 04:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
several conversations with the Senate
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
back a couple years ago when that
 
04:13:37.990 --> 04:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
happened and um once sort of um I don't
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
know if you've read the decision but I'm
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
happy to discuss that okay okay well
 
04:13:46.750 --> 04:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
where um the board at at that point um
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
again was the exemption laws chapter 72
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
in particular is one of the most
 
04:13:54.990 --> 04:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
difficult tax laws that I've personally
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
ever read it's very um in need of
 
04:14:01.790 --> 04:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
overhaul and I have been we've been
 
04:14:03.229 --> 04:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
trying to work with some Representatives
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
on that to bring a bill forward to try
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
to streamline the process um but this
 
04:14:10.950 --> 04:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
was about entities getting charitable
 
04:14:13.149 --> 04:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
exemptions without following the
 
04:14:13.159 --> 04:14:19.870 align:start position:0%
exemptions without following the
statutory

04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:23.389 --> 04:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
requirements always filed every
 
04:14:30.309 --> 04:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.429 --> 04:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
they all right uh representative G yeah
 
04:14:37.630 --> 04:14:37.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um the letter that you you
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
presented to us says that the board has
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.149 --> 04:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
and does that chat include all those
 
04:14:54.030 --> 04:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
four areas or not yes thank you yeah it
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
comes out to about 2400 bucks a
 
04:14:59.590 --> 04:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
case yeah well the case filed but not
 
04:15:01.630 --> 04:15:01.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily case finished anyways
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative evil and then
 
04:15:04.269 --> 04:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
representative rung and then we're going
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
to have to move on okay just just a
 
04:15:07.990 --> 04:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
couple of things I I think the whole
 
04:15:11.710 --> 04:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
concept of your uh group is that you
 
04:15:14.109 --> 04:15:14.119 align:start position:0%
provide a lower cost alternative to
 
04:15:17.550 --> 04:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
people that are trying to appeal tax
 
04:15:19.550 --> 04:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
decisions rather than going to the
 
04:15:22.630 --> 04:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
courts so even though we're talking
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
about the costs it still would be a lot
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
less than what it would be in the court
 
04:15:30.510 --> 04:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
and you have to give people some sort of
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
recourse right and to the person that
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
has $60,000 home and is's questioning
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
1,800 that's still a lot of money to
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
them so that's just a comment did you
 
04:15:42.030 --> 04:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
say that you you had a hand out there
 
04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
that had fee in
 
04:15:46.510 --> 04:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
information um I do it's two years old
 
04:15:48.550 --> 04:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to provide it I I don't
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
know I wouldn't mind seeing it I think
 
04:15:53.550 --> 04:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
it's interesting just discuss the fee
 
04:15:56.070 --> 04:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
issue seeing as they haven't been um
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
raised since whatever you said
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
1992 um yeah and then the other thing I
 
04:16:04.830 --> 04:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you just in the context of
 
04:16:07.870 --> 04:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
what the chairman just said the the what
 
04:16:11.590 --> 04:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
is the uh opportunity to appeal from the
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
tax appeals board to Superior Court or
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
what's the or is it turn cut off or
 
04:16:19.790 --> 04:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
what's the process no the appeal from a
 
04:16:22.070 --> 04:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
board decision in three of the four
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
areas is to the Supreme Court Supreme
 
04:16:27.070 --> 04:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
cour um in imminent domain matters then
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
they can appeal to the superior court
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
for a denovo trial there so there would
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
be two bites at the Apple before going
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court in the imminent
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
domain um procedure okay so their
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity is not cut off at the
 
04:16:40.560 --> 04:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
opportunity is not cut off at the
correct

04:16:43.990 --> 04:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.590 --> 04:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and if it would be helpful um
 
04:16:48.670 --> 04:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
I was in anticipation of talking about
 
04:16:50.590 --> 04:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
fees I can talk a little bit about fees
 
04:16:52.229 --> 04:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
and other states and neighboring states
 
04:16:54.269 --> 04:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
if that would be useful information does
 
04:16:57.870 --> 04:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
anyone do fees sliding scale based on
 
04:17:00.990 --> 04:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of dispute yes Massachusetts
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
I believe does sliding scale starting at
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
$65 and going all the way up to $500
 
04:17:08.469 --> 04:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
depending on the value
 
04:17:11.070 --> 04:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
appealed yeah still a tiny amount of
 
04:17:14.349 --> 04:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
money anyways go ahead represent
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
have two questions one is there uh if
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
someone's disputing their
 
04:17:22.109 --> 04:17:22.119 align:start position:0%
assessment how many of those cases May
 
04:17:24.030 --> 04:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
settle at the municipal level do you
 
04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
have before they even have to go to you
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
it seems as we can solve more problems
 
04:17:31.070 --> 04:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
at you know within that municipality to
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
spare some of the disputes that reach
 
04:17:34.590 --> 04:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
you so we do not actually have
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction unless they have disputed
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
their assessment at the municipal level
 
04:17:41.149 --> 04:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
and gone through a process there so in
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
order to even reach us they need to have
 
04:17:44.910 --> 04:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
disputed the assessed value at the
 
04:17:47.309 --> 04:17:47.319 align:start position:0%
municipal level okay so you would expect
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
that if
 
04:17:50.790 --> 04:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities had a
 
04:17:53.590 --> 04:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
thorough you know maybe some appeals
 
04:17:55.950 --> 04:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
process or recourse at the municipal
 
04:17:59.109 --> 04:17:59.119 align:start position:0%
level do anticipate it might reduce the
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.309 --> 04:18:05.319 align:start position:0%
you I think it would vary based on the
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
thoroughness of the review at the
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
municipal level um sometimes there are
 
04:18:12.510 --> 04:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
multiple levels of review when there's
 
04:18:14.229 --> 04:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
been a reassessment where they have an
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an informal hearing
 
04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
before even filing for an abatement um
 
04:18:21.870 --> 04:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
but I think the generally speaking I
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
think the more thorough the process at
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
the municipal level the more they can
 
04:18:26.830 --> 04:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
weed out the cases that are easy to weed
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
out um without them being appealed to
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
the state or the to either the board or
 
04:18:33.750 --> 04:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
the or the court okay and then uh just
 
04:18:35.950 --> 04:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
one question what are the qualifications
 
04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
for someone to be an
 
04:18:43.149 --> 04:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
assessor you know that um assessors are
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
are certified um under there's a Dr
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
rules that cover that what they have to
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
go to there's classes obviously training
 
04:18:54.030 --> 04:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
they have to come to a board hearing
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's they have to have mass appraisal
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
background I don't know off the top of
 
04:19:00.269 --> 04:19:00.279 align:start position:0%
my head uh it's been a long time since
 
04:19:01.710 --> 04:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
I've looked at those I know there
 
04:19:03.269 --> 04:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
there's some rumor that ASB might be
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
working on tweaking some of those and
 
04:19:08.189 --> 04:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
making it maybe um I don't want to use
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
the word easier but maybe changing some
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
of those um but I'm honestly I it's it
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
is a certification and there are
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
absolute criteria and quality buried in
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
some one of those rules that talks about
 
04:19:26.429 --> 04:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
those what what is required UMC overseas
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
that um yeah it might be now I I'm not
 
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
sure exactly how yeah that might have
 
04:19:33.790 --> 04:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
changed too I was just thinking of ways
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
we can encourage more people to go into
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
that field yeah I've heard people going
 
04:19:38.910 --> 04:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
to high school fairs believe it or not
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
trying to promote it as a career because
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's not known so okay thank you all
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
right so we have to move on to the
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%

04:20:14.269 --> 04:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:21.630 --> 04:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:24.030 --> 04:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah my name is David Rogers
 
04:20:25.830 --> 04:20:25.840 align:start position:0%

are here to um provide some information
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
about our our budget I will start off by
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
saying that we are in agreement with
 
04:20:43.469 --> 04:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
um almost every as aspect of of the
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed budget and and the
 
04:20:50.830 --> 04:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
riter um we provide a alternative um
 
04:20:53.109 --> 04:20:53.119 align:start position:0%
hearing process to the Superior Court in
 
04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
cases of appeals largely from local U
 
04:20:58.109 --> 04:20:58.119 align:start position:0%
Municipal zoning boards of adjustment
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
and planning boards um we provide a
 
04:21:04.870 --> 04:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
three- member board uh one attorney
 
04:21:06.269 --> 04:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
which is myself and then there are two
 
04:21:08.429 --> 04:21:08.439 align:start position:0%
other members with uh extensive
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and experience in both
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
engineering and planning so we provide a
 
04:21:14.429 --> 04:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
level of expertise that may not be
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
available at the superior court level
 
04:21:19.109 --> 04:21:19.119 align:start position:0%
which is the uh companion alternative
 
04:21:23.229 --> 04:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
appeal process for litigants um we have
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
also um a level of experience that um a
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
judge at the suprior court level may not
 
04:21:33.750 --> 04:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
have and we are not um redirected or or
 
04:21:36.910 --> 04:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
given other um tasks to complete which a
 
04:21:38.830 --> 04:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
superior court judge May encounter in
 
04:21:41.950 --> 04:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
the in the course of their work um we
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
are also last chair become a superior
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
court judge or was that he was not the
 
04:21:48.429 --> 04:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
chair but yes Michael class is now a
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
superior court judge and I understand
 
04:21:52.830 --> 04:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
he's been there just about a year uh
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
I've been on board as chairman uh with
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
the board since March of last year so
 
04:21:58.590 --> 04:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a relative newcomer and this is my
 
04:22:00.550 --> 04:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
first time before you folks so okay
 
04:22:03.030 --> 04:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
please bear with me but um I'm glad to
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
be here and to uh so some judges have
 
04:22:07.630 --> 04:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
experience right excuse me some judges
 
04:22:10.790 --> 04:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
have this experience yes and he does
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
when he's not hearing criminal cases or
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
other yeah right other competing factors
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
um so we we have a uh a well- comprised
 
04:22:22.710 --> 04:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
board um Miss manard has been with the
 
04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
board since its Inception several years
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
ago and is uh my go-to person when it
 
04:22:31.389 --> 04:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
comes to All Things uh logistical and
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
historical great institutional knowledge
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
and invaluable to our board um we
 
04:22:41.469 --> 04:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
provide um a speedier um hearing process
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
and decision- making proc process our
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
appeals are taken to the Supreme Court
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
and in the course of the existence of
 
04:22:50.189 --> 04:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
this board uh there have been
 
04:22:51.870 --> 04:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
approximately a dozen appeals to the
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court only been overturned twice
 
04:22:57.109 --> 04:22:57.119 align:start position:0%
so that's a fairly decent track record
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh even though I have very little of
 
04:23:01.870 --> 04:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
anything to do with that personally um
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
um it's a seasonal board in a sense um a
 
04:23:09.269 --> 04:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
lot of Planning and Zoning Board
 
04:23:11.030 --> 04:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
hearings at the local level are held
 
04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
more during the building and
 
04:23:14.309 --> 04:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
construction seasons in spring summer
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
and fall so uh we have received thus far
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
this year four appeals um but we
 
04:23:22.990 --> 04:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate receiving significantly more
 
04:23:25.950 --> 04:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
as time goes by we also provide a a a
 
04:23:28.189 --> 04:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
lower cost alternative for litigants to
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
come before us and and file their
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
appeals from various zoning and planning
 
04:23:34.750 --> 04:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
boards we also do not uh and we are not
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh we are directed by Statute to not
 
04:23:38.910 --> 04:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
substitute our judgment for that of the
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
local boards I know uh just what I
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
recall reading about the creation of the
 
04:23:45.710 --> 04:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board was that there was
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
some concern that it would become a
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
state level decision maker as opposed to
 
04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
a local level one and that has we are
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
adamant about avoiding that appearance
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
and and taking that route we do not do
 
04:23:58.710 --> 04:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
that at all we simply review what
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
happened at the lower level determine if
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable and lawful if it is we
 
04:24:05.149 --> 04:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
will generally affirm what happened if
 
04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:15.070 --> 04:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
more or less where we're at financially
 
04:24:18.429 --> 04:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the budget um we have we
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
were able to reduce the four or meet the
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
4% guideline uh from last fall and we
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
are prepared to move forward with the
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
budget as addressed by the governor in
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
her budget writer thank you so how many
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
cases per year and what fees are
 
04:24:38.149 --> 04:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
collected uh the fee is 250 250 the
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
filing fee is $250 that's a an
 
04:24:43.389 --> 04:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
all-inclusive fee uh that doesn't cover
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys representing parties or
 
04:24:47.349 --> 04:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
anything like that but our fee is 250
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
and we on average we get somewhere in
 
04:24:52.990 --> 04:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood of 25 cases per year um
 
04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
correction I'm sorry sorry over 30 30
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
closer to about 33 cases per year 33
 
04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
cases I'm sorry um so
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
it again we're we're we try to be as
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
efficient as we can with these and hear
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
them promptly and and render decisions
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
in a prompt way um given the makeup of
 
04:25:12.149 --> 04:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
the board over the last year there was
 
04:25:12.159 --> 04:25:13.830 align:start position:0%
the board over the last year there was
um

04:25:13.830 --> 04:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:15.389 --> 04:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
a couple of openings on the board for a
 
04:25:17.309 --> 04:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
period of time that disrupted things a
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
little bit but we have now gotten back
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
on track quite well and are moving
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
forward efficiently do you have any
 
04:25:22.880 --> 04:25:24.269 align:start position:0%
forward efficiently do you have any
appraisal

04:25:24.269 --> 04:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
appraisal
 
04:25:24.279 --> 04:25:26.149 align:start position:0%
appraisal
experience

04:25:26.149 --> 04:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
um I could tell you what a baseball
 
04:25:30.349 --> 04:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
cards worth maybe but uh that's that's
 
04:25:34.269 --> 04:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
about it okay representative Ms uh thank
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for uh joining
 
04:25:40.109 --> 04:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
us today um do do you have any sense at
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
all as to how much those
 
04:25:46.389 --> 04:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
33 uh individuals
 
04:25:49.990 --> 04:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
filing cases with you or claims with you
 
04:25:53.870 --> 04:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
are saving by going through the appeals
 
04:25:55.750 --> 04:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals process versus going
 
04:25:55.760 --> 04:25:58.349 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals process versus going
to

04:25:58.349 --> 04:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:00.750 --> 04:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
court I I would have to do some research
 
04:26:02.670 --> 04:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
on that I don't have a figure off the
 
04:26:04.750 --> 04:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
top of my head i' I've been an attorney
 
04:26:07.510 --> 04:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire since 1988 so I have
 
04:26:10.109 --> 04:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
been in private practice and uh have
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
worked for the state since 2005 is a
 
04:26:15.790 --> 04:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
hearing officer in various uh agencies
 
04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
um I know when my first appointment was
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
in 1993 by Governor merell to the
 
04:26:22.349 --> 04:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
workers compensation appeals board and I
 
04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
know that was created as similarly as an
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
alternative to the court system um not
 
04:26:30.149 --> 04:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
only as a financial um savings but it's
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
a time uh and efficiency savings it was
 
04:26:34.229 --> 04:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
years before they were getting hearings
 
04:26:35.950 --> 04:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
on workers comp cases and they created
 
04:26:38.229 --> 04:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
the board and it was reduced to months
 
04:26:40.349 --> 04:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
and uh it was quite a an improvement
 
04:26:42.910 --> 04:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
that board exists to today
 
04:26:45.269 --> 04:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question
 
04:26:46.830 --> 04:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative I would I would say that
 
04:26:49.229 --> 04:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
there's a significant enough savings I
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
mean many of the litigants have
 
04:26:52.670 --> 04:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys the towns obviously have
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
lawyers representing them and then I
 
04:26:57.070 --> 04:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
would guess it's upwards of probably 80%
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
75 to 80% of the um appellants or the
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
applicants have lawyers representing
 
04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
them um but again the the length of the
 
04:27:09.070 --> 04:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
proceedings the amount of um discovery
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
that goes on again we're a review board
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
so unlike the BT La that you just heard
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
from we don't have evidentiary hearings
 
04:27:17.790 --> 04:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have witnesses we don't have um
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
testimony uh there isn't Discovery and
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing that drives up
 
04:27:25.229 --> 04:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
litigation costs typically so um I would
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
venture to say that it is a a more cost
 
04:27:30.030 --> 04:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
effective and time effective manner of
 
04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
of appealing a local decision if I could
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
follow um oh go ahead if I may piggy
 
04:27:36.510 --> 04:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
back off of that on average it takes
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
about five and a half months from the
 
04:27:41.309 --> 04:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
date that a an appeal is filed with our
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
board to when a final decision is is
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
rendered so that's a significant cost
 
04:27:48.149 --> 04:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
savings and legal fees I would say
 
04:27:49.710 --> 04:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
compared to probably going through the
 
04:27:51.469 --> 04:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
Superior Court where your appeal could
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
take I don't know maybe a year or two to
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
conclusion you may have five and a half
 
04:27:58.149 --> 04:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
months go by without even seeing a
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
courtroom and I assume in your case
 
04:28:01.429 --> 04:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
there's very few
 
04:28:04.630 --> 04:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
settlements is that right we what we've
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
seen occa there are occasional
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
settlements that's accurate generally
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
speaking often when we get a hearing we
 
04:28:12.750 --> 04:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
remand it then there will be a
 
04:28:13.990 --> 04:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
settlement at that point because they
 
04:28:15.670 --> 04:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to necessarily come back or
 
04:28:17.070 --> 04:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
at least they have a sense of what a
 
04:28:19.229 --> 04:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
third party adjudicator would do and
 
04:28:20.469 --> 04:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
they can look at their case a little
 
04:28:21.790 --> 04:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
more objectively
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
usually so there are some okay
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative Ms followup yeah no I
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
guess where I was going is that you know
 
04:28:30.670 --> 04:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
if you've got if you got 33 cases a year
 
04:28:33.670 --> 04:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
and your annual budget is about you know
 
04:28:36.510 --> 04:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
$550,000 you know that's that's about 15
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
to $20,000 per case um and presumably
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
that would be that I I guess I'm trying
 
04:28:46.870 --> 04:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
to get a handle is that the kind of
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
expense that that all parties involved
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
in a in a in a proceeding would would
 
04:28:54.109 --> 04:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
would typically
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
spend I would think it could approach
 
04:28:58.990 --> 04:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
that in in in total you know between a
 
04:29:00.990 --> 04:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
municipality and a yeah and I think it's
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
important to look at both parties I
 
04:29:05.109 --> 04:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
didn't mean just the cost attorney fees
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
and drawn out nature of these things and
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
again the uh the length of time I I
 
04:29:10.950 --> 04:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the biggest savings
 
04:29:12.630 --> 04:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
it gives people the
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
decision more rapidly than it would if
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
it were limited to the Superior Court
 
04:29:18.359 --> 04:29:19.790 align:start position:0%
it were limited to the Superior Court
representative

04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
werk Mr chairman what sort of decisions
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
are you making versus what the uh tax
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
and land appeals looks at what's what's
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
the nature of the of the dispute yeah um
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
again we were hearing uh appeals of
 
04:29:37.070 --> 04:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
zoning board cases which are things like
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
variances special exceptions at the
 
04:29:42.109 --> 04:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
local level um planning board cases of
 
04:29:48.189 --> 04:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
of um you know building um development
 
04:29:50.349 --> 04:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
and and things of that sort so we we
 
04:29:53.309 --> 04:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
site plan work we don't get into the tax
 
04:29:55.389 --> 04:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
aspects of it I mean that may come up as
 
04:29:58.030 --> 04:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
a tangential thing but we don't uh
 
04:30:00.149 --> 04:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's not our focus by any means it's
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
it's more whether or not the local board
 
04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
has done what they are responsible for
 
04:30:06.109 --> 04:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
doing and that varies from town to Town
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
the municipalities have different
 
04:30:08.830 --> 04:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances so we have to look
 
04:30:11.070 --> 04:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
individually at each case and determine
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
if they follow their rules and if they
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
have then generally as I said we will
 
04:30:17.830 --> 04:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
uphold what happened below if they
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
haven't we'll send back some level of
 
04:30:22.030 --> 04:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
instruction and try to get them to
 
04:30:24.109 --> 04:30:24.119 align:start position:0%
follow their own rules better and and
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities are often uh I've had 12
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
years of experience on zoning and local
 
04:30:30.910 --> 04:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
zoning and planning boards in three
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
different towns and uh I found that
 
04:30:36.269 --> 04:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
there are personalities um to say the
 
04:30:38.670 --> 04:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
least um that's frequently an
 
04:30:40.670 --> 04:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
interesting and a healthy thing and it
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
brings different perspectives to the to
 
04:30:44.590 --> 04:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
the table but sometimes those
 
04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
personalities get in the way of making a
 
04:30:49.149 --> 04:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
decision that is necessarily proper
 
04:30:51.630 --> 04:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
under the ordinance so certainly
 
04:30:53.070 --> 04:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes in some of these cases the
 
04:30:55.229 --> 04:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
records are quite voluminous yeah I mean
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
they can span projects can span multiple
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
years and the certified records can be
 
04:31:02.070 --> 04:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pages long and sometimes our
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
decisions are five to six pages and
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes our decisions are anywhere
 
04:31:08.030 --> 04:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
from 12 to 13 we we had a hearing just
 
04:31:10.070 --> 04:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday that has nearly a thousand
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
pages of of record that came up up to us
 
04:31:14.710 --> 04:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
that we now have to review so it it's a
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
it can be a timec consuming process
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
that's not to say every single page is
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
relevant and important it's the other
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
one but we have to review that in order
 
04:31:24.910 --> 04:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
to determine that so so that's the bulk
 
04:31:26.950 --> 04:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
of your time it's not really sitting
 
04:31:29.790 --> 04:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
with the attorneys that might be a day
 
04:31:31.950 --> 04:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
or something the actual hearings
 
04:31:34.349 --> 04:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
themselves are relatively short they
 
04:31:35.910 --> 04:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're like appeals before The Supreme
 
04:31:38.590 --> 04:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
Court you know you have an a lot of time
 
04:31:40.590 --> 04:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
um we'll have a representative from the
 
04:31:43.389 --> 04:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
town speaking the appellant which may be
 
04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
the person who had initially applied for
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
a variance let's say or it may be an
 
04:31:48.590 --> 04:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
abutter in which case you'll probably
 
04:31:50.910 --> 04:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
have three parties the abutter the
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
property owner in the town um and we
 
04:31:55.149 --> 04:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
allow time for all those people to be
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
heard but frequently we're reviewing the
 
04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
record and that's the time consuming
 
04:32:03.070 --> 04:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
part of it so when we get to a hearing
 
04:32:04.990 --> 04:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
ideally we're familiar enough with the
 
04:32:07.469 --> 04:32:07.479 align:start position:0%
case having read through this stack of
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
documents that we can ask intelligent
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
questions if necessary of the parties
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
when they're before us and that's
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
largely what we do and then we go away
 
04:32:17.550 --> 04:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
and we deliberate among the three of us
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
as to how we want to proceed with this
 
04:32:22.030 --> 04:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
and and come to a conclusion as a board
 
04:32:24.790 --> 04:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
now sometimes there are it could be a
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
two to one decision it could be a
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
dissenting opinion at times I haven't
 
04:32:30.030 --> 04:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
experienced that personally yet but I
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
know that's a possibility and I've had
 
04:32:33.990 --> 04:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
other boards that did that uh but it's
 
04:32:36.670 --> 04:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
kind of remarkable how um you can kind
 
04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
of come to a consensus and again remand
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
is a an effective tool to educate local
 
04:32:43.510 --> 04:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
loal zoning and planning boards as to
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
what our take on their zoning ordinance
 
04:32:48.670 --> 04:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
is and hopefully get a better result at
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
the local level before they even reach
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
us so at the present you don't have any
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
unfilled positions all four positions
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
are full that's right okay and and um
 
04:33:01.510 --> 04:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
you're getting more computer work it
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
looks like transfers to
 
04:33:07.750 --> 04:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
oit yeah um up let Elizabeth explain
 
04:33:09.551 --> 04:33:09.561 align:start position:0%
that but um she was very instrumental in
 
04:33:11.349 --> 04:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
getting us a software program called
 
04:33:13.150 --> 04:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
Legal files which is used among other
 
04:33:15.551 --> 04:33:15.561 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state and it's designed
 
04:33:18.150 --> 04:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
to be a case management and operation
 
04:33:22.709 --> 04:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
software program we are also um adding
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
some hard new hardware not a lot um but
 
04:33:28.150 --> 04:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
we hold our hearings uh in a hearing
 
04:33:30.670 --> 04:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
room that is equipped with WebEx and it
 
04:33:33.310 --> 04:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
broadcasts not only locally but um
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
anybody can log in and the public can
 
04:33:36.750 --> 04:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
see it the hearings are open to the
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
public um so we're trying to improve the
 
04:33:44.349 --> 04:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh yes representative evil thank
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I have just a couple of
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
questions um so it's a threers board
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
correct okay and then unfortunately I
 
04:33:57.629 --> 04:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
don't have the RSA in front of me but
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
the RSA was very specific about the
 
04:34:03.269 --> 04:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for the board members to
 
04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that there are no conflicts
 
04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
have you been able to find people to sit
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
on the board in compliance with the
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
statute we fortunately have
 
04:34:13.830 --> 04:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh in fact one of the line items in our
 
04:34:15.869 --> 04:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
budget is for temporary board members
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
who are um appointed uh by the Supreme
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
Court um we submit their name and
 
04:34:24.269 --> 04:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
request that they be seated in cases
 
04:34:26.590 --> 04:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
where there are uh conflicts of interest
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
among board members permanent board
 
04:34:29.709 --> 04:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
members and we'll have a temporary
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
member who will then stay with that case
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
from outset to uh conclusion um and
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
fortunately we've been able to get um
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
whether it be a land surveyor
 
04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
professional engineer planning person
 
04:34:44.310 --> 04:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to do that because
 
04:34:46.189 --> 04:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that I've heard about
 
04:34:49.949 --> 04:34:49.959 align:start position:0%
the board is that there have been some
 
04:34:52.510 --> 04:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
issues well there were largely what
 
04:34:53.949 --> 04:34:53.959 align:start position:0%
happened and I'll just try to address it
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
briefly um last just about a year ago
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
when um Michael class was elevated to a
 
04:35:01.629 --> 04:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
Judicial position in the Superior Court
 
04:35:03.869 --> 04:35:03.879 align:start position:0%
the former chairman also resigned around
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
the same time so there were at 1.2
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
openings and suprem Court went through
 
04:35:10.390 --> 04:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
interviews I was part of that process
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
was um a appointed by the governor and
 
04:35:15.029 --> 04:35:15.039 align:start position:0%
um nominated and appointed by the
 
04:35:18.189 --> 04:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
governor in March of last year a a third
 
04:35:20.830 --> 04:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
member Stephanie bile was appointed in
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
April so we've had a full board since
 
04:35:25.470 --> 04:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
then I will say there's a bit of a
 
04:35:28.590 --> 04:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
learning curve there's a a getting up to
 
04:35:30.789 --> 04:35:30.799 align:start position:0%
speed with the procedures and the all
 
04:35:32.670 --> 04:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
the the various regulations and things
 
04:35:34.390 --> 04:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
that go along with it but as I mentioned
 
04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
earlier we are in a very good position
 
04:35:38.230 --> 04:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
right now compared to where we were just
 
04:35:40.990 --> 04:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
a year ago and that's you know I guess
 
04:35:42.670 --> 04:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
partly my fault because I'm a warm body
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
who's shown up at the hearings but um we
 
04:35:46.949 --> 04:35:46.959 align:start position:0%
have a complete board and for the most
 
04:35:49.629 --> 04:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
part our board has been intact but we do
 
04:35:51.551 --> 04:35:51.561 align:start position:0%
address conflicts of interest and we
 
04:35:53.990 --> 04:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
take those very seriously recusal is not
 
04:35:56.510 --> 04:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
something that we are um you know we
 
04:35:59.150 --> 04:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
refuse to do just because we are have a
 
04:36:03.629 --> 04:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
pride factor involved there yeah as just
 
04:36:05.470 --> 04:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
as I say under the RSA there were
 
04:36:08.310 --> 04:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
certain requirements for the people that
 
04:36:11.230 --> 04:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
were hired so that was part of my in
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
addition to just the issue of recusal
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
just the question of whether those
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications were met but as I say I
 
04:36:19.390 --> 04:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the RSA in front of me so I
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
just um had the question the other thing
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
is do you have any sense at all of how
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
many people are seeking the housing
 
04:36:30.670 --> 04:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
appeals board venue for their um appeals
 
04:36:33.070 --> 04:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
of local decisions as opposed to just
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to the superior court I I don't
 
04:36:38.189 --> 04:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
personally have statistics on that I
 
04:36:40.269 --> 04:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
would suspect I mean if I were advising
 
04:36:42.830 --> 04:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
a client who was an appeal they wanted
 
04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
to raise I would probably recommend the
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board just because it's
 
04:36:49.230 --> 04:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
more expeditious and and
 
04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
efficient you want to oh simly to your
 
04:36:56.269 --> 04:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
question representative RSA 6798 governs
 
04:36:58.349 --> 04:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
temporary board member appointment and
 
04:37:00.670 --> 04:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
you are correct um so the person who's
 
04:37:02.429 --> 04:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
appointed in place of a permanent board
 
04:37:03.869 --> 04:37:03.879 align:start position:0%
member has to have the same
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
qualifications for that board member who
 
04:37:05.680 --> 04:37:06.869 align:start position:0%
qualifications for that board member who
recused

04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
recused
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
themselves and we do have an A a list of
 
04:37:12.429 --> 04:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
a dozen or so people people that we call
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
on uh attorneys uh Professional
 
04:37:17.109 --> 04:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
Engineers land surveyors we've been very
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
fortunate in
 
04:37:22.029 --> 04:37:22.039 align:start position:0%
that yep so is there a fair amount of
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
money for Consultants or something like
 
04:37:26.551 --> 04:37:26.561 align:start position:0%
that in the budget
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
or if you if you got all these side
 
04:37:31.869 --> 04:37:31.879 align:start position:0%
people um I'm sorry representative are
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
are you referencing perhaps our um class
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
50 personal service temporary appointees
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:45.789 --> 04:37:45.799 align:start position:0%
um I don't see
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
consult we've been fortunate I would say
 
04:37:50.429 --> 04:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
in that um the number of times board
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
members have had to recuse themselves uh
 
04:37:55.070 --> 04:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
has been Limited in the past with of
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
course the of the uh exception where we
 
04:37:59.949 --> 04:37:59.959 align:start position:0%
lost two of our board members right
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
around the same time last year so I
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
think that this is a a fair estimate for
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
um necessary funds to cover our
 
04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
temporary board
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
members and um to that effect RSA 798
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
also governs compensation for temporary
 
04:38:16.990 --> 04:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
board members and they are paid on a per
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
DM rate at75 whopping dollars a
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
day I
 
04:38:26.670 --> 04:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
think I'm glad you think
 
04:38:29.230 --> 04:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
that oh
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
wrong all right all right other
 
04:38:42.029 --> 04:38:42.039 align:start position:0%
questions no no okay
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:50.830 --> 04:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
time um probably not but I'm not ready
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.150 --> 04:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
this goad could we have a little I mean
 
04:38:59.910 --> 04:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
most of the folks that come in here and
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
talk to us they present they have
 
04:39:03.949 --> 04:39:03.959 align:start position:0%
something that has some statistical
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
information on if we could just have a
 
04:39:08.230 --> 04:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
little more information about your the
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
number of cases you have and that sort
 
04:39:12.789 --> 04:39:12.799 align:start position:0%
of happy to prepare that would that
 
04:39:14.910 --> 04:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful rather than
 
04:39:16.990 --> 04:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
we're just operating sort of in a vacuum
 
04:39:18.429 --> 04:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer I was hoping you would ask
 
04:39:20.990 --> 04:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
because I I loveing I'm a lawyer too so
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
there you go so I write it in leg and
 
04:39:25.869 --> 04:39:25.879 align:start position:0%
you'll understand it that's good right
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
um and and just as far as my question
 
04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
about the um qualifications of the board
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
members and that that would be help
 
04:39:35.230 --> 04:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and is it an outcome
 
04:39:38.470 --> 04:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily for the town for the
 
04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
applicant or is there sometimes you know
 
04:39:43.628 --> 04:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
split the baby kind of thing
 
04:39:46.110 --> 04:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess splitting the baby is what a
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
remand would do and and we have a choice
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
with remands we can vacate and remand
 
04:39:52.948 --> 04:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
meaning we wipe out the entire decision
 
04:39:56.670 --> 04:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
and say start all over again or we um
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
reverse and say well it's not really
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
right but you know try again and we're
 
04:40:03.150 --> 04:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
getting to a point where we're trying to
 
04:40:06.430 --> 04:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
be a little more direct in instructing a
 
04:40:08.550 --> 04:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
zoning Board of where we feel they their
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
shortcomings were or a planning board
 
04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
that is up to them to you know
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate into their decisions and um
 
04:40:18.270 --> 04:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
their rehearing process um but yeah
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do some education in
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
fact U few weeks ago we met during the
 
04:40:25.070 --> 04:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
employee meet and greet with governor
 
04:40:28.230 --> 04:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
aot and we mentioned we said we were all
 
04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
there all four of us and she was very um
 
04:40:32.910 --> 04:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
encouraged by our presence and the
 
04:40:35.628 --> 04:40:35.638 align:start position:0%
board's role and what she thought would
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
be important of us educating local
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities as to the zoning board
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
and um housing or uh planning board
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
process where that would encourage
 
04:40:47.830 --> 04:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
development more at the local level we
 
04:40:50.150 --> 04:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't take a as I say a direct role in
 
04:40:52.430 --> 04:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
telling towns exactly what to do but we
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
can give them some education and
 
04:40:57.270 --> 04:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
directive as to how we analyze things
 
04:40:58.750 --> 04:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
and review things and then hopefully
 
04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
they can address that at the local level
 
04:41:04.150 --> 04:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay so when you give us a table make it
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's a column which is
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
outcome for the town for the applicant
 
04:41:12.510 --> 04:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
for remand yeah with IAL remand without
 
04:41:14.350 --> 04:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
or whatever however you want to do it we
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
will certainly sit down and do that for
 
04:41:18.430 --> 04:41:18.440 align:start position:0%

class 11 is the annual salary uh budget
 
04:49:23.948 --> 04:49:23.958 align:start position:0%

they're no they do not get benefits it's
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
one of those things where they could but
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
they would have to pay the full amount
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
themselves I
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
see okay good did you get married is
 
04:50:03.150 --> 04:50:03.160 align:start position:0%

04:50:06.990 --> 04:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
um no the um kids I have I have kids and
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
um congrat something had happened and I
 
04:50:12.548 --> 04:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
lost and no no all grown so something
 
04:50:15.150 --> 04:50:15.160 align:start position:0%

them got removed and I was like well
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%

them all back on because it'll be a
 
04:50:23.470 --> 04:50:23.480 align:start position:0%

introduce yourself well I am Thomas FC
 
05:16:24.590 --> 05:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the office of the right to know
 
05:16:27.510 --> 05:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman also known as the RKO as a
 
05:16:29.910 --> 05:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I'm the entirety of the
 
05:16:33.350 --> 05:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
ABC uh known as the RKO which
 
05:16:36.830 --> 05:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
is that too uh which is relatively new
 
05:16:40.270 --> 05:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
and busy office for a new agent anyway
 
05:16:41.948 --> 05:16:41.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for having me here today
 
05:16:44.030 --> 05:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe I'll have the simplest but one
 
05:16:45.868 --> 05:16:45.878 align:start position:0%
of the most perplexing agency budget
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
presentations that you've had uh I first
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
staff the office in uh on January 27
 
05:16:55.310 --> 05:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
2023 it's presently set by law to expire
 
05:16:58.470 --> 05:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
on July 1 2025 unless renewed funded and
 
05:17:00.628 --> 05:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
staffed By Me Or Another appointee prior
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
to that date that being the case the
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
budget under consideration is for a
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
period when the agency might or might
 
05:17:08.910 --> 05:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
not exist there's currently a bill in
 
05:17:10.990 --> 05:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
house house bill 111 which if it's
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
passed would extend the life of the
 
05:17:15.990 --> 05:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
agency for 2 years uh that came out of
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary uh autop pass with
 
05:17:21.390 --> 05:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh I know the committee's had
 
05:17:25.548 --> 05:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
a busy day so I will actually be be
 
05:17:28.430 --> 05:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
brief and turn the page did the did the
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
amendment change the uh it didn't change
 
05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
the extension of the agency for two
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
years it uh addressed um some of the
 
05:17:41.910 --> 05:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
things that I could do it uh I believe
 
05:17:44.430 --> 05:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
that it said that it would not have the
 
05:17:47.830 --> 05:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
authority to uh award attorney's fees it
 
05:17:50.070 --> 05:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
also specified that people that appear
 
05:17:55.110 --> 05:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
before me who are not attorneys aren't
 
05:17:55.120 --> 05:17:56.470 align:start position:0%
before me who are not attorneys aren't
subject

05:17:56.470 --> 05:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
subject
 
05:18:00.190 --> 05:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
to uh problems for the unauthorized
 
05:18:02.510 --> 05:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
practice of law those two things were
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
added great right thank you so uh I'm a
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial agency existing in the ex
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
itive Branch charged by the legislature
 
05:18:13.510 --> 05:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
with resolving disputes between a member
 
05:18:16.230 --> 05:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
of the public and a governmental or a
 
05:18:18.350 --> 05:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
public body or public agency regarding
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
disputes that arise under RSA 91a which
 
05:18:24.430 --> 05:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
is the right to no law I won't describe
 
05:18:27.230 --> 05:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
all that that entails but I brought with
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
me copies of my office's first annual
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
report which actually covers activities
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
from when the agency began until
 
05:18:35.070 --> 05:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
December 31st
 
05:18:37.590 --> 05:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
2024 as of this morning you can also
 
05:18:39.910 --> 05:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
find that online
 
05:18:41.830 --> 05:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
the portions of the report that briefly
 
05:18:44.590 --> 05:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
relate to agency budgetary matters are
 
05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
at Pages 84 and
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
35 as to the budget that's been proposed
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
I appear at Pages 125 and 126 the
 
05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended operating budget
 
05:18:57.868 --> 05:18:57.878 align:start position:0%
the primary expenses of my office are my
 
05:19:00.910 --> 05:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits Uh current expenses
 
05:19:02.990 --> 05:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
requested for the bium that you're
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
looking at now are $3,000
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
$4,000 uh that's primarily for postage
 
05:19:11.590 --> 05:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
and miscellaneous office
 
05:19:13.670 --> 05:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
supplies I now have my own
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules my website but it's
 
05:19:18.270 --> 05:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
been my experience that the nature and
 
05:19:20.990 --> 05:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
the functions of my office are sometimes
 
05:19:23.590 --> 05:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstood and uh it I spend a good
 
05:19:26.270 --> 05:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
deal of time addressing email and
 
05:19:28.628 --> 05:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
walk-in inquiries which poses something
 
05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
of a difficulty for a one-man neutral
 
05:19:33.510 --> 05:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
decision maker one of the things that
 
05:19:35.150 --> 05:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
was raised in the course of public
 
05:19:37.788 --> 05:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
comments during my Ru making with uh my
 
05:19:39.230 --> 05:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
agency Ru making
 
05:19:40.910 --> 05:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
is that it would be generally helpful to
 
05:19:42.990 --> 05:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
produce something like a user's guide
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
explaining what my office does how it
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
functions and its processes
 
05:19:48.708 --> 05:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
administrative rules are out there but
 
05:19:49.990 --> 05:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
administrative rules have to be written
 
05:19:52.110 --> 05:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
a particular way and uh sometimes people
 
05:19:54.430 --> 05:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
find it a little daunting to get through
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
so the suggestion was that I create a
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
users's guide in this budget uh there is
 
05:20:01.510 --> 05:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
a request uh for funds to retain an
 
05:20:04.150 --> 05:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
independent contractor a legal intern to
 
05:20:06.190 --> 05:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
assist in the creation of a user's guide
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
and potentially Aid in some other
 
05:20:09.788 --> 05:20:09.798 align:start position:0%
operations the office such as answering
 
05:20:12.190 --> 05:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of inquiries that I
 
05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
Reed there you'll see that there is $1
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
allocated for personnel uh for Personnel
 
05:20:19.190 --> 05:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
Services and that's so that there's a
 
05:20:22.270 --> 05:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
line for potentially a part-time
 
05:20:24.110 --> 05:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
employee should it ever be determined
 
05:20:26.510 --> 05:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
that the state budget could absorb that
 
05:20:28.830 --> 05:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
ideally the office if the office is
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
continue is to continue into the future
 
05:20:34.190 --> 05:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
It ultimately likely needs at least one
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
other person in capable of Performing
 
05:20:38.030 --> 05:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
all of my functions on at least
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
part-time basis bis and I say that
 
05:20:43.548 --> 05:20:43.558 align:start position:0%
because I'm a oneman neutral decision
 
05:20:46.590 --> 05:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
maker if I have a conflict on a case I
 
05:20:49.070 --> 05:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
have to recuse myself from that case
 
05:20:52.270 --> 05:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
there's nobody else that can pick it up
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh there might need to be a statutory
 
05:20:57.430 --> 05:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment if there's if that's to occur
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
at some point um because it says that
 
05:21:03.948 --> 05:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
the Ombudsman makes decisions so this is
 
05:21:05.910 --> 05:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
a full-time job right why would you have
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
a conflict it it's it's a little more
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
than the fulltime job yes but why would
 
05:21:12.750 --> 05:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
you have a conflict in that case uh if
 
05:21:14.310 --> 05:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
if something happens in the case I don't
 
05:21:16.230 --> 05:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
believe that I can address it fairly I
 
05:21:19.830 --> 05:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
have to recuse myself if I was involved
 
05:21:21.990 --> 05:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
with one of the parties I would have to
 
05:21:24.390 --> 05:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
recuse myself financially involved
 
05:21:26.190 --> 05:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
primarily Oh you mean like your brother
 
05:21:28.948 --> 05:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
had a case a real conflict of interests
 
05:21:30.548 --> 05:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
and I I did I had one case in which I
 
05:21:32.110 --> 05:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
did not believe that I could judge a
 
05:21:33.548 --> 05:21:33.558 align:start position:0%
case fairly based on the things that
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
happened in the case and I had to accuse
 
05:21:37.470 --> 05:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
myself and the question then is what
 
05:21:39.430 --> 05:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
happens I said well new agency I guess
 
05:21:40.990 --> 05:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to find out because I have
 
05:21:43.510 --> 05:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
to accuse myself if I I'm subject to a
 
05:21:46.548 --> 05:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
lot of codes of conduct as an attorney
 
05:21:51.510 --> 05:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I if I'm off I'm off so that's
 
05:21:54.788 --> 05:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
one of the things and and another
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
individual would also be able to assist
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
in things like getting out basic notices
 
05:22:02.990 --> 05:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
things like that uh but I did not put
 
05:22:06.270 --> 05:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
that in uh as a request here because I
 
05:22:08.070 --> 05:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a budget that is
 
05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
focusing on reduction rather than
 
05:22:10.320 --> 05:22:12.110 align:start position:0%
focusing on reduction rather than
expansion

05:22:12.110 --> 05:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
05:22:16.270 --> 05:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
um so but ideally that that and an
 
05:22:18.110 --> 05:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant would probably
 
05:22:21.390 --> 05:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
be of great use to my agency or to me
 
05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
personally which is basically the same
 
05:22:24.000 --> 05:22:27.390 align:start position:0%
personally which is basically the same
thing

05:22:27.390 --> 05:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:30.110 --> 05:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
um well I just wish the I wanted the
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
committee to be aware of that um so what
 
05:22:39.150 --> 05:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
I'm requesting here is uh consultant
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
expenses for basically the users guide
 
05:22:43.628 --> 05:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
some additional assistance and some of
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
the other some of the other things that
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
I haven't been able to get around to
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
maybe an intern maybe that help get
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
people a little bit more informed about
 
05:22:53.948 --> 05:22:53.958 align:start position:0%
what I do maybe spread the word about
 
05:22:53.958 --> 05:22:54.910 align:start position:0%
what I do maybe spread the word about
the

05:22:54.910 --> 05:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:58.430 --> 05:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
agency uh you'll see that in my in my
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
budget there's no allocation for things
 
05:23:03.470 --> 05:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
like office expense uh I'm office space
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
expense that's because my agency is
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to Department
 
05:23:10.150 --> 05:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
of State uh I operate independently of
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
them but uh they have assigned me space
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
which I would assume is absorbed in
 
05:23:20.830 --> 05:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
their budget as opposed to my budget and
 
05:23:23.390 --> 05:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
right now I'm in uh room 12 of the State
 
05:23:25.990 --> 05:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
House Annex down the basement uh this
 
05:23:28.350 --> 05:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
budget assumes that uh my relationship
 
05:23:29.990 --> 05:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state will
 
05:23:32.628 --> 05:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
continue in that way so that's why I
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't see that in
 
05:23:37.150 --> 05:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
there as to
 
05:23:39.868 --> 05:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
reductions uh I have from the beginning
 
05:23:43.110 --> 05:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
I have sincerely attempted to keep my
 
05:23:45.470 --> 05:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
offices expenditures to the bare minimum
 
05:23:50.190 --> 05:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
required in order to perform the job um
 
05:23:52.830 --> 05:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
in order to really attempt to identify
 
05:23:55.150 --> 05:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
the agency's most basic
 
05:23:57.670 --> 05:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
needs um from the time officer's first
 
05:24:00.670 --> 05:24:00.680 align:start position:0%
staff till December 21st 2024
 
05:24:02.788 --> 05:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous expenditures other than
 
05:24:05.430 --> 05:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
postage amounted to under
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
$5,000 uh with the caveat the Department
 
05:24:10.270 --> 05:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
of State has been picking up office
 
05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
space and so
 
05:24:14.190 --> 05:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
forth at this point I don't believe that
 
05:24:16.270 --> 05:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
the proposed budget is uh reasonably
 
05:24:18.590 --> 05:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
capable of uh much further reduction
 
05:24:20.350 --> 05:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
without eliminating me
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
entirely uh couple of new items are
 
05:24:24.670 --> 05:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
found in there request are $500 in
 
05:24:27.708 --> 05:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
instate travel all my hearings in 2023
 
05:24:30.190 --> 05:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
and 2024 have been held in conquered
 
05:24:31.830 --> 05:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes to the annoyance of some of
 
05:24:34.750 --> 05:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
the participants uh last month I did
 
05:24:37.750 --> 05:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
travel for a hearing on the road and uh
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
I'm considering doing that again in the
 
05:24:40.830 --> 05:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
future if it's warranted in a particular
 
05:24:43.350 --> 05:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
case and at present uh the travel that I
 
05:24:45.310 --> 05:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
would do for the agency is at my
 
05:24:45.320 --> 05:24:46.310 align:start position:0%
would do for the agency is at my
personal

05:24:46.310 --> 05:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
personal
 
05:24:48.510 --> 05:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
expense uh for equipment I'm hoping to
 
05:24:51.948 --> 05:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
get uh a a lockbox uh for the filing of
 
05:24:55.310 --> 05:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
in-person uh fees for filing a case my
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
fees are $25 that's
 
05:25:01.708 --> 05:25:01.718 align:start position:0%
statutory um and also for filing of uh
 
05:25:04.310 --> 05:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
pleadings and so forth right now people
 
05:25:06.270 --> 05:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
walk in and hand things to me or I or
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
the door which remains
 
05:25:11.708 --> 05:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
unlocked folks come in and put stuff on
 
05:25:14.470 --> 05:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
my desk so I'm hoping to get things like
 
05:25:16.910 --> 05:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
that perhaps a backup uh recording
 
05:25:19.868 --> 05:25:19.878 align:start position:0%
device right now I'm using a a uh
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
cassette tape recorder for my home um
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
and with the tapes paid for by the state
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the expenses but the
 
05:25:30.430 --> 05:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
recorder itself is is mine okay um you
 
05:25:33.548 --> 05:25:33.558 align:start position:0%
said fees are $25 how many cases a year
 
05:25:36.750 --> 05:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
roughly uh since I have started well
 
05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
let's see I could tell you that had I
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
divide my stuff into two categories
 
05:25:45.070 --> 05:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
inquiries which is people contacting me
 
05:25:46.708 --> 05:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
about anything it could be I want to
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
file this I want to do that I want to
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
know how you work it could be a press
 
05:25:50.910 --> 05:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry it could be a right to no
 
05:25:53.470 --> 05:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
request itself I've had 282 of those
 
05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
since I started of those
 
05:26:02.030 --> 05:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
282 as of today I believe it's 78 filed
 
05:26:06.510 --> 05:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
cases so the 282 don't pay the $25 fee
 
05:26:10.110 --> 05:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
that's no no no they don't okay the $25
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
fee just comes from the file cases which
 
05:26:15.670 --> 05:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
so that's that's 78 cases over 23 months
 
05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
since whatever January 27 2023 to now
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
is gotcha all right I guess that's
 
05:26:26.430 --> 05:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
that's even two
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
years yeah so it's slightly more than
 
05:26:30.990 --> 05:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
two years 24 months slightly I started I
 
05:26:33.390 --> 05:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
started the middle of a budget cycle so
 
05:26:35.590 --> 05:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
this is actually the first round of
 
05:26:38.708 --> 05:26:38.718 align:start position:0%
budgets in which I've had input now on
 
05:26:42.110 --> 05:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
these cases do you always give a
 
05:26:45.190 --> 05:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
decision or do they sometimes settle oh
 
05:26:47.628 --> 05:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
uh a good number one of the things RSA
 
05:26:52.270 --> 05:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
541 a38 is uh provides that uh it's
 
05:26:53.590 --> 05:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
really the policy of the state to
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
encourage informal disposition of cases
 
05:26:59.310 --> 05:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
and I try to I try to encourage that and
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
I I state right out that I encourage
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
that usually if that occurs it occurs at
 
05:27:06.190 --> 05:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
a prehearing conference or after
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
prehearing conference uh most cases end
 
05:27:10.310 --> 05:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
up at a prehearing conference not all
 
05:27:13.110 --> 05:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
cases but many uh the other thing that I
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
found is that uh the offices mere
 
05:27:18.948 --> 05:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
existence may help to resolve cases and
 
05:27:21.230 --> 05:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
by that I mean I've had I've had people
 
05:27:23.430 --> 05:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
for example that just see see me
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
something they're sending to a
 
05:27:27.470 --> 05:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
governmental unit and uh that way they
 
05:27:30.830 --> 05:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
know that something might happen unless
 
05:27:35.150 --> 05:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
they can resolve it so yeah I I I'm not
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
sure what the exact number is about the
 
05:27:39.990 --> 05:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
number that resolve themselves and the
 
05:27:43.548 --> 05:27:43.558 align:start position:0%
number that resolve with my input but
 
05:27:46.990 --> 05:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
it's a fair amount okay half maybe here
 
05:27:48.548 --> 05:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
something I I really don't want to make
 
05:27:52.030 --> 05:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
a guess okay fine
 
05:27:52.040 --> 05:27:55.590 align:start position:0%
a guess okay fine
um

05:27:55.590 --> 05:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:55.600 --> 05:27:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:02.150 --> 05:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
um how long I guess how how complicated
 
05:28:03.868 --> 05:28:03.878 align:start position:0%
are these cases how much time does it
 
05:28:07.310 --> 05:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
take you to uh to deal with one I have
 
05:28:10.030 --> 05:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
to say that that really depends on the
 
05:28:12.430 --> 05:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
case and the parties involved the
 
05:28:14.070 --> 05:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
quickest anything has been in and out
 
05:28:16.510 --> 05:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
has been eight days I still have some
 
05:28:17.708 --> 05:28:17.718 align:start position:0%
cases from
 
05:28:20.070 --> 05:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
2023 and it all depends on the cases and
 
05:28:22.030 --> 05:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
what happens in them there you know any
 
05:28:24.230 --> 05:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
case you can file motions of different
 
05:28:26.310 --> 05:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
types motions to compel motions for me
 
05:28:28.430 --> 05:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
to do an in- camera review as a matter
 
05:28:30.270 --> 05:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
of fact my first case which came in
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
almost immediately was to do an in
 
05:28:34.510 --> 05:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
camera review in that case in camera
 
05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
review means that I view I I take a look
 
05:28:38.670 --> 05:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
at something that's been withheld
 
05:28:40.110 --> 05:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
and make a determination about whether
 
05:28:43.270 --> 05:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
it should be released the um the first
 
05:28:45.150 --> 05:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
case that I had was 700 pages of
 
05:28:46.910 --> 05:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
redacted material that I had to sit down
 
05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
and go through and figure out whether or
 
05:28:51.270 --> 05:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
not each redaction was proper on the
 
05:28:54.430 --> 05:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
other hand there are some requests for
 
05:28:57.948 --> 05:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
uh for uh in camera review that it's
 
05:28:59.910 --> 05:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
just a page and that's
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
fast sometimes it takes
 
05:29:06.270 --> 05:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
months so does the governmental agency
 
05:29:08.190 --> 05:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
that the person is having the dispute
 
05:29:11.030 --> 05:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
with always give you the DAT the
 
05:29:13.548 --> 05:29:13.558 align:start position:0%
information that the person wants or not
 
05:29:15.750 --> 05:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily not necessarily it really
 
05:29:18.230 --> 05:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
depends in the case um sometimes people
 
05:29:21.110 --> 05:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
are just complaining about the and this
 
05:29:23.310 --> 05:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
is probably the most common complaint is
 
05:29:26.910 --> 05:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
that there's not a timely response and
 
05:29:30.150 --> 05:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
for that those cases can get resolved
 
05:29:31.990 --> 05:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
pretty easily without me just by saying
 
05:29:34.030 --> 05:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
that you might come talk to me because
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
the 5-day business day response period
 
05:29:39.470 --> 05:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
for doing one of the three things that's
 
05:29:43.628 --> 05:29:43.638 align:start position:0%
an absolute and uh those cases I don't
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
see anything those are just inquiries
 
05:29:49.070 --> 05:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
you mean no no those could be cases and
 
05:29:52.590 --> 05:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
say look uh someone is it's been over
 
05:29:55.590 --> 05:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
five days and I've gotten
 
05:29:58.548 --> 05:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
nothing well that case is probably not
 
05:30:00.270 --> 05:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
one of my difficult
 
05:30:06.510 --> 05:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
cases okay um so my last question is um
 
05:30:09.190 --> 05:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
C Can you estimate how many of the cases
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
the 78 cases you've had would have gone
 
05:30:15.070 --> 05:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
to court had you not been here I don't
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
know yeah I I really don't know I mean I
 
05:30:23.350 --> 05:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:27.150 --> 05:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
are I'm not sure if somebody would say
 
05:30:29.670 --> 05:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
look it's been a month and I haven't
 
05:30:31.830 --> 05:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
heard anything I'm going to spend the
 
05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
amount of cost to go to court whereas
 
05:30:36.708 --> 05:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
they might say that they'll spend the
 
05:30:39.628 --> 05:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
$25 in order me but I couldn't really
 
05:30:42.548 --> 05:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
make that estimation I got you all right
 
05:30:44.270 --> 05:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:30:47.110 --> 05:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
MZ thank you Mr chair thank you for uh
 
05:30:51.150 --> 05:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
for coming in um after you've made a
 
05:30:54.070 --> 05:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
ruling what what do you what do you have
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the way of enforcement
 
05:31:00.788 --> 05:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
mechanisms well my ruling to be appeal
 
05:31:05.868 --> 05:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:10.030 --> 05:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
um I have the law that says you're
 
05:31:13.030 --> 05:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to listen to me and if you I
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
don't have a sheriff's apartment I don't
 
05:31:17.910 --> 05:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
have you know I don't have contemp
 
05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
Powers I do have a power that says I can
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
make a negative inference if someone
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
fails to abide by things that I
 
05:31:29.510 --> 05:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
order but that's a negative inference on
 
05:31:34.110 --> 05:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
paper so uh ultimately I I have found
 
05:31:36.190 --> 05:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
that sometimes people say I want you to
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
order a witness to come in
 
05:31:40.910 --> 05:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
my statute doesn't say that I like a
 
05:31:43.390 --> 05:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
court that I have jurisdiction over that
 
05:31:45.070 --> 05:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
person I don't have penina power to go
 
05:31:46.548 --> 05:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
tell somebody from the outside to come
 
05:31:47.948 --> 05:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
in and sit in my office and I'm going to
 
05:31:51.430 --> 05:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
go get you if you don't um
 
05:31:53.310 --> 05:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
so I've
 
05:31:58.350 --> 05:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:02.310 --> 05:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
personality um have have you have in in
 
05:32:05.310 --> 05:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
your two years doing this job have you
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
taken anyone to court for I I don't no I
 
05:32:12.830 --> 05:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
I issue my ruling I don't know how many
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
of my cases have been appealed I'm not
 
05:32:25.390 --> 05:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:28.628 --> 05:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
know I I don't I don't have a question I
 
05:32:30.030 --> 05:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say I looked at the
 
05:32:30.040 --> 05:32:30.990 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say I looked at the
calendar

05:32:30.990 --> 05:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
05:32:34.190 --> 05:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
hb11 is on the regular calendar for
 
05:32:38.110 --> 05:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and it's recommended otpa by a
 
05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:47.230 --> 05:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
margin anything else I can answer to you
 
05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:55.230 --> 05:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
happy um and I don't know if this Falls
 
05:32:57.030 --> 05:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
within your purview or not but I mean
 
05:32:59.750 --> 05:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that I've heard
 
05:33:02.070 --> 05:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of uh
 
05:33:04.510 --> 05:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
from our particularly our local school
 
05:33:07.868 --> 05:33:07.878 align:start position:0%
boards is the voluminous amounts of uh
 
05:33:09.390 --> 05:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
request for information that they're
 
05:33:11.270 --> 05:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
getting um do you have you gotten
 
05:33:13.830 --> 05:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
involved in that at all I mean in terms
 
05:33:19.830 --> 05:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
of uh any cases um and and I'm I'm I
 
05:33:21.430 --> 05:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
would imagine that some that somebody
 
05:33:24.110 --> 05:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
who's asking for the information might
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
come to you and say hey they're not
 
05:33:27.750 --> 05:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
giving it to to you but do you ever do
 
05:33:30.510 --> 05:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
you get the school board coming to you
 
05:33:33.868 --> 05:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
and saying this is unreasonable that's
 
05:33:35.430 --> 05:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
interesting the way my statute is
 
05:33:38.150 --> 05:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
written a complaint can be filed by a
 
05:33:41.628 --> 05:33:41.638 align:start position:0%
party AG grieved by a violation of 91a
 
05:33:45.150 --> 05:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
that means that the governmental unit
 
05:33:48.510 --> 05:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
can't bring a case to me can't the only
 
05:33:51.270 --> 05:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
one that can is a person that's grieved
 
05:33:54.830 --> 05:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
by a violation of 91a and those are the
 
05:33:57.510 --> 05:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
those are that's the governmental unit
 
05:33:59.830 --> 05:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
so I've never had a case any any
 
05:34:01.470 --> 05:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
governmental unit attempt to bring a
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
case to me I assume because they've read
 
05:34:05.190 --> 05:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
the statute and they say it looks like
 
05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
claimants can bring them but I can't now
 
05:34:09.510 --> 05:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the course of a case of course the
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
governmental unit could say look this is
 
05:34:16.670 --> 05:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
just unjust vexatious and I want uh
 
05:34:19.230 --> 05:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
sanctions against that person I've had
 
05:34:24.430 --> 05:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:26.670 --> 05:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
occasions representative
 
05:34:29.910 --> 05:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
Le thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
05:34:32.230 --> 05:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
appearing today so I was just going
 
05:34:34.110 --> 05:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
through your report which is I found
 
05:34:36.628 --> 05:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting that um most of the
 
05:34:38.990 --> 05:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
claimants that says here prosay without
 
05:34:40.590 --> 05:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
another representative and then below
 
05:34:43.310 --> 05:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
that I guess seven claimants appeared
 
05:34:45.750 --> 05:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
through an attorney so these are people
 
05:34:47.548 --> 05:34:47.558 align:start position:0%
primarily just coming in because they've
 
05:34:49.470 --> 05:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
got a complaint generally against the
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
municipality is a rule or one of the
 
05:34:55.270 --> 05:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
difficulties I have is a lot of uh right
 
05:34:56.750 --> 05:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
to no requests
 
05:34:59.470 --> 05:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
don't they stem from something else
 
05:35:01.070 --> 05:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's some kind of dispute
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
underlying dispute and the claimant
 
05:35:05.548 --> 05:35:05.558 align:start position:0%
might come in and say well I want this
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
because I have to explain that I can't
 
05:35:09.708 --> 05:35:09.718 align:start position:0%
resolve the underlying dispute only the
 
05:35:12.070 --> 05:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
91a aspect of it I'm not sure if that
 
05:35:14.510 --> 05:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
gets to your question but no it's a good
 
05:35:16.070 --> 05:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
report though there's a lot to it so
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
you've obviously done a little work look
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
a little busier than maybe some of the
 
05:35:23.190 --> 05:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:26.510 --> 05:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
yourself a lot I'm easy to
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
find so back to this question of of
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
voluminous requests so we've heard that
 
05:35:38.670 --> 05:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
um sometimes people
 
05:35:41.548 --> 05:35:41.558 align:start position:0%
there's no exception in 91a for the
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
volume of stuff right but but the the uh
 
05:35:49.750 --> 05:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
agency is able to charge the cost of
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
producing whatever it is is just the
 
05:35:55.070 --> 05:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
cost the actual cost the actual copying
 
05:35:56.910 --> 05:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
costs not the
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
labor I see not looking it up or
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
whatever is that what you mean it's just
 
05:36:05.230 --> 05:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
the cost so you might find uh you might
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
find charges of 25 cents 10 cents a
 
05:36:11.470 --> 05:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
dollar but it has to be cost based
 
05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
without the labor okay so even if it's
 
05:36:16.590 --> 05:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
to produce 5,000 Pages or something like
 
05:36:17.830 --> 05:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
that right I mean there's been some
 
05:36:21.430 --> 05:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
adjustments recently to 91a that that
 
05:36:24.548 --> 05:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
address that uh about particularly about
 
05:36:27.070 --> 05:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
emails and what what you can charge for
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
that that's a recent Amendment 91 I hav
 
05:36:30.788 --> 05:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
had had an opportunity to have a case on
 
05:36:34.270 --> 05:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
anything like that yet uh and you know
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
91a gets changed a lot and when people
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
people often say that's what that's
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
going what's that going to do to your
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
office I have no control over that I
 
05:36:44.070 --> 05:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's what it does to people on the
 
05:36:45.750 --> 05:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
outside and if there's a dispute that's
 
05:36:47.868 --> 05:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
based on the amendment so I don't know
 
05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
change 91a and see what happens and as
 
05:36:53.350 --> 05:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
an unclassified employee you have a
 
05:36:56.990 --> 05:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
contract right or not no it's a I'm an
 
05:36:59.110 --> 05:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
unclassified employee which is I'm a
 
05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
labor grade GG on uh the unclassified
 
05:37:05.990 --> 05:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
system uh it's I see so you're basically
 
05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
salary you're at will so if it ends no
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not at will I'm uh appointed to a
 
05:37:13.070 --> 05:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
term which expires on July 1st 2025
 
05:37:14.670 --> 05:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
unless I get reappointed which I might
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
or might not we don't know and I may or
 
05:37:18.990 --> 05:37:19.000 align:start position:0%

gotcha all right thank you
representative

05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
um I if you if you don't mind just humor
 
05:37:33.470 --> 05:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
me with this you know this line of uh
 
05:37:37.230 --> 05:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
thought that I was going on um is are
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
there are there are there situations in
 
05:37:44.830 --> 05:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
other states where the the role that an
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
equivalent to you would be playing where
 
05:37:49.788 --> 05:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
they would be looking at you know kind
 
05:37:52.750 --> 05:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
of what I would call Bo both sides of
 
05:37:56.310 --> 05:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
the information request I mean what what
 
05:37:58.270 --> 05:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
I heard you say is that basically it's
 
05:38:01.548 --> 05:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
one-sided it's it's it's the the the
 
05:38:03.670 --> 05:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
individual wants information from the
 
05:38:04.990 --> 05:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
government the government's not getting
 
05:38:06.628 --> 05:38:06.638 align:start position:0%
it they have the right to appeal but if
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
they go to the government and that the
 
05:38:10.190 --> 05:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
government thinks it's excessive the
 
05:38:12.230 --> 05:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
government has no right to appe well
 
05:38:15.390 --> 05:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
they can in they can say in their case
 
05:38:17.830 --> 05:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
that my defense to what you have brought
 
05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
is that this is unreasonable unjust
 
05:38:23.230 --> 05:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
vexatious they can make that as a
 
05:38:25.030 --> 05:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
defense but but they can't they can't
 
05:38:27.830 --> 05:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
bring a case are there other states
 
05:38:30.830 --> 05:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
where that is permitted is or is that
 
05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
just not the way law certain if there
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
are other states that do that when I
 
05:38:36.990 --> 05:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
when I first started one of the things I
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
did is I looked around to other people
 
05:38:39.670 --> 05:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
who had a position like this and the
 
05:38:42.390 --> 05:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
first thing that I found out is that
 
05:38:43.548 --> 05:38:43.558 align:start position:0%
well there's a couple of different ways
 
05:38:45.750 --> 05:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
of doing things there's the kind of the
 
05:38:47.910 --> 05:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
model that we have which is called an
 
05:38:49.788 --> 05:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
ombudsman but actually he a quasi
 
05:38:52.070 --> 05:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
judicial official and then there's other
 
05:38:53.708 --> 05:38:53.718 align:start position:0%
states that have an ombudsman which is
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
somebody that actually goes out and
 
05:38:59.030 --> 05:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
tries is more of an advocate but not
 
05:39:01.390 --> 05:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
really an advocate they try to assist
 
05:39:04.110 --> 05:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
the side they're they're they provide
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
more guidance to the people I have to
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
kind of remove myself from it and just
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
look at it neutrally and say okay that
 
05:39:13.190 --> 05:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
or that and I think I talked to Maine
 
05:39:15.190 --> 05:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that Maine's the one that
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
point it out to me that this is more
 
05:39:19.750 --> 05:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial than a lot of states and
 
05:39:21.150 --> 05:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's confusing because the
 
05:39:23.788 --> 05:39:23.798 align:start position:0%
title of the job and I can understand
 
05:39:25.830 --> 05:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
how someone would be confused by the
 
05:39:27.990 --> 05:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
title of the job and also when you look
 
05:39:30.270 --> 05:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
at the definitions of what I do what I
 
05:39:34.548 --> 05:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
do I'm not like one of my first one of
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
my frequent first inquiries was was
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
whether I was the DHHS utsman in order
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
to resolve their disputes with you know
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
people involved in medical things I'm
 
05:39:50.750 --> 05:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
not that's on my voicemail
 
05:39:53.910 --> 05:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
now I have to say a lot there because in
 
05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
my when people call because I've got a
 
05:39:58.468 --> 05:39:58.478 align:start position:0%
lot of ethical constraints I can't
 
05:40:00.990 --> 05:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
really have a one-sided contact with one
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
party I have to remove myself a bit
 
05:40:06.390 --> 05:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
which is hard to do when you're the guy
 
05:40:08.910 --> 05:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
that also has to be responsive to
 
05:40:11.350 --> 05:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
inquiries like the guy that has to be
 
05:40:13.948 --> 05:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
probably more responsive than
 
05:40:16.750 --> 05:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
most so do you have any sort of evidence
 
05:40:20.110 --> 05:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
that the creation of your office has
 
05:40:23.590 --> 05:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
improved compliance with 91a I don't
 
05:40:23.600 --> 05:40:27.350 align:start position:0%
improved compliance with 91a I don't
know

05:40:27.350 --> 05:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.548 --> 05:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I'm trying to think of what
 
05:40:34.350 --> 05:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:37.590 --> 05:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
that well I guess the metric I would use
 
05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
is that um I've driven myself out of
 
05:40:42.510 --> 05:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
business and I haven't done that yet
 
05:40:45.948 --> 05:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
okay how about number of 91a cases filed
 
05:40:49.708 --> 05:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
in court yeah I'm I know the court has
 
05:40:52.030 --> 05:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
that information but I don't have it
 
05:40:54.350 --> 05:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay Melissa we can ask for that yeah
 
05:40:56.190 --> 05:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you all right other
 
05:40:58.190 --> 05:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee all right i' I'm Ren dry so
 
05:41:05.628 --> 05:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
care we have about five minutes and then
 
05:41:09.280 --> 05:41:12.350 align:start position:0%
care we have about five minutes and then
we

05:41:12.350 --> 05:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:15.590 --> 05:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
have no not and then we have uh Public
 
05:41:21.430 --> 05:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:39.670 --> 05:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:06.120 --> 05:42:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:36.120 --> 05:43:06.110 align:start position:0%

experience in litigation because uh when
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
the board has to hear contested cases
 
05:47:56.190 --> 05:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
that knowledge and skill set um becomes
 
05:47:56.200 --> 05:47:57.030 align:start position:0%
that knowledge and skill set um becomes
very

05:47:57.030 --> 05:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:47:59.230 --> 05:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
important uh in addition to the board
 
05:48:02.910 --> 05:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
members there are four uh authorized
 
05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
classified employee positions three of
 
05:48:07.830 --> 05:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
those are filled current
 
05:48:10.430 --> 05:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
one is vacant uh I'm in one of those
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
positions I also have a hearing officer
 
05:48:16.270 --> 05:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
staff attorney and then I have one uh
 
05:48:18.590 --> 05:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
support staff
 
05:48:22.670 --> 05:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
person um in terms of activity level and
 
05:48:25.548 --> 05:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
some of this is covered in the handout
 
05:48:28.230 --> 05:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh we have averaged about 106 case
 
05:48:30.628 --> 05:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
filings over the past five
 
05:48:35.190 --> 05:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
years and those are in uh categories
 
05:48:38.788 --> 05:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
um such as bargaining unit petitions
 
05:48:41.990 --> 05:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
challenge election petitions uh
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%

practice complaints declaratory
 
05:48:49.350 --> 05:48:49.360 align:start position:0%

05:48:51.548 --> 05:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
appointments of grievance arbitrators
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
and petitions for the appointment of
 
05:48:56.190 --> 05:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining impass mediators and
 
05:48:59.830 --> 05:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
bargaining impass uh fact finders we've
 
05:49:03.468 --> 05:49:03.478 align:start position:0%
a averaged about 270 decisions in orders
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
over the past five fiscal years all of
 
05:49:10.150 --> 05:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
these are posted on the board's website
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh as well as all orders dating back to
 
05:49:12.878 --> 05:49:14.948 align:start position:0%
uh as well as all orders dating back to
uh

05:49:14.948 --> 05:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:49:17.990 --> 05:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
1976 we conduct uh as part of our
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
operations we conduct prehearing
 
05:49:21.670 --> 05:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
conferences status conferences
 
05:49:24.590 --> 05:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
pre-election conferences uh as well as
 
05:49:26.468 --> 05:49:26.478 align:start position:0%
the hearings themselves the hearings are
 
05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearings we
 
05:49:31.910 --> 05:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
function uh like a trial court with a
 
05:49:34.190 --> 05:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
very specialized area of jurisdiction
 
05:49:35.910 --> 05:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
and so the normal protocols that you
 
05:49:37.350 --> 05:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
would find
 
05:49:39.030 --> 05:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh in a regular Court setting are the
 
05:49:41.670 --> 05:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
same ones that we follow in other words
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh Witnesses are called to present
 
05:49:46.750 --> 05:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
testimony their the questions posed to
 
05:49:48.548 --> 05:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
Witnesses are subject to objections
 
05:49:50.830 --> 05:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
which the board has to resolve and then
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
the board also receives evidence in the
 
05:49:56.150 --> 05:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
form of exhibits uh typically after the
 
05:49:58.270 --> 05:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
close of every hearing there is a period
 
05:50:00.510 --> 05:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
of time requested by the parties to file
 
05:50:03.190 --> 05:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
post hearing briefs which is their final
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity sum to summarize and argue
 
05:50:07.708 --> 05:50:07.718 align:start position:0%
their case to the board after that's
 
05:50:10.390 --> 05:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
done uh a decisional issue either by a
 
05:50:12.190 --> 05:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
hearing officer if the case Was Heard by
 
05:50:15.190 --> 05:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
a hearing officer or a decisional issue
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
by the board if it's a board decision I
 
05:50:19.110 --> 05:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
sit with the board uh they tell me what
 
05:50:20.590 --> 05:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
their decision is and I write the
 
05:50:23.670 --> 05:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
decision the hearing officer writes uh
 
05:50:25.310 --> 05:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
and I do sometimes sit as a hearing
 
05:50:26.670 --> 05:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
officer but the hearing officer writes
 
05:50:29.628 --> 05:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
their own decision all such decisions
 
05:50:31.868 --> 05:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
whether by the hearing officer or or the
 
05:50:33.868 --> 05:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
board are subject to an internal review
 
05:50:35.910 --> 05:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
process if it's a hearing officer
 
05:50:38.430 --> 05:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
decision there's two levels of review uh
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
a motion for re a review motion for
 
05:50:43.628 --> 05:50:43.638 align:start position:0%
review which the board looks at and then
 
05:50:45.948 --> 05:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
the board's decision on that motion is
 
05:50:48.468 --> 05:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
subject to a motion for rehearing the
 
05:50:50.990 --> 05:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
board's decision if they hear the case
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the first instance is subject to a
 
05:50:56.350 --> 05:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
motion for rehearing uh and all of these
 
05:50:58.270 --> 05:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
motions are the opportunity for the
 
05:51:01.030 --> 05:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
board to review the decision to consider
 
05:51:04.150 --> 05:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
arguments about uh the possibility that
 
05:51:06.788 --> 05:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
there are errors in the written decision
 
05:51:08.830 --> 05:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
and to address and correct those
 
05:51:12.070 --> 05:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
including scheduling further proceedings
 
05:51:14.830 --> 05:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
after that process is complete and the
 
05:51:17.548 --> 05:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
decision becomes final uh the decisions
 
05:51:20.468 --> 05:51:20.478 align:start position:0%
are subject to uh a rule 10 appeal to
 
05:51:22.830 --> 05:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court those are
 
05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
discretionary appeals but I think since
 
05:51:29.990 --> 05:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
2010 uh the court has accepted uh almost
 
05:51:32.230 --> 05:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
every single appeal that's been
 
05:51:37.070 --> 05:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
filed uh and in terms of
 
05:51:41.868 --> 05:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
uh other activity at the board uh
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
the the reason for the board's existence
 
05:51:47.230 --> 05:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
is so that uh employees can organize
 
05:51:50.030 --> 05:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
form bargaining units and negotiate
 
05:51:53.030 --> 05:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
contracts and uh the parties when they
 
05:51:54.910 --> 05:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
settle a contract are required to file
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
those with the board uh we maintain an
 
05:51:59.230 --> 05:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
inventory of those contracts they're
 
05:52:01.430 --> 05:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
published on our website along with the
 
05:52:03.670 --> 05:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
list of all bargaining unit
 
05:52:05.750 --> 05:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
certifications and I have included a
 
05:52:09.430 --> 05:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
table on page four of the handout uh
 
05:52:11.990 --> 05:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
with some detail on bargaining units and
 
05:52:14.110 --> 05:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
current contracts but the the major
 
05:52:17.670 --> 05:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
takeaway from that is that 93% of the
 
05:52:20.030 --> 05:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
contracts that we have on file are
 
05:52:23.468 --> 05:52:23.478 align:start position:0%
current and by that I mean the contracts
 
05:52:25.150 --> 05:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
have not yet reached their stated
 
05:52:29.670 --> 05:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
expiration date the 42 that have expired
 
05:52:32.430 --> 05:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
mostly cons consist of contracts that
 
05:52:35.830 --> 05:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
expired in 2004 a fair number of those
 
05:52:39.670 --> 05:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
expired December 31 uh another popular
 
05:52:41.868 --> 05:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
date uh and this is in the education
 
05:52:44.310 --> 05:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
setting is June
 
05:52:47.510 --> 05:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
30th sometimes there's a lag uh in when
 
05:52:50.190 --> 05:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
successor contracts are negotiated and
 
05:52:51.868 --> 05:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
approved and when they get filed with
 
05:52:54.310 --> 05:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
the board so I anticipate over the next
 
05:52:57.030 --> 05:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
six months we we will receive a fair
 
05:53:00.110 --> 05:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
number of current successor contracts
 
05:53:02.910 --> 05:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
for the 42 expired ones uh in our
 
05:53:06.548 --> 05:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
current inventory historically uh during
 
05:53:09.750 --> 05:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
my tenure with the board a 93% current
 
05:53:14.910 --> 05:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
approval uh level is very high uh so the
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
system seems to be
 
05:53:19.548 --> 05:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
working uh I think on the say again what
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
do you mean by 93% approv so of the
 
05:53:24.708 --> 05:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
contracts listed in that
 
05:53:28.270 --> 05:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
table 93% of them are current they
 
05:53:31.670 --> 05:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
haven't reached their stated expiration
 
05:53:31.680 --> 05:53:33.670 align:start position:0%
haven't reached their stated expiration
date

05:53:33.670 --> 05:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
date
 
05:53:37.548 --> 05:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
42 42 of the contracts uh exp have
 
05:53:40.230 --> 05:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
reached their expiration date uh most of
 
05:53:43.830 --> 05:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
those expired in 2024 so for example a
 
05:53:46.150 --> 05:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
contract Oh you mean so certain number
 
05:53:47.708 --> 05:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
of people are operating without a
 
05:53:50.390 --> 05:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
contract well they operate under the
 
05:53:52.868 --> 05:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
status quo Doctrine yeah they continue
 
05:53:54.750 --> 05:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
to operate under the terms established
 
05:53:57.750 --> 05:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
under the contracts so and and I'm
 
05:53:59.468 --> 05:53:59.478 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there actually may be
 
05:54:02.310 --> 05:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
successor contracts in place that have
 
05:54:04.708 --> 05:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
not come into yet come into our
 
05:54:06.868 --> 05:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
office uh what did mean by a
 
05:54:09.830 --> 05:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
pre-election hearing so uh one category
 
05:54:11.670 --> 05:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
of cases that we do has to do with
 
05:54:14.150 --> 05:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
either new bargaining unit formation or
 
05:54:16.750 --> 05:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
unions challenging another Union to
 
05:54:19.468 --> 05:54:19.478 align:start position:0%
represent the bargaining unit and in
 
05:54:21.868 --> 05:54:21.878 align:start position:0%
there are preliminary proceedings to
 
05:54:23.948 --> 05:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
First determine a bargaining unit if
 
05:54:26.590 --> 05:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
necessary sometimes they're agreed upon
 
05:54:28.628 --> 05:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh and if a case is approved for
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
election because we have to hold an
 
05:54:33.548 --> 05:54:33.558 align:start position:0%
election to determine who if anybody is
 
05:54:35.110 --> 05:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
going to represent the bargaining unit
 
05:54:37.750 --> 05:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
we use the pre-election conference which
 
05:54:40.910 --> 05:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
is a a meeting involving the union and
 
05:54:43.990 --> 05:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
the public employer and my staff to
 
05:54:46.150 --> 05:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
decide when the election's going to be
 
05:54:48.270 --> 05:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
where it's going to be uh how long the
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
polling is going to be whether it's
 
05:54:52.548 --> 05:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
going to be on site or mail ballot okay
 
05:54:55.390 --> 05:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in
 
05:55:03.070 --> 05:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
um uh what is the what is the the the
 
05:55:06.310 --> 05:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
the overlap or or boundaries of respons
 
05:55:08.948 --> 05:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
responsibilities between you and the NL
 
05:55:11.868 --> 05:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
nlrb there is there is no overlap the
 
05:55:13.350 --> 05:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
National Labor Relations Board is
 
05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for collective bargaining
 
05:55:16.708 --> 05:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
for private sector
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
employees public sector collective
 
05:55:22.030 --> 05:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
bargaining is determined by the
 
05:55:22.040 --> 05:55:23.788 align:start position:0%
bargaining is determined by the
states

05:55:23.788 --> 05:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:55:26.548 --> 05:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
so but it's a similar function I guess
 
05:55:30.390 --> 05:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
is that it's similar but I the
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and the way the National
 
05:55:35.110 --> 05:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
Labor Rel Relations Board operates is
 
05:55:37.030 --> 05:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
very different than the way most of at
 
05:55:39.750 --> 05:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
least most of this the boards like ours
 
05:55:42.030 --> 05:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
in New England function gotcha
 
05:55:45.190 --> 05:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative R thank you Mr chair and
 
05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I'm
 
05:55:49.350 --> 05:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
assuming under Municipal as far as the
 
05:55:52.590 --> 05:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
employer type that that includes school
 
05:55:54.948 --> 05:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
districts yeah
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
so right and that's also true for the
 
05:55:59.990 --> 05:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
cities so it's the it's it would include
 
05:56:01.628 --> 05:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
school districts it includes law
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement includes firefighter
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
bargaining units um there are actually
 
05:56:08.070 --> 05:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh about
 
05:56:12.430 --> 05:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
305 education contracts on file with us
 
05:56:14.830 --> 05:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
some of those cover teachers some of
 
05:56:16.868 --> 05:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
them cover par professionals some of
 
05:56:19.708 --> 05:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
them cover administrative staff some of
 
05:56:22.628 --> 05:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
them cover people who work in custodial
 
05:56:25.190 --> 05:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
type positions but I those are not
 
05:56:26.788 --> 05:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
broken out in this
 
05:56:29.150 --> 05:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
table I'm not seeing any money in this
 
05:56:32.270 --> 05:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
page for the board are they paid or not
 
05:56:33.990 --> 05:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
well there is that's one of the things I
 
05:56:36.670 --> 05:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to get to but the board received
 
05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh per DM and if you turn to the last
 
05:56:42.110 --> 05:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
page I included a couple of notes and
 
05:56:46.350 --> 05:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
note five um addresses this topic when
 
05:56:48.830 --> 05:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
the statute and the board was created in
 
05:56:53.468 --> 05:56:53.478 align:start position:0%
1975 the per DM per day was $25 it was
 
05:56:54.670 --> 05:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
increased to
 
05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
$50 uh in the mid1 1980s I believe in
 
05:57:01.750 --> 05:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
1985 has it hasn't changed since then so
 
05:57:04.548 --> 05:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
for 40 years the PDM has been
 
05:57:08.270 --> 05:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
$50 uh this year I have included uh a
 
05:57:11.868 --> 05:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
request to increase that perdum to
 
05:57:14.270 --> 05:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
$250 which I think I believe is
 
05:57:17.830 --> 05:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with the change from 1975 to
 
05:57:21.468 --> 05:57:21.478 align:start position:0%
1985 as well as other economic
 
05:57:24.868 --> 05:57:24.878 align:start position:0%
considerations uh so for the class 50
 
05:57:29.270 --> 05:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
expense uh if if I was working up a line
 
05:57:31.590 --> 05:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
based on a $50 per DM I would have put
 
05:57:34.270 --> 05:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
2,000 in that line I put
 
05:57:37.708 --> 05:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
10,000 uh and I have also requested an
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to the applicable statute
 
05:57:43.910 --> 05:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is referenced in form E I believe
 
05:57:47.230 --> 05:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
so on the governor's budget request they
 
05:57:49.548 --> 05:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
left they included the
 
05:57:52.350 --> 05:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh but if my understanding of
 
05:57:55.868 --> 05:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill is correct uh that's
 
05:57:58.750 --> 05:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
where the governor would include any
 
05:58:02.430 --> 05:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
necessary statutory amendments uh to
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
implement no we have the 10,000 in our
 
05:58:06.788 --> 05:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
05:58:09.190 --> 05:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
it it's it's in the it's in the budget
 
05:58:10.990 --> 05:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
request correct no but it's in the
 
05:58:15.990 --> 05:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
budget House Bill one okay it but
 
05:58:19.948 --> 05:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
there it's a statutory it's a statutory
 
05:58:24.590 --> 05:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
fee oh I see yeah 273 A2 Roman numeral 7
 
05:58:26.990 --> 05:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be amended to change the number
 
05:58:31.910 --> 05:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
from 50 to 250 I and that's not in House
 
05:58:34.628 --> 05:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 yet is that what you're saying
 
05:58:36.430 --> 05:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
it's not reflected in the Governor's
 
05:58:39.310 --> 05:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill based on my reading of that
 
05:58:42.468 --> 05:58:42.478 align:start position:0%
okay so so Melissa you or Jack you make
 
05:58:45.430 --> 05:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
sure that yes and I know I submitted
 
05:58:45.440 --> 05:58:46.510 align:start position:0%
sure that yes and I know I submitted
several

05:58:46.510 --> 05:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
several
 
05:58:49.590 --> 05:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
forms in the fall and early
 
05:58:52.270 --> 05:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
winter on this topic I believe to the
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate people so I don't know if it
 
05:58:57.030 --> 05:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
was a conscious decision or oversight
 
05:58:58.750 --> 05:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
yeah Melissa if you do have that
 
05:59:00.310 --> 05:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
language if you could send that to me
 
05:59:02.350 --> 05:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
that would be great representative
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
Grille yes so I was wondering how many
 
05:59:08.750 --> 05:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
times a year does board meet so the the
 
05:59:10.628 --> 05:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
the board physically will come into the
 
05:59:12.868 --> 05:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
office uh to hear an unfair Labor
 
05:59:14.990 --> 05:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
practice charge uh all the other cases
 
05:59:17.628 --> 05:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
are normally heard by a hearing officer
 
05:59:21.430 --> 05:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh my goal if I'm doing my job correctly
 
05:59:23.468 --> 05:59:23.478 align:start position:0%
is to prevent that from happening as
 
05:59:25.510 --> 05:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
much as possible so some years they're
 
05:59:27.990 --> 05:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the office more than others but
 
05:59:31.390 --> 05:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
usually 10 uh cases or less a year but
 
05:59:36.390 --> 05:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
they also uh deliberate on uh
 
05:59:38.230 --> 05:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
motions for review of hearing officer
 
05:59:40.190 --> 05:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
decisions on a fairly regular basis they
 
05:59:42.030 --> 05:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
don't come into the office to do that we
 
05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
do that uh using a video conferencing
 
05:59:47.708 --> 05:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
feature but that would count as a
 
05:59:49.350 --> 05:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
working on a case like that would count
 
05:59:52.070 --> 05:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
as a day uh but you have to keep in mind
 
05:59:53.628 --> 05:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
when they get a case like that they're
 
05:59:55.548 --> 05:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
getting the entire record of the
 
05:59:57.030 --> 05:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings all the
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
pleadings uh all the exhibits as well as
 
06:00:01.868 --> 06:00:01.878 align:start position:0%
the decision and then the motion for
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
review and the objection so they have to
 
06:00:07.948 --> 06:00:07.958 align:start position:0%
spend time before they deliberate to to
 
06:00:09.788 --> 06:00:09.798 align:start position:0%
uh understand what the issues are so
 
06:00:11.788 --> 06:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
they can make an informed decision
 
06:00:13.788 --> 06:00:13.798 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm not able to police that
 
06:00:16.230 --> 06:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
but uh I always staff those
 
06:00:18.150 --> 06:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
deliberations and I'm always very
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
impressed by the U attentiveness that
 
06:00:23.750 --> 06:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
the board pays to these kinds of of
 
06:00:26.190 --> 06:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
motions they take their uh duties very
 
06:00:30.708 --> 06:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
seriously if it's $250 a day that's only
 
06:00:33.150 --> 06:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
40 Man days for
 
06:00:36.110 --> 06:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
$110,000 right so and you need three at
 
06:00:38.030 --> 06:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
a time right I think we're distinguished
 
06:00:39.510 --> 06:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
from some of the other boards for
 
06:00:40.948 --> 06:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
example the board of tax and land
 
06:00:42.590 --> 06:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
appeals I think has full-time board
 
06:00:47.310 --> 06:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
members in our case uh the primary
 
06:00:50.030 --> 06:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility for making sure that the
 
06:00:52.270 --> 06:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
operations of the plrb are running
 
06:00:56.708 --> 06:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
correctly and smoothly is falls on me
 
06:01:00.590 --> 06:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh okay I see another hand yes
 
06:01:03.110 --> 06:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
representating people I just thank you
 
06:01:04.750 --> 06:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
for coming I just wondered if you had
 
06:01:07.070 --> 06:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
trouble getting people to to serve on
 
06:01:10.910 --> 06:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
the board no uh we currently have uh
 
06:01:15.310 --> 06:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
only two vacant positions uh we have two
 
06:01:18.788 --> 06:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
chairs two management and three labor
 
06:01:21.670 --> 06:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
right now so I haven't been actively
 
06:01:24.430 --> 06:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
recruiting not that I recruit but my my
 
06:01:27.750 --> 06:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
normal strategy and I did go through
 
06:01:30.670 --> 06:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
this 10 12 years ago is to talk to the
 
06:01:32.390 --> 06:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
other board members and who do you know
 
06:01:35.430 --> 06:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
who do you know uh and Chuck Temple had
 
06:01:39.628 --> 06:01:39.638 align:start position:0%
come on board in 2010 or 11 and he had
 
06:01:41.670 --> 06:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
made some suggestions of people he had
 
06:01:44.350 --> 06:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
come on as a chair and made some
 
06:01:46.590 --> 06:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
suggestions for some other board members
 
06:01:48.190 --> 06:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
and we were able to get a couple other
 
06:01:51.708 --> 06:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
chairs to come on um and then Chuck
 
06:01:54.350 --> 06:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
subsequently went on to the superior
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
court and one of the individuals he
 
06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
suggested David Burns came on and then
 
06:02:02.468 --> 06:02:02.478 align:start position:0%
he left to and he was put on on the
 
06:02:05.468 --> 06:02:05.478 align:start position:0%
court but since then uh there our chairs
 
06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
have been pretty stable availability is
 
06:02:10.350 --> 06:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
a big issue uh that's why we have
 
06:02:12.510 --> 06:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
multiple board members but if we give
 
06:02:16.030 --> 06:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
them enough advanced notice uh they're
 
06:02:17.430 --> 06:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
usually because they're most most of
 
06:02:19.070 --> 06:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
them are working they're usually able to
 
06:02:21.310 --> 06:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
find Space on their calendar but they
 
06:02:23.110 --> 06:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
are are never happy if there's a last
 
06:02:25.270 --> 06:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
minute settlement when they're blocked
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
out time are they appointed by the
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
governor yes Governor nominates
 
06:02:31.788 --> 06:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
executive Council
 
06:02:31.798 --> 06:02:34.110 align:start position:0%
executive Council
confirms

06:02:34.110 --> 06:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
confirms
 
06:02:37.230 --> 06:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
and I I assume these are there's no fees
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
for these cases there's a uh $60 fee
 
06:02:42.510 --> 06:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
associated with the unfair Labor
 
06:02:44.830 --> 06:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
practice complaint and that's it oh okay
 
06:02:48.990 --> 06:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
I think the idea is we want to encourage
 
06:02:51.150 --> 06:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
both sides to use the board as a
 
06:02:53.110 --> 06:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
resource and not create any kind of
 
06:02:53.120 --> 06:02:55.788 align:start position:0%
resource and not create any kind of
financial

06:02:55.788 --> 06:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:58.350 --> 06:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
obstacle and has that been in a place
 
06:03:00.990 --> 06:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
for 50 years since the since the
 
06:03:01.000 --> 06:03:02.788 align:start position:0%
for 50 years since the since the
beginning

06:03:02.788 --> 06:03:02.798 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
06:03:07.910 --> 06:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um but the other cases are
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
just as significant right or even more
 
06:03:12.468 --> 06:03:12.478 align:start position:0%
so yes right yeah they have to do more
 
06:03:14.548 --> 06:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
with the administration and management
 
06:03:16.190 --> 06:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
of a bargaining unit once it's up and
 
06:03:18.230 --> 06:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
running but there are no filing fees
 
06:03:21.110 --> 06:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
associated with that so I don't know why
 
06:03:23.468 --> 06:03:23.478 align:start position:0%
the unfair Labor practice was singled
 
06:03:28.990 --> 06:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
out for a filing fee maybe in 1975 $60
 
06:03:32.070 --> 06:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
was cost prohibitive and and protected
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
against uh frequent
 
06:03:37.150 --> 06:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
filing has the number of cases stayed
 
06:03:38.910 --> 06:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
pretty constant over the years it
 
06:03:41.750 --> 06:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
fluctuates but the numbers on average
 
06:03:45.670 --> 06:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
and I have tracked since at least
 
06:03:48.830 --> 06:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
2010 uh the numbers tend to stay pretty
 
06:03:50.830 --> 06:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
constant I mean you'll see years where
 
06:03:52.468 --> 06:03:52.478 align:start position:0%
you get quite a few unfair labor
 
06:03:55.468 --> 06:03:55.478 align:start position:0%
practices and you wonder what's going on
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh and then other times it'll things
 
06:03:59.430 --> 06:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
will quiet down but you'll see a surge
 
06:04:02.628 --> 06:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
in other types of cases got any other
 
06:04:05.310 --> 06:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
questions represent LE just quickly
 
06:04:07.788 --> 06:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
again the average number of cases a year
 
06:04:10.190 --> 06:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
that your board handles 106 are the
 
06:04:12.510 --> 06:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
filings over the last the average over
 
06:04:15.390 --> 06:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
the last five fiscal
 
06:04:19.270 --> 06:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
years of months I just Googled um
 
06:04:21.708 --> 06:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
inflation since
 
06:04:25.868 --> 06:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
1975 and a $60 fee in 1975 would be
 
06:04:25.878 --> 06:04:26.670 align:start position:0%
1975 and a $60 fee in 1975 would be
worth

06:04:26.670 --> 06:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
worth
 
06:04:26.680 --> 06:04:28.310 align:start position:0%
worth
$352

06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
$352
 
06:04:31.110 --> 06:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
today yeah that makes more sense I think
 
06:04:33.350 --> 06:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
but anyway all
 
06:04:36.430 --> 06:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
right so
 
06:04:38.030 --> 06:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
all right well it's it's something
 
06:04:40.468 --> 06:04:40.478 align:start position:0%
anyways all right um any other questions
 
06:04:42.510 --> 06:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
no all
 
06:04:46.430 --> 06:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
right no we'll wait on this one thank
 
06:04:49.070 --> 06:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you all right so
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
we're coming back Friday I believe at
 
06:04:57.468 --> 06:04:57.478 align:start position:0%
10: oh no one one right because there's
 
06:05:00.868 --> 06:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
