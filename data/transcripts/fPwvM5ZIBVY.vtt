on House Bill 15 relative to the rate of
 
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax and for the
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
record I have a conflict because I pay
 
00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
this tax but I will participate so with
 
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 align:start position:0%

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning Madam chair and
 
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
Janine nodder I represent the town of
 
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Hillsborough District 12.
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
as some of you know I come from the same
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
town as our late speaker dick hinch
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
he was a committed legislator who
 
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
excelled at bringing people together to
 
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
pass policies that would help the lives
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
of everyday New Hampshire citizens
 
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
I learned a lot from speaker hinch
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
when I was new to these Halls he
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
instilled in me that the most important
 
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
thing that you have as a legislator is
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
your word
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
if you make a promise it's up to you to
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
do everything that you can to keep it
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's why he was so committed to
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
keeping the promises of the business tax
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
relief that we made in the 2017 state
 
00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:57.230 align:start position:0%
relief that we made in the 2017 state
budget

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
if the timeline from that budget
 
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
remained intact the rates that are
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
included in House Bill 15 would already
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
be the law
 
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
along with our late speaker I felt that
 
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
we made a promise to New Hampshire's
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
business community in 2017. it's not too
 
00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
late to keep that promise
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 15 honors our word and gives
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
tax relief so that employers from the
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
local mom and pop corner store to Market
 
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
Basket can offer another teenager their
 
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
first job are companies like Fidelity in
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
my town can continue to bring more great
 
00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
jobs across New England to its Merrimack
 
00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
jobs across New England to its Merrimack
campus

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
campus
 
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
passing this bill sends a strong message
 
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
to businesses across the region and
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
across the country that New Hampshire is
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
the right place to bring and grow a
 
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.010 align:start position:0%
the right place to bring and grow a
company

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 align:start position:0%
most importantly though it is that this
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill would keep our word that we made in
 
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.610 align:start position:0%
bill would keep our word that we made in
2017.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
that was critically important to speaker
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
hinch and should be important to all of
 
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
us for these reasons I encourage the
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
committee to find this bill ought to
 
00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
would you be open to questions
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
well I'm late for my own committee so um
 
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
would you mind if I referred the
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
question to other people
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay I will recognize Mr Greg Moore from

I hope everybody enjoyed their snow day
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
here today for the record my name is
 
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
Craig Moore I am the state director with
 
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity here in New
 
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.409 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity here in New
Hampshire

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
and I've been in this role now 10 years
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
and for 10 years we've been having
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
discussions about business taxes and
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
business tax rates and one of the things
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
that I found is sort of a durable
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
narrative is it is it is devolved in
 
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
many cases to almost like
 
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
World War one trench warfare where one
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
side argues for economic growth the
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
other Assad argues for Revenue
 
00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.390 align:start position:0%
other Assad argues for Revenue
maximization

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
maximization
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
and uh well I think well I think we've
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
seen uh the benefits of the tax release
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
we've we've achieved over the Arc of the
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
last eight years now since starting with
 
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
the first uh First Tax release was
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
passed in the 2015 budget or I guess
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
eventually what became the 2015 budget
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
and so I said how how do we sort of
 
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
break through that narrative how do you
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
shift the focus and try to try to put
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
some uh color to the words that you're
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
talking about when you're discussing uh
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
the components of of uh the business
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
taxes and and its impact on the state
 
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
so what I did is I went to Fred no no
 
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
not the clerk uh Fred is a Federal
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
Reserve economic data which is a
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
byproduct of the sorry sorry
 
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a byproduct of the Federal
 
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
Reserve of uh of St Louis and it's a
 
00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
great Warehouse of data
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
and so what I did is I said okay we
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
started this tax relief in 2015. we made
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
the argument that it was going to
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
provide going to provide economic growth
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
and this was going to be a pro-growth
 
00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:29.459 align:start position:0%
policy so let's see how that's worked
 
00:09:29.459 --> 00:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
policy so let's see how that's worked
out

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
so if you look at this the uh the second
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
column the GDP from 2015 to 2021 growth
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh that's on the percentage basis based
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the Fred data
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
and I said okay well if that's the case
 
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019 align:start position:0%
let's look at the that's six years worth
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
of data uh 2022 by the way 2022 data is
 
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
not available yet uh Department of
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
Commerce won't put that out until March
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
so we won't have 2022 state level data
 
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
until until for several months so we
 
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
looked at him we said okay
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
six years that's what it's done so I
 
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
said okay let's reference into the prior
 
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
six years how did we what's changed over
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
the Arc of those six years and that's
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
the first column
 
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I think you'll notice that there's
 
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
been a substantial amount of growth in
 
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
our in our economy in over the Arc of
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
the last six years
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll note that similar to New
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2015 Maine actually passed
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
a major tax reform
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
unlike New Hampshire it wasn't tax
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
relief it was tax reform
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
with where they lowered their individual
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
and corporate rates and then raise their
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
sales tax so they offset
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
they offset the reductions and shifted
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
it over to the sales tax so I think
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that those two states that
 
00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:46.339 align:start position:0%
made those major tax
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
changes are the two states that have
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
seen Far and Away the greatest economic
 
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
growth in the region
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the region what
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see is Massachusetts seems to be
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
pegged pretty close closely to Nash to
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
National growth I think that's pretty
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
consistent by the way the national one I
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
as a just as a data Proviso
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh National Data is done on a quarterly
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
basis so the national isn't exactly
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples so I just picked a
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
reference point of Q4 the relative years
 
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
as opposed to going uh Fred just offers
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
annual data for the states they offer
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
quarterly data for for the national so
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's one one point of the data
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
but I think that that it tells a
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
compelling story and I think it shows
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
how a state that was actually falling
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
behind the national growth Trends has
 
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
actually pulled well ahead of national
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
growth Trends and that to me is is a
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
symbol of of prosperity that's
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately what we're looking for in our
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
in our economy and in our society is
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
trying to how do we find ways to
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
increase prosperity
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
and when you look at a data like this it
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
gives it it paints a clearer picture
 
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
that shows that the the steps we're
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
taking are steps in the right direction
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
these are positive steps that are
 
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
improving the lives of granted stators
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
so we think that's an important thing to
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
continue we specifically think it's
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
important to continue in the business
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax which
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I I could tell a long story but I'll
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
try to be very succinct about it in a
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
prior life I worked as a
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
corporate Communications company and
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
working with high techs and in greater
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
Boston area
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
and I had a company that moved from New
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to Massachusetts and I expect
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
I asked him I expected typically the
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
answer you get why companies move to
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts access to access to staff
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
and and they said tax reasons which was
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
just confusing to me and then they
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
explained the business Enterprise tax
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
and how
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
companies that are capital intensive
 
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.370 align:start position:0%
companies that are capital intensive
companies

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
are losing money uh startups that's a
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
bet that's what they're burning through
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
their capital and they're losing money
 
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
and they're still paying taxes so that
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
was that always uh struck a chord with
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
me and that's why I think that that this
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
reduction in the business Enterprise tax
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
is so critical because I think it's
 
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
important not just for small businesses
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
and in fact I I it's it's a case last
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
year when we had this this discussion I
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
know there was a legislation House Bill
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
1221 which produced both the BPT and the
 
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
BET and I remember having a conversation
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
with with the chair at the time and and
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
played with them and listen if you have
 
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:22.940 align:start position:0%
to pick one pick the bet not the BPT but
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
they went the other direction but we
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
think that this is critical to continue
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
our economic growth I we think that the
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
the revenue picture for the state since
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the state started this uh business tax
 
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
regime change has has shown that that
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
we've seen significant surpluses in our
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
business tax lines and I think that the
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
the economic growth shows a compelling
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
story as to why we should continue it so
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
for that reason I encourage you to find
 
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
a spill out to pass I'd be happy to take
 
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.530 align:start position:0%
a spill out to pass I'd be happy to take
questions

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh other
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
hands up yes representative plett yes
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh Mr
 
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.170 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh Mr
Moore

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
Moore
 
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.009 align:start position:0%
Moore
um

00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
you you're attributing apparently the
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
large growth in New Hampshire to the
 
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
reduction in business profit taxes
 
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
solely or is it there are other causes
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
possibly I I promise you that there are
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
that there is multi-factors involved
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
here I guarantee you that that there's a
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
lot more going on than than just
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
business taxes I'm sure I'm sure the the
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
fellows in the the second corner corner
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
office would take credit for a lot of
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
those but uh I would say I would say to
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
you that that when you look at this this
 
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
picture it paints a picture of a state
 
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's heading in the right direction is
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
seeing accelerating economic growth and
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
one and one that uh that is worth
 
00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.339 align:start position:0%
continuing now
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
are there other factors of course or
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
other factors and and there's no way to
 
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
say this is inputs and outputs but I
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
will note that the two states that made
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
major what I would describe as
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
beneficial tax reforms are the two
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
states that are seeing the outliers in
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
terms of economic growth you just
 
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
representative almi then representative
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
there it goes
 
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.530 align:start position:0%
there it goes
um

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:11.420 align:start position:0%
have you
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
looked at on these numbers going from on
 
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.350 align:start position:0%
looked at on these numbers going from on
07

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
07
 
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.790 align:start position:0%
07
[Music]

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
to 13 and 13 to or or even 15 and then
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
15 up on but looked at at
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
the scope across the years of what
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
happened in in
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
the in New England and in New Hampshire
 
00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:47.339 align:start position:0%
we have always had a history of being
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
the last state in in the last state out
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
of the recession on and
 
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
09 is
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
actually oh mostly 08 Revenue
 
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.870 align:start position:0%
actually oh mostly 08 Revenue
and

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
was just starting to go into a recession
 
00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:08.569 align:start position:0%
was just starting to go into a recession
on

00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:11.090 align:start position:0%
on
but

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
we really
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
um you
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to just cherry pick
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
certain dates and come on is there a
 
00:16:22.329 --> 00:16:22.339 align:start position:0%
question that's totally different from
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh the one that you just made and have
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
you looked at the other alternatives
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me representative I'm not
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
exactly sure I understand your question
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
when you say the Alternatives could you
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
please clarify if you
 
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
a few years earlier in each time's
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
growth or you looked at on
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
seven years starting early or seven
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
years and then uh if or if you just did
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
what is usually done which is to take a
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
chart a a chart and track across the
 
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.449 align:start position:0%
chart a a chart and track across the
years

00:17:01.449 --> 00:17:01.459 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
on in on New England versus New
 
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.150 align:start position:0%
on in on New England versus New
Hampshire

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes because uh because I
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
if you go to the Fred charts it has
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
historical data going back about 30
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
years so you can't avoid looking at the
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
chart it's it's right there when you go
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
to the data source
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd encourage you to go take a
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
look at it because one of the things
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
that I found is is and this is GDP it's
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
not tax revenue and the two are not the
 
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
same and I'm not I'm not suggesting the
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
two are the same uh but it's a lot
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
smoother than I would have anticipated
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure the revenue cycle is very
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
different than
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
than the GDP cycle I'm not trying to
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
conflate the two here
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to say the argument
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
for people who've supported this is has
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
been about economic growth not
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily Revenue growth and and I and
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
I want to clarify that that I I made
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
that point clear at the very beginning
 
00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
that's that's been sort of the the
 
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
dichotomy that we've had over the Arc of
 
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you have a
 
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.930 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you have a
question

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
you did not representative ulery
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair appreciate it
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Mr
 
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.010 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Mr
Moore

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
Moore
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
um you're equating
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
um economic growth with prosperity and
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
with prosperity you're then equating
 
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:25.340 align:start position:0%
that with uh increased revenues and
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
presented a chart to show that
 
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
what happens in a recession though when
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
Prosperity goes down state revenues are
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to go down
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
if we reduce the
 
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.130 align:start position:0%
if we reduce the
bet

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
bet
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
would not then the state
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
lose money because we reduced this and
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
so so as someone who uh as as you know
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
has been through a down economic cycle
 
00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:58.700 align:start position:0%
in a different role
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
we had to make some pretty significant
 
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.029 align:start position:0%
we had to make some pretty significant
um

00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:04.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
recalibrations I'll just I'll say it
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no question that that
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
there's a cyclicality to the economy and
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
as a policy maker the question isn't do
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
we do we uh ignore the cyclicality
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
because the reality is is we can we can
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
prepare for that type of cyclicality
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
whether it's a rainy day fund uh
 
00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:27.419 align:start position:0%
alternate Revenue sources that there's a
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
there are ways to harden uh and protect
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
the state's ability to pay its bills
 
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
during an economy and I know that that
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
again the governor likes to speak very
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
regularly about our rather flush rainy
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
day fund as it stands right now
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
um frankly frankly I think that probably
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
should do more there but but I know that
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
there are limits in state law as to what
 
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
you can do in that space uh I've
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
encouraged him that he should direct
 
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
more of the Surplus to that as opposed
 
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
to one-time spending but
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
I I don't always get what I want either
 
00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.549 align:start position:0%
I I don't always get what I want either
so

00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
so the answer to the answer to your
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
question I think is is that is that yes
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
there are Revenue cycles that that
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
accompany economic cycles and but there
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.810 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
you indicate there are ways to hedge
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
against them would reducing this tax
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
be one of those ways because it would
 
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
make the companies more resilient
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
um the more
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
more better or
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
more capable or of competing with other
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
um entities both within and without the
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
state and thus allowing them rather than
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
reducing the the amount of revenue
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
generated would actually be able to
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
either sustain or or maybe even in some
 
00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:54.539 align:start position:0%
instances increase the amount of revenue
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
generated because they would be
 
00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
funneling off less
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
per sale to an account is that is that
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
an analysis sure I certainly have having
 
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:07.340 align:start position:0%
a more competitive and heartier
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
employers definitely helps with dealing
 
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
with recessionary woes I definitely
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
think that that this tax in particular
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
suits that purpose more so than the BPT
 
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
simply because this this tax is you more
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
focused on actually New Hampshire small
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
businesses than the BPT so the bet I
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
think from that cyclicality standpoint
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
is probably a better tool to ensure
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
long-term stability in the among
 
00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:36.830 align:start position:0%
long-term stability in the among
employers

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
so I do have a question this time
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
good morning morning
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
could you provide us with the year by
 
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
could you provide us with the year by
year

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
GDP growth
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
from which this summary data was
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
extracted so that it would show
 
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:04.100 align:start position:0%
going back to
 
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
2001 let's say
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh before the 2008 start point of your
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
data and forward to as far as we can go
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
which I guess is not including 2022 as
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
you pointed out it's not available
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so we could see year by year the
 
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:25.940 align:start position:0%
growth and take whatever chunks of that
 
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
we think are relevant or how they relate
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
to other phenomena that are going on
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
around us and
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
draw conclusions if they're warranted
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
but at least be able to see the whole
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
whole picture that you were looking at
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
when you broke it down into these
 
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
basically two periods could you know
 
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
that sure and again the reason why I
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
picked 2009 as a starting period is
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
because it was six years versus six
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
years trying to get the Apples to Apples
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
as much as I understand that but I
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
understand your point certainly the
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
beginning of that started in a pretty
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
recessionary period yeah so that would
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
be helpful if we could have that
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative Shamrock
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm sorry I'm late
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
I hit PT this morning but appreciate it
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
what about the
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
current Tech layoffs and the new
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
announcement this morning
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
at Yankee Candle of a 13 reduction in
 
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:29.780 align:start position:0%
its Workforce that is going to be uh
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
enforced soon
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
begin to see
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the next quarter a reduction of uh uh
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
bring forth enough revenue for for this
 
00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:56.690 align:start position:0%
bring forth enough revenue for for this
state

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:57.860 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm willing to admit that I'm not an
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
economist by trade so so predicting what
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
might happen economically uh I will say
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
say that there's no question as we're
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
seeing the Federal Reserve uh go through
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
its current regime of of significant uh
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
interest rate rate hikes it obviously
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
doesn't help the economy uh on the other
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
hand inflation doesn't help the economy
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
either so you know you have to pick one
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
of the pick your poison there
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
I would say I would say that one of the
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
things that I've noted is that in New
 
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.090 align:start position:0%
things that I've noted is that in New
Hampshire

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I think there's an interesting thing
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
to track
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
that even though our unemployment rate
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
is going up the number of employed
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
residents is also going up
 
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.070 align:start position:0%
residents is also going up
uh

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
I will note that that based upon the
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
last uh the numbers that came out last
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
week a week ago to oh actually it was
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
Wednesday of last week because of the
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
holiday uh
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
noted that that we are still 6 000
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
people working fewer than we were in
 
00:24:59.330 --> 00:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic so six thousand fewer
 
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299 align:start position:0%
people working
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
and our labor force is 10 000 people
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
fewer than it was prior to uh prior to
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
the coveted pandemic so
 
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
the big takeaway there is is that New
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers are still hiring
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
they're still hiring uh and what's even
 
00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:18.299 align:start position:0%
better is that more people are coming
 
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
back into the workforce
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
now that they're coming back into the
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
workforce in greater numbers and more
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
people are being employed obviously is
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
is something that we need to consider
 
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
but you talk to employers they think
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing not a bad thing
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
because they have more people applying
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
for those positions whereas it was a
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
pretty scarce and as someone who's who's
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do some hiring myself I will
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
say that I will say that it is for a
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
while it was pretty bleak out there and
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
and so the idea of more people
 
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
re-entering the workforce is a very
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
positive thing but to this to the extent
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
that that we may or may not have a
 
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:52.100 align:start position:0%
recession going forward
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
good news is is uh we haven't yet seen
 
00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
that level of major layoffs here in New
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I guess that's speaks the
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
fact that we don't have any Tech Giants
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
working in our state I don't know if
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's a good or a bad thing as the
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
answers will vary uh but but we we've
 
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
had a pretty good run of it so far and
 
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.810 align:start position:0%
had a pretty good run of it so far and
again

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
but you see the unemployment rate go up
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
it doesn't just necessarily mean things
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
are going bad if you see the
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate going up but the
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
number of employee people going down
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
that's obviously a sign of concern but
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
when the unemployment rate is going up
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
because more people are pulling being
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
pulled back into the workforce I think
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
that's actually a positive sign
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
for for New Hampshire for New Hampshire
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
not a lot of other states aren't seeing
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
that that same Dynamic where they're
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
seeing their employment rates go you
 
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
know the actual number of employed go
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
down thank you
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
we have seven more pink cards and 35
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
minutes so if I could ask the speakers
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
coming up to testify if you could leave
 
00:26:54.409 --> 00:26:54.419 align:start position:0%
your remarks to about three minutes that
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
way we have a little bit of time for
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
questions representative Horgan could
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for letting me
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
jump the queue so I'm representative
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan from Stratford County
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
District 10 which is the town of Durham
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
my district keeps getting smaller every
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm opposed to this bill
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
because I don't think first of all I
 
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
don't think of any of the so-called
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
supply side effects that uh that are
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
that are being predicted
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
um predicted for this bill um I right
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
this doesn't necessarily mean a marriage
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
it was a long time ago but I actually
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
did study tax policy and economics with
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
the father supply side economics Arthur
 
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
B Laffer back when he's a young economic
 
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
professor at USC and he's University of
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
Southern California Navy is still around
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
and he would probably
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
if he was here he probably fell out a
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
pink card the other way saying he's in
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
favor of it but that's okay so the uh
 
00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
0.05 percent
 
00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
um which is basically next to nothing so
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
um supply side effects kick in only when
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
first of all only when you have a
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
significant change in the tax rate and
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
one that people are confident will be
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
around to make a difference and it also
 
00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
only kicks in
 
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
um if you're incentivizing people to do
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
some businesses to do something
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
different than what they were doing
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
already so it's it's a tiny change you
 
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
could probably
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
lower the rate to zero Without Really
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
affecting the behavior of businesses at
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
all you wouldn't be doing anything
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
except uh reduce the amount of tax
 
00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:30.299 align:start position:0%
revenue to the state
 
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
and um so I would uh I would just say
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
this uh bill is not it's not worth the
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
time it's not going to have any positive
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's not going to have any effect other
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
than simply merely reducing revenue and
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
also the incentives on the BET and you
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
know it's not a perfect tax and also
 
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's very very close to being an income
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
tax and the only thing that keeps you
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
from being broad-based is that it's only
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
applied to like certain types of
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprises not to every organization
 
00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
economy but
 
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.250 align:start position:0%
economy but
um the

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:00.260 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
businesses are not businesses are not
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
going to reduce the amount of uh you
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
know the amount of whatever
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of work they do just because
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
uh just because of this tax even if we
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
lowered it from 0.55 to zero so 0.55 to
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
0.5 is just so minuscule it's not going
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
to make any difference at all so I would
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
just uh urge you to oppose the Bill
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
would you be open to questions I'm sure
 
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
yes I guess any questions
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
okay we will uh next welcome up Mr Simon
 
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
House Ways and Means Committee my name
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
is Simon Thompson and I'm here on behalf
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the 1400 small businesses in New
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are members of the
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
national Federation of Independent
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
businesses uh state director for nfib
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
Bruce Berkey submitted written testimony
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
I've passed that up this morning I'm not
 
00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
going to read it I'm just going to touch
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
on a couple points
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
as we've heard House Bill 15 will reduce
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax bet to the
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
rate of 0.5 of 1 percent
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh last year this legislator enacted the
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
final step in taking the business
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
profits tax down to the 7.5 percent but
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as we heard earlier the
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
BET did not make it cross the the finish
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
line and go to 0.5 but I do want to
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
remind members of this committee that
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
bet is a particular interest to the
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
small business community and our members
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because of its direct
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
impact on costs for a small business
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of new faces here on this
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
committee but some of the returning
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
members are aware the BET reduction was
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
first discussed during and by then
 
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
former Governor Hassan's Administration
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
seven years ago a series of four small
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
and prudent Cuts were enacted into law
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
the first two cuts were implemented but
 
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
the third and fourth were stalled due to
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
subsequent legislative action and of
 
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
course the pandemic
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
since the height of the pandemic the
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
third cut was enacted and now New
 
00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's small businesses Community
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
is asking you to finally enact the final
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
cut so again on behalf of the 1400s
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
small business members in New Hampshire
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
I respectfully request that you consider
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
octopass on House Bill 15. thank you
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%

would you yield to questions thank you
 
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.529 align:start position:0%
would you yield to questions thank you
anyone

00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:43.909 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
tell me first
 
00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.870 align:start position:0%
tell me first
on

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.010 align:start position:0%
on
their

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
how many of the do you know if on
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
how many of the 1400 small businesses in
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which generally I think
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
you use a uh
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
a identifier of
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
the federal identifier which is under
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
500 employees so that's pretty much all
 
00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:17.179 align:start position:0%
the businesses in New Hampshire on is
 
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
on is that true and do you know how many
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
of them pay BPT as well I do not know
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
how many of the 1400 members pay BPT
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I do know that most of our 1400
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
members are extremely small businesses
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
I'm talking two five maybe ten uh
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
employee companies so I do not know how
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
many pay both uh the BPT or bet all I do
 
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
know and we talked about this with with
 
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%
our members
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
um last year uh similar to Mr Moore's
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
testimony you know we were kind of
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
hoping that if one was going to get
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
chopped off the block it was the BPT and
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
not the bet that's the one that impacts
 
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
our members
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
could I just do a quick follow-up quick
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up please thank you can you give
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
us a something that says how many
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
businesses are like under 25
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
and under
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
50 and above so you're kind of wanting a
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
little bit of a kind of a breakdown of
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
our membership in their sizes yes okay
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
representative Ulrich did you have a
 
00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:26.570 align:start position:0%
representative Ulrich did you have a
question

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair uh real
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
quickly uh you indicated that uh this
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
was an important tax for your members
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
um which represents the largest part of
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
the business community in the in the
 
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.710 align:start position:0%
the business community in the in the
state

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.909 align:start position:0%
state
um

00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
because it had a direct impact upon
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
business costs that's a general phrase
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
could you give some specifics as to how
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
half a half of a half a percent
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
is going to affect the business I mean
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
the mom and pop store the Palmer's
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
Market or something like that is that
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
how does that affect that business and
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
to what degree yeah so I don't know if I
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
can answer to what degree as far as a
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
percentage or a dollar amount on on how
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
this will affect their bottom line but
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is despite prior
 
00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:17.389 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is despite prior
testimony

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
although very small reduction it is
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
still a reduction and when you have a
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
small business that is trying to just
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
keep the lights on keep maybe an extra
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
staff person on staff this little
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
reduction will be tremendously important
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
to them I do not have a specific dollar
 
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
amount that I can share with you
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative right now
 
00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
we're very polite up here we defer to
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
um until until the until the end of the
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah so uh
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
perhaps you've noticed that the there's
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact statement on this bill
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
um and the uh it's
 
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
it's uh phrased as the cumulative fiscal
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
impact of the proposed legislation
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
compared to current law
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
the uh the calculation that's here shows
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
that by the time this tax is fully in
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
place that's tax reduction is fully in
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
place the loss of Revenue
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
and again this is just a static analysis
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
would be about
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
28.3 million dollars
 
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.930 align:start position:0%
28.3 million dollars
um

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
do you recognize that we will lose
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
revenue from uh tax cut Bill like this
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
even though it's a small rate there will
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
be a loss of Revenue overall and that
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
that will make it more difficult for the
 
00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
state to provide services to your
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
membership well what I guess I would
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
answer that question is what I would
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
recognize is that over the last few
 
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
years as we've
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
progress with these tax cuts both BPT
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
and bet that that's not I mean the
 
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
revenue is increased and it's the
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
projections of the Ways and Means
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
Committee last year
 
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.230 align:start position:0%
Committee last year
um

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
we're good but we're we're we're far
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
outpacing them so
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
that would be the answer that question
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:34.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
do you uh phrase it the same way do you
 
00:36:40.569 --> 00:36:40.579 align:start position:0%
recognize that in the last three years
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
there have been exceptional
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances including a huge amount of
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds flowing into the state
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
that have affected our uh revenues
 
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.450 align:start position:0%
that have affected our uh revenues
significantly

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I would not recognize that
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%

00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
as you know there are many things about
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's tax code that make the
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
state especially attractive to
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
individual taxpayers most notably of
 
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
course is that New Hampshire and Alaska
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
are the only two states without a
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
broad-based individual income tax on
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
wage income and without a Statewide
 
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
retail sales tax and these factors are
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
really instrumental in New Hampshire
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
having the sixth best overall ranking on
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
the tax Foundation State business tax
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
climate index that's a report we've
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
published every year for the past 20
 
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
years that seeks to compare the
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of state's tax
 
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.490 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of state's tax
structures

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
structures
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
now tax policy is all about trade-offs
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
and because you have relatively low
 
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:42.740 align:start position:0%
taxes imposed directly on individuals
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
the result of that is that you end up
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
with pretty high taxes on businesses
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
including the business profits tax as
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
well as the business Enterprise tax
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the BPT
 
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
specifically alone by itself separate
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
from the BET and compare that rate to
 
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
the other states around the country New
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the 16th highest corporate
 
00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%
income tax rate in the country
 
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
and um of course the BPT and the bet
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
both fall not just on C corporations but
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
on many other types of business entities
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
including small businesses LLC in many
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
different forms like LLCs Partnerships
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
proprietorships and others
 
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
now with that being said as the others
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
have mentioned both the BPT and the BET
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
have rightfully been prioritized for
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
reduction over the past few years so to
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
the extent that the state has the
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
ability to do so it would be wise to
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
continue working to reduce both of those
 
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.290 align:start position:0%
continue working to reduce both of those
rates

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
and given New Hampshire's current budget
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
slur plus and history of strong Revenue
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
growth trimming the BET to 0.5 would
 
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
return extra tax revenue to taxpayers in
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
a manner that would make the state more
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
attractive to business investment and
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
long-term economic growth
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note for House Bill 15 the
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
Administration estimates that the
 
00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:06.980 align:start position:0%
reduction would reduce revenues by about
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
28.3 million dollars once the effects of
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
the reduction are fully felt and for the
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
sake of comparison New Hampshire brought
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
in about 2.2 billion dollars in tax
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
collections in FY 2022 so this tax cut
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
amounts to about 1.3 percent of actual
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
FY 2022 collections and this could
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
reasonably be expected to be paid for
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
out of the state's Revenue growth
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
without needing offsets
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
one thing I do want to note though is
 
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
that the BPT is the more economically
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
harmful of the two taxes so it is
 
00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
something to take into consideration
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
when deciding how much to prioritize
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
reducing one versus the other the BPT is
 
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
a narrow-based high rate tax that
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
generates a relatively volatile source
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
of Revenue while the bet is a
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
comparatively broader based lower rate
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
tax that applies to more businesses but
 
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
it also generates a Stabler source of
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue and is less distortive in terms
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
of its effects on the on the economy and
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
on businesses economic decision making
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
so ultimately keeping both the BPT and
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
the BET rates on a downward Direction on
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
a downward trajectory will help generate
 
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
continued business investment and strong
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
economic growth here in New Hampshire
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
and I am happy to take any questions
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative ulery oh who's going
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
first representative Schamberg and then
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.670 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
representative

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question the
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
question I have is do you have any uh
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
data to show the investment in long-term
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
growth statements that you make here
 
00:41:43.859 --> 00:41:44.990 align:start position:0%
growth statements that you make here
uh

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
from the past Cuts we've had
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
I don't have the specific numbers with
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
me at the time but looking at the GDP
 
00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
trajectory we have seen a lot of growth
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as well as Revenue
 
00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:01.339 align:start position:0%
growth I know in the past about decade
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
revenues have grown in nominal terms by
 
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
about 82 percent here and in real terms
 
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know the exact figure but the
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
state remains on a growth trajectory
 
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
despite all the cuts that have been made
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
over the past five or so years and so
 
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
that can be expected to continue
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question I've got uh two of
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
them here that you just said you seem to
 
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
be in your equating in your presentation
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
that a business uh Enterprise tax is
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
equivalent to an income tax can you just
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
flesh that out a little bit for the
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
committee let's explain how that works
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
sure of course you know it it's
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
comparable to an income tax but it is
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
more like an income based value-added
 
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
tax and so it is unique in the country
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
in being of this tax structure so it's
 
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
hard to compare it to really anything
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
else in the United States but because of
 
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
the way it is structured it ends up
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
being more like a universal consumption
 
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
tax which is a relatively less
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
economically distortive type of tax
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
compared to the BPT which is more like a
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
traditional corporate income tax that in
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also applies to uh what
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
are traditionally passed through
 
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
businesses in other states
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
I see other hands up let's go to them
 
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
first please representative fellows
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm new to the committee so I you
 
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
know some of these things are going
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
right over my head but your first bullet
 
00:43:42.609 --> 00:43:42.619 align:start position:0%
here says that New Hampshire and Alaska
 
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
are are the only two states that don't
 
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
have an income tax or uh retail sales
 
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.089 align:start position:0%
have an income tax or uh retail sales
tax

00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:50.099 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm I know Alaska they have a lot of
 
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
oil money that they even give back to
 
00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
their citizens so what in New Hampshire
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
where is the trade-off if we don't have
 
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
those where are we
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
you know shifting that cost to sure
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely and just to clarify there are
 
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
a number of other states that either
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't have an individual income tax or
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
that don't have a corporate income tax
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire and Alaska are the
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
only two that don't have a wage income
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
tax or a retail sales tax on a Statewide
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
basis Alaska has local sales taxes but
 
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is pretty unique
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
in not having those two major taxes on
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
individuals you end up resulting in a
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
tax code that relies heavily on business
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
taxes and a number of smaller
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
taxes are generating more Revenue than
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
they might in other states that rely
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
more heavily on those major income and
 
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear you mention property taxes
 
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point of course New
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does rely really heavily on
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
property taxes and as a source of
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
Revenue the real property tax is
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
considered one of the best Revenue
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
raisers there is I know it's not
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
politically popular because you know
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
people get the bill in the mail and they
 
00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
pay it and it's often a large lump sum
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
but it relates closely the taxes that
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
are being paid on the property tax
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
relate really closely to the local
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
benefits received in a small state like
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire having a state property
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
tax levy makes some sense to it
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
generates a very stable source of
 
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue so it is one of the better taxes
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
while also avoiding some of the economic
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
yes it sounds like you agree with Mr
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
Thompson that there has been no effect
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the massive Federal stimuli that have
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
begun began in the Trump era and
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
continued in the Biden era
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
it's complicated is the short answer but
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
most of the revenue growth that has
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
occurred has been the result of
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
continued on Source Revenue growth in
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
States like New Hampshire where you know
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
businesses and individuals fared much
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
better throughout the pandemic than
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
anyone at first anticipated and so on
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
top of some of the federal stimulus
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
propping up people's incomes and
 
00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
businesses incomes
 
00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:41.339 align:start position:0%
that resulted in more Revenue but now
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we're out of the worst stages of
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
the pandemic we can expect continued
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue growth and you know to remain
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
back where we should be but even at a
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much very much for your
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.650 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
oh

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
one more question representative uh oars
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair thank
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so you
 
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned New Hampshire you've mentioned
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
Alaska overall you're looking at I
 
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
believe all the states the entire in
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
Washington DC you're based there
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
are you finding that as these business
 
00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
taxes go down Revenue overall goes up or
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
is what what are you seeing across the
 
00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:28.609 align:start position:0%
is what what are you seeing across the
country

00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and the short
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
answer is that in general yes uh
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
business taxes are the most harmful in
 
00:47:37.849 --> 00:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
terms of their impact on the economy and
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
so reductions in corporate income tax
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
rates have been shown to have one of the
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
biggest impacts in terms of helping
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
generate GDP growth in various States
 
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of academic literature out
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
there showing that corporate and then
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
individual income taxes have when those
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
rates are reduced States grow both in
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
terms of business investment and also in
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
terms of people wanting to live there
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
and being attracted to states where
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
their income isn't penalized in the same
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
way as it is elsewhere
 
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up question please
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
follow up so just for clarification so
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
across the entire spectrum of the conus
 
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that as a business taxes go
 
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
down the health of the business so on
 
00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
the revenues go up
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much of course thank you
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
again thank you
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
I would like to recognize David Trumbull
 
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me my name is David
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
Trumbull I'm from where New Hampshire
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
I'm a small business owner I stand
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill for several reasons
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
first I believe it's fiscally
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
irresponsible the state has like Most
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
states around the country a surplus
 
00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
right now that's a one-time Surplus
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
because of the massive trillions of
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
dollars that the federal government gave
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
to the states to help bail them out of
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
all the issues dealing with covid that
 
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
is around the country when that Surplus
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
ends we will not be able to fund the
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
programs that we need to run our state
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
adequately and by cutting this tax now
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
what you're basically saying to people
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
after that Surplus is gone too bad for
 
00:49:28.609 --> 00:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
all those essential services that you
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
want the appropriate way to run a state
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
or any business is to have a steady
 
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
stream of Revenue coming in we should
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
not be cutting this tax at this time one
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
of the previous speakers said well we
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
can use the rainy day fund we all know
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that ready rainy day
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
fund never amounts too much and it's
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
very small we said we can all
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
alternative Revenue Services sources New
 
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not pass any of these
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
major alternative Revenue sources so
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's really no other way to do it
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
this policy exists we should maintain
 
00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
this tax in place second is we need
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
Public Services individuals and
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
businesses count on our towns our
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities our cities in the state
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
to provide essential Services whether
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's substance abuse or Roads
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
Maintenance or helping our seniors our
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
nursing homes all of these are essential
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
services without them our businesses
 
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
cannot Thrive if you cut off at the
 
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
knees our municipalities and our towns
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
from providing these Services you will
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
be doing significant damage to the
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
business Community as well as to the
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
individuals in this state an earlier
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
speaker talked about promises being made
 
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
we have to live up to them we had a
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
promise about this tax made so many
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
years ago we made promises decades ago
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
that we have not lived up to in this
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
state we closed the state hospital and
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
promised to set up a functioning
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Services around
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
the state and we never fully funded it
 
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
we have all these lawsuits going back to
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
Claremont that said we will deal with
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
the poor town a poor property Town
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
versus Rich property Town dilemma and
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
we've never dealt with that either we
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
have decades-old promises that we have
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
not met in this state and the only way
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
to do that is of adequate funding
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
cutting funding now will mean that we're
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
saying to those old promises well we're
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
never going to deal with you the last
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
question is what's the how that's the
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
best way to build your economy some
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
people say trickle down some people say
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
build up I would say the best way to
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
build a strong economy is from the
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
ground up we need strong schools in this
 
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
state the property poor towns cannot
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
adequately fund their their schools they
 
00:51:23.089 --> 00:51:23.099 align:start position:0%
are spending around fifteen or sixteen
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per pupil the property
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
Rich towns are spending almost 30 000
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
per pupil what does that mean that means
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
that either you fix the roof or you have
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
programs for the gifted children you
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
have special ed and you have other
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
programs in your schools the property
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
poor towns can't do it all you look at
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
those schools look at the proficiency
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
results at the Department of Education
 
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
websites and compare a property rich
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
town with a property poor town right
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
next to each other and you'll see a
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
massive difference the property poor
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
towns have so many children who are at
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
level one the property Rich towns have
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
so many children at level four it's
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
there the money makes a difference and
 
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
this leads to a generational issue where
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
many people in these property poor towns
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
they don't go to college their children
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
don't go to college because they weren't
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
brought up in a family that says you're
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
going to go to college if you went to
 
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
college your children are more likely to
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
go there when you do your income goes up
 
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
when your income goes up your ability to
 
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
pay taxes goes up if you want to build a
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
stable long-term Revenue source for New
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fund your schools if you cut
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
this tax you won't be able to adequately
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
fund your schools so I would urge you to
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
please do not pass these tax reductions
 
00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:27.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony would you
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
be open to questions of course
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
I had trouble following the link between
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
this business Enterprise taxes being
 
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
discussed and uh school funding I
 
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:45.020 align:start position:0%
thought that came from swept so
 
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
enlighten me
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
okay the relationship is this you can
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
say that's a separate piece of the pie
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with it but when
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
you sit down to look at how the state
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
budget all gets put together you have a
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
giant pie and so if the total revenue is
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
reduced the size of the pie is reduced
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
so then when you go over to look at
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
property tax rather school funding
 
00:53:08.569 --> 00:53:08.579 align:start position:0%
you're going to say okay we have less
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
money available the size of the pie is
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
smaller if you have a bigger amount of
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
funding then you don't have so many
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
competing concerns it's you can't really
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh actually say that they're completely
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
separate because it's one giant state
 
00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:23.809 align:start position:0%
separate because it's one giant state
budget

00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:26.579 align:start position:0%

for the opportunity to testify here
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
today my name is Dennis Hall I am state
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
affairs coordinator at Americans for tax
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
reform we are an organization non-profit
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
based out of DC and I'm here on behalf
 
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
of Grover norquist and my organization
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
to urge you guys to support HP 15 and
 
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
this critical tax relief for small
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
businesses and companies throughout New
 
00:55:44.339 --> 00:55:45.170 align:start position:0%
businesses and companies throughout New
Hampshire

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
so in my short time
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
in the world of policy I've realized
 
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
that the rhetoric surrounding corporate
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
income taxes has largely obscures the
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
nature and the impact of these taxes a
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
lot of people think it's some pie in the
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
sky abstract entity that pays these
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
taxes but in reality it's paid by you
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
and me when we go to the store and pay
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
higher prices it's paid by employees of
 
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
these companies who often do not have as
 
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
high of a wage as they would otherwise
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
when the federal government takes 21 of
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
all corporate income entrepreneurs
 
00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
suffer from a lack of opportunity to
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
invest greater funds in their productive
 
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.910 align:start position:0%
invest greater funds in their productive
capacities

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
capacities
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
and grow their business and investments
 
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
in the state and I think this is
 
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
particularly relevant for small
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
businesses who tend to suffer from a
 
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
smaller profit margins a lack of
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
extensive infrastructure and a harder
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
time finding employees particularly in a
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
labor shortage when they're up against
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
large companies with significantly more
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
funding and ability to take on debt
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
reducing the business Enterprise tax
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
rate gives a real opportunity to
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
thousands of small businesses to compete
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
for Quality Labor offer higher wages to
 
00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
their employees and expand investment in
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
their productive capabilities across the
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I won't deny
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
that point zero five percent is a
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
relatively small number but we have to
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
remember that just six short years ago
 
00:57:05.809 --> 00:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
the rate was 0.75 percent which means we
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
have given small businesses an effective
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
tax cut of more than 25 percent in just
 
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
six years and this is another
 
00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.630 align:start position:0%
six years and this is another
opportunity

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
to invest in our small businesses across
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
the state and offer the opportunity for
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
more small businesses and entrepreneurs
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
to move here and raise their families
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
and live and work here it is these small
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
steady and consistent reforms that add
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
up and make New Hampshire the most
 
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
competitive economy in the Northeast and
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
prove to Americans across the country
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
that this is the place to work to live
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
and to start and succeed as an
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur so I commend you for the
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
progress that has already been made and
 
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
I hope you will consider embracing this
 
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
new opportunity to offer even greater
 
00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
relief to current and potential
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses in New
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for your time
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
would you be open to questions I
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't thank you uh representative all
 
00:57:58.319 --> 00:57:59.569 align:start position:0%
wouldn't thank you uh representative all
me

00:57:59.569 --> 00:57:59.579 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
do do you
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
what do you think the state of New
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be depending on for the
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
essential services that the businesses
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
need and that they are not getting
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
enough of even now
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
the local property tax only
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
I do agree with much of what Miss Lau
 
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
had said about um sort of having a
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
broad-based tax system I would prefer
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily a higher sales tax
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
rate but sales and property taxes are
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
generally a better way to go and these
 
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
are the policies that we would support
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
over something like an income tax or
 
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
even a corporate income tax particularly
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
for small businesses and with the
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax if you lower
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
this rate you're giving small businesses
 
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to succeed and gain
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
enough income to the point where they do
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
reach the level where they're subject to
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and at that
 
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
point they're paying more than seven
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
percent and that's significantly more
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
revenue for the State of New Hampshire
 
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
so if you offer these small businesses
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to become medium or
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
large size businesses the revenue would
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
increase in that sense
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
um but I would I would always support a
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
sales sales or property tax over
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
something like an income tax or a
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
corporate income tax because these costs
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
are indeed paid by real people and tend
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
to impacts the economy in ways that are
 
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.329 --> 00:59:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.339 --> 00:59:51.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.900 --> 01:00:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
if you could both uh introduce
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
yourselves that'd be great good morning
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%

01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
the department does not have a position
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
on this bill we prepared a fiscal note
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
on this on this bill and we're here to
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions on it
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I've passed around our physical no
 
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
quick guide describing how we come to
 
01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:08.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
oh great representative Olney
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I've been waiting to ask you
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
about this on their
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know but you may know how many
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the businesses that pay business
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax are also paying business
 
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:35.660 align:start position:0%
on and my question is did You account
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
for the people that were paying would
 
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
have been were paying business
 
01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:47.780 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax at 5.5 going down to
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
0.055 to 0.05 and then having to pay the
 
01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
business profits tax on that 0.005
 
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
on did you account for what we gain from
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the ones that pay less
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
right no our calculations did not
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
account for for that move of the um of
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
from BET to BBT our calculations
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
essentially took all the uh the data
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
from the the bad payers and the revenue
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
that we received from from bet this is
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
from the fiscal year
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
um 20 basically 22 and from there we did
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
Static analysis
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
um projecting that uh the revenue impact
 
01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
going forward using the tax rate changes
 
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
from there
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
and that that's the results uh on that
 
01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
so the the fiscal impact showing in that
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
table before fiscal year 24 25 and 26
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the final cumulative fiscal impact
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
of 28 million
 
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
um we did not account for uh any
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
movements with with the BPT
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
just follow up follow up on is it
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
possible to do that
 
01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:16.930 align:start position:0%
possible to do that
foreign

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:16.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
we can look into it to see if we can to
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
do that calculation yeah thank you
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
yes the numbers on the table uh on the
 
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
bill they are a static analysis that is
 
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.130 align:start position:0%
bill they are a static analysis that is
correct

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
we'll be hearing a lot more from the dra
 
01:03:41.329 --> 01:03:41.339 align:start position:0%
coming up so just keep that in mind
 
01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh the fiscal impact that you've given
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
us appropriately is is addressed to this
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
specific uh rate cut in this bill can
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
you provide us
 
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.349 align:start position:0%
you provide us
um

01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
you've done it in pieces in the past but
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
with the entirety of the loss of Revenue
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
that has come with the movement from the
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
tax as it was
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
whatever it was five years ago
 
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
that that rate to the present
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
you see what I'm asking
 
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
yes yep we'll work on that but I do want
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
to mention that our calculations here
 
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.530 align:start position:0%
to mention that our calculations here
um

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we use the the fiscal year 22 cache
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
basis and then um we did account for the
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
the six percent uh bet and then the
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
point six percent to the point five five
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
percent bet uh rate reduction I'm
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
assuming that's not what you're
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
referring to representative
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
I didn't quite you what was your
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
starting point there uh
 
01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339 align:start position:0%
so a starting point for fiscal year 22
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
Cash basis no I want to go back further
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
to the start of the rate decline okay
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to answer oh we
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
have one over here yes representative
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
spilsbury thank you madam chairman I
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that I understand
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
the comments in the fiscal note
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
regarding the effect on the education
 
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
am I correct in understanding that
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
statute guarantees a half a percent
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund
 
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore that the cut from 0.55 to
 
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.470 align:start position:0%
and therefore that the cut from 0.55 to
0.5

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
0.5
 
01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
would come entirely out of the general
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
fund and have no impact on the education
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:24.059 align:start position:0%
the way it's it's being calculated right
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
now the uh with point five five percent
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
there is a percentage of the BET Revenue
 
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
that goes to the general fund and then
 
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh to the education trust fund as well
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
with a reduction of the 0.552. uh 0.05
 
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh 0.55 to 0.5 percent
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
at point five percent the way the
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
statute is written the entire bet
 
01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.069 align:start position:0%
statute is written the entire bet
Revenue

01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
collected would go to the education
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
trust fund with nothing going to the
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
so if if I understand you the Practical
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
effect is to confirm what I just
 
01:07:00.119 --> 01:07:05.210 align:start position:0%
effect is to confirm what I just
presumed

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
I think it's slightly different than
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
than um than what you've mentioned but
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
um the way that I've discussed that I
 
01:07:14.329 --> 01:07:14.339 align:start position:0%
mentioned just now is the way the
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
statute calculates uh that directs the
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
calculation of the the funds going into
 
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
which uh they're Revenue going into
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
which for either the general fund or the
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
this is something we can clarify over
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
coming weeks absolutely yes thank you so
 
01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:33.289 align:start position:0%
coming weeks absolutely yes thank you so
much

01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
okay anymore I think we're all up one
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
more representative fellows this is just
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
one tiny question
 
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
um a previous speaker said at one time
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
the um the rate was
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
0.75 so can you tell do you know
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
anything about the history of
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
where the what the rights have been I
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
don't even know how long the program's
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
been in place yes um so the the history
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the tax rates are on our website and
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh so back in the rates that I have
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
right now uh the historical race right
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
now is I had the earliest is 0.75
 
01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:11.750 align:start position:0%
now is I had the earliest is 0.75
percent

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
and this was for taxable years ending
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
before December 31 2016. and it's been
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
going down steadily um
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
through legislative process through
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
right now is 0.55 for uh tax peers
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other people here to
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
testify we will close the public hearing
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
we will now open up the public hearing
 
01:08:56.809 --> 01:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 133 relative to repealing
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
the communications Services tax
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
and for the record I pay that tax but
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
will participate
 
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:47.289 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:09:47.289 --> 01:09:47.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
there are several of us in this
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
committee who are co-sponsors of this
 
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
bill I just remembered and so that means
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to testify you cannot
 
01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
also be questioning the presenters so
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
welcome to reason means I recognize
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative Jason Osborne
 
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Jason Osborne
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
Rockingham uh two the towns of Auburn
 
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
Candia and Deerfield uh I am double
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
booked this morning so I'll get out of
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
your hair very quickly and if my
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
reputation precedes me uh you know I I
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
do like to be brief and I I do like
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
myself some tax cuts
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
so uh just real quickly um I'm not going
 
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
to tell you anything you don't already
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
know I'm sure about this uh particular
 
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
tax I know you've been working on it for
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
the last couple years uh as well just
 
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
real quickly the reason I brought it to
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
you uh this morning
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a relatively uh small tax
 
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:54.620 align:start position:0%
only about 30 million dollars in change
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh per year and I would like to just uh
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
suggest that
 
01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.310 align:start position:0%
suggest that
um

01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
you know uh fully repealing a tax is uh
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes better than just uh reducing
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
tax and leaving it on the books there
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
are some fixed costs associated with
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
collecting attacks that uh that are the
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
same no matter you know what what the
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
what the tax rate is
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that can be a good thing
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree to that what we
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
might not agree on uh is that uh you
 
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
know getting rid of attacks entirely
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
makes it much harder to bring back in
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
the future as opposed to increasing an
 
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
existing tax and so uh I think we can
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
agree on that point but maybe what we
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't agree on is whether that's a good
 
01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
thing or a bad thing right I I would
 
01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
suggest that uh that raising taxes is is
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
not good and therefore repealing one
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
entirely is is a benefit I would suggest
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
though that uh that of the tax uh cut or
 
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
repeal bills that you have to work on
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
this year this one is probably low
 
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.030 align:start position:0%
this year this one is probably low
priority

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
priority
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
the only reason I suggested it was just
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
because of the the relatively low dollar
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
amount I would hope that you would
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
strongly consider instead tackling
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
further the interest in dividends tax
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
which we already have set on the path to
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
being repealed in the future that being
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think the the probably the worst of
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
all possible taxes and that is a
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
disincentive on on savings which is the
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
very lifeblood of our human evolution I
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
mean without saving and deferring
 
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
consumption we would all you know still
 
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
be living in the woods eating twigs and
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
Chipmunks or whatever people in the
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
woods do I'm not in survival class
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
that's my kids so
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I I quite enjoy my uh my restaurants
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh that's all I have to say and
 
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
I'll uh be out of your hair if I may
 
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
would you understand questions I I would
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
if you really need to but uh like I said
 
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
I probably can't help you you guys are
 
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
the experts here so
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative Almy has a question it'll
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
be brief okay yes thank you uh this is
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
the same one I asked someone last time
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh how uh how do you think that we
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
should be funding the government
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
services in New Hampshire
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
well I think we have a a large number of
 
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
taxes on the on the books that we use to
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
fund the services in the state of New
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and all I might suggest is
 
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
that uh I
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay next we'll now recognize Dennis
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
um again I'm Dennis Hall with Americans
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
for tax reform
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
um I will start with an anecdote
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
I was formally paying almost a hundred
 
01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
dollars a month for cell phone service
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
when I turned 18. I was totally on my
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
own no support from my parents so I got
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
a bunch of my friends together
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
to create a family plan
 
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
um for cell phone service so I have
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
eight people on our plan we spend like
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
300 something dollars a month but it
 
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
gives me an opportunity to see what the
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
actual tax burden is when it comes to
 
01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
having multiple people on a line and we
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
spend almost fifty dollars a month on
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
taxes and a large part of this I was
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about this issue before I even
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
saw this bill in New Hampshire and a
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
large part of this is the fact that the
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
federal government has a 12.24 percent
 
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
rate on all Wireless Services it's
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
essentially a sales tax on top of an
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
additional sales tax that's charged on
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
these services and some states have
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
rates that top 20 percent we're talking
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
sales tax rates for for wireless service
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
that is almost 35 percent in some states
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire has a relatively low
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
rate here but this is an opportunity for
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to become what I believe
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
is the first state to get rid of this
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
tax entirely and also take another step
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
towards making New Hampshire a true no
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
sales tax state it's a sort of a lot
 
01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
like the interest in dividends tax is
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
the the one thing holding New Hampshire
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
back from from being a true no income
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
tax state the wireless tax is definitely
 
01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
a type of sales tax and it's sort of a
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
workaround in the absence of an actual
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
state tax that most people don't
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
recognize until they're forced to really
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
confront it for themselves and a lot of
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
these costs are also embedded into the
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
wireless service so I believe that this
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
would be it doesn't make New Hampshire
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
sort of a model for other states
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
particularly a lot of Republican states
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
even Nebraska has a rate of 19.49
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
percent combined state and local for
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
their Wireless taxes and if we did this
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I believe quite a
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
few other
 
01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.610 align:start position:0%
few other
um

01:15:51.610 --> 01:15:51.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
reform-minded States would follow suit
 
01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire would get the credit
 
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
for being the first to take this action
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't have much else to say but I
 
01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
think that this is a meaningful reform
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
that really wouldn't have that large of
 
01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
an impact on state revenue and would
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
also simplify the tax code and make New
 
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a true no sales tax state so
 
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
that's all I have thank you and for the
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
members uh knowledge our rate right now
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
for the communication Services tax is
 
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
seven percent so you know a
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
representative Albany has a question
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
would you be open to questions
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you uh in the last hearing you
 
01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
said that preferably we should be using
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
sales and property taxes so why should
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
we go after a sales tax now I do think
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
with a couple hundred million of dollars
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
in the bank
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
um reducing reducing spending overall
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
and using these surplus funds on uh
 
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
relief for ordinary people in New
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make the economy and the
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
state overall more competitive is really
 
01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
a striking contrast to States like
 
01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
California to name one extreme example
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
which used more than 100 billion dollars
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
worth of Surplus on new programs that
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
they knew that they couldn't fund and
 
01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:03.659 align:start position:0%
they're already facing a shortfall for
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
this year the fact that New Hampshire
 
01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:08.900 align:start position:0%
does not have a sales tax is admirable
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
there are other sources of government
 
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
revenue that have given the state a
 
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
booming and booming economy and a pretty
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
massive Surplus until the state does run
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
into problems with the way the tax is
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
structured eliminating taxes wherever we
 
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
can or at least lowering the rates is
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
preferable to using this money on
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
whatever new programs could be thought
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
of or invented other states have proven
 
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
that there is no end or limit to the
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
amount of things the government can and
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
will spend money on depending on which
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
special interest groups have the most
 
01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.370 align:start position:0%
special interest groups have the most
power

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:41.149 align:start position:0%
power
um

01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a very small impact
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
and isn't necessarily a sales tax but it
 
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
is a workaround that would be better to
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
okay we will now recognize Catherine
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
Longhead again from tax Foundation thank
 
01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:18.350 align:start position:0%
Longhead again from tax Foundation thank
you

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and members of the committee
 
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the chance to
 
01:18:23.689 --> 01:18:23.699 align:start position:0%
testify again my name is Catherine
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
lawhead with the tax foundation and we
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
do not take a position on legislation
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
but it's good to share some information
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
with you about the communication
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
Services tax
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
as you know houseboat 133 would repeal
 
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
the attacks effective July 1st 2023
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
now currently New Hampshire levisa
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
communication Services taxed at a rate
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
of seven percent in addition to a
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
separate 9-1-1 tax of 75 cents per
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
transaction so this yields a combined
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
state tax of approximately 9.1 percent
 
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
on the non-data portion of a New
 
01:18:59.570 --> 01:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident's cell phone bill
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
this is actually well below the national
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
average so this isn't necessarily A
 
01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:05.540 align:start position:0%
competitiveness issue for New Hampshire
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
but because there's actually little
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
economic justification for wireless
 
01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
Services taxes to begin with reducing or
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
even eliminating this tax could be worth
 
01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.570 align:start position:0%
even eliminating this tax could be worth
considering

01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
considering
 
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
while the federal government and all 50
 
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
states do Levy some form of Wireless
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
Services tax this is not necessarily
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
something that makes a whole lot of
 
01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
sense because ideally when States Levy
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
excise taxes on specific goods or
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
services or activities those taxes
 
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
should either function as a type of user
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
fee or they should seek to recoup the
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
negative externalities associated with
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
that activity or try to pay for programs
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
that help address the cost to society
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
created by that activity
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
as an example gas taxes and Highway
 
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
tolls are like user fees in that
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the people who are
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
paying the most in those taxes are the
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
ones who are contributing most to the
 
01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:02.219 align:start position:0%
wear and tear on the roads and can most
 
01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:05.219 align:start position:0%
benefit from funding for Road upkeep
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
meanwhile excise taxes on things like
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol should ideally only generate
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue to be used to mitigate the
 
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
negative externalities associated with
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol use disorder or with drunk
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
driving and things like that
 
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
now a lot of States go above this and
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
try to Target these taxes
 
01:20:29.649 --> 01:20:29.659 align:start position:0%
and raise taxes on these activities to
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
just raise General Revenue for the state
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
and this is sort of what is occurring
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
here with the wireless Services tax
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
because when it's added onto your cell
 
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
phone bill oftentimes you know you have
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
a number of line items on your bill and
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
you don't know exactly what they're
 
01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
going toward you just pay what you're
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
being asked to pay and you know might be
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
annoyed but not think much of it besides
 
01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
that wireless taxes however are unlike
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
both gas taxes or alcohol taxes and that
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
they are mostly just a revenue generator
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
for the general fund they're not a type
 
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
of user fee and they aren't trying to
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
recoup some sort of negative externality
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
because I think we can all agree that in
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
general cell phone use is
 
01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:18.620 align:start position:0%
um creating a net benefit for society
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
and that there's not really a negative
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
externality that we should be trying to
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
mitigate here
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
so again in Most states Wireless taxes
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
are generally just another source of
 
01:21:32.689 --> 01:21:32.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue even to the extent that the 911
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
Tax that's separate from the
 
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax but to the
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
extent that that tax is being used to
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
pay for 9-1-1 Services there's a little
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
economic justification for imposing that
 
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
on the cell phone bill
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh because how much a consumer pays for
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
their cell phone service has no relation
 
01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
to how much they are likely to rely on
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 or 988 Services
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
um now 98 911 and 988 services are broad
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
services that are available to the
 
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
public broadly so they should be
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
considered General publicly provided
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
Goods that are funded through the
 
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
general fund through broad-based taxes
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
I will also add to this that wireless
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
Services taxes are regressive in that as
 
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
a percentage of income the taxes impose
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
higher tax burdens on lower income
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers than on higher income
 
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:24.830 align:start position:0%
taxpayers than on higher income
taxpayers

01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
so policy makers should ideally avoid
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
increasing the communication Services
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
tax to excessively high levels I would
 
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
steer clear of what other states have
 
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
done in imposing rates as high or even
 
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
higher than 20 percent especially
 
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
because these taxes do not meaningfully
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
internalize any kind of external harm
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to answer any
 
01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:50.030 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative roachford
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the wireless services
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
are regressive uh and negatively impact
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
lower income taxpayers so understanding
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
this tax and how it's assessed and onto
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
what services it says do are when you go
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
to Walmart and you buy these single-use
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
phones the TracFones or whatever do do
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
are those taxed as well
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
I do believe the tax applies to all
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
two-way communication services so my
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is that yes it would apply
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
to that as well
 
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay we now have the folks from the uh
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
dra who are here to answer any questions
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Keen Wong and Lauren
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
good morning Representatives my name is
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
Kim Ming Wong from the Department of
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration
 
01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
my name is Lauren O'Sullivan also from
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
I've just passed around a fiscal no
 
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
quick guide in regards to the fiscal
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
note that we prepared for the uh for
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:44.780 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll
 
01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
the department does not have a position
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
on this bill and we're here to answer
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
okay hopefully you have seen this quick
 
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
representation has a question
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
um do we know how what the amount of out
 
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
of that 30 million is the um 911
 
01:25:24.179 --> 01:25:26.450 align:start position:0%
of that 30 million is the um 911
portion

01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
portion
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
this does not include the 9-1-1 that's
 
01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:29.990 align:start position:0%
this does not include the 9-1-1 that's
separate

01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:25:41.810 --> 01:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I I don't understand why that why
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's going down why the revenue is going
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
down I mean it seems to me you know data
 
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
services cell phones that there's even
 
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
just more and more of them why is it the
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
rate going down
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
yes we did uh notice that the uh the
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
rate uh the revenue from the revenue
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
from CSD has gone down and um and
 
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
we do see that it is likely because of
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
the way the uh Communication service
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
providers are building their customers
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
the way that they're bifurcating the the
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
charges as opposed to data versus voice
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
data is something that's not subject to
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax whereas The
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
Voice portion of the bill will be
 
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
subject to the CST and uh when in this
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
when the service providers say um that
 
01:26:37.199 --> 01:26:38.450 align:start position:0%
when the service providers say um that
okay

01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
based on however their method of billing
 
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
or they're providing the service to say
 
01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.209 align:start position:0%
or they're providing the service to say
okay

01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:44.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
a majority of our service is more for
 
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
data than as a smaller portion of the
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
bill is then relative to the voice piece
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
and therefore subject to cscop over
 
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
um so you know if maybe if there's an
 
01:27:01.139 --> 01:27:02.270 align:start position:0%
um so you know if maybe if there's an
example

01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking one of the things that
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
that happened during covet is people
 
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
started using Zoom you know and that
 
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
they're communicating they're
 
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
communicating verbally is that is that
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
but if they're doing it on their
 
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
computer they're not not getting taxed
 
01:27:26.209 --> 01:27:26.219 align:start position:0%
for that because it goes over the
 
01:27:28.729 --> 01:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
Internet or so two-way all two-way
 
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
Communications will be subject to the
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
CST so including providers like Zoom so
 
01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:35.219 align:start position:0%
any kind of two-way communication from
 
01:27:35.219 --> 01:27:37.070 align:start position:0%
any kind of two-way communication from
Zoom

01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
Zoom
 
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
um with a video or through the telephone
 
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.689 --> 01:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
maybe we could ask someone from the
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
communications providers to help us with
 
01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
that to help us understand that okay
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ames
 
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
just just pursuing this question
 
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
um is there a standard that uh that
 
01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:14.219 align:start position:0%
could help both the providers and The
 
01:28:14.219 --> 01:28:15.590 align:start position:0%
could help both the providers and The
Regulators

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
Regulators
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
sort between that which is subject to
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
this text and that which is not I mean
 
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
they they're separating out
 
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
a piece the uh the provider that
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
provides us with the service on our cell
 
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
phones is separating out a piece of that
 
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
that is I guess data you call it
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
something like that and the and the
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
voice and um
 
01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
um and their their tendency in recent
 
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
years has been to push more of that into
 
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
the data the non-taxable piece as far as
 
01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
this tax is concerned
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh what limits are there
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
to that what is what is the standard
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
that applies to being in this cubby hole
 
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
I would say that um that currently is a
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
function of our audit process I do know
 
01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:29:18.890 --> 01:29:18.900 align:start position:0%
we we do have CST audits our audit
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
department at the dra do perform CST
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
Audits and as part of that function we
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
do review
 
01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:29.060 align:start position:0%
um as to um
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
what exactly would be the uh the the
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
two-way Communication Service piece
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and then everything else will then
 
01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
fall back to the statute will be just uh
 
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
follow what's presents required by the
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
statute in terms of what is a two-way
 
01:29:48.169 --> 01:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
communication and what is uh providing
 
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
follow up on the last two
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
my interpretation of this is that the
 
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
the VoIP the voiceover Internet Protocol
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
people were not being charged this tax
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
could we get information on the revenue
 
01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.290 align:start position:0%
could we get information on the revenue
from

01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
people like zoom and other VoIP
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
providers to see if they are paying this
 
01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.090 align:start position:0%
providers to see if they are paying this
tax

01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
so you wish to see the um the CSD
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
revenue from these uh VoIP providers yes
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
because I too if if indeed they are
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
subject to this tax I guess I'm curious
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
why the revenue isn't going up
 
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
especially given how much we use those
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
Services since the pandemic um I'm not
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
sure we're able to disclose that that
 
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
sort of information are specific to any
 
01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
provider because can you provide it as a
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
lump as all VoIP people we'll have to
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
depend on the amount of VoIP providers
 
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
if in the market and within the CST
 
01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:06.590 align:start position:0%
if in the market and within the CST
Market

01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire if the number of
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
providers is is a very small amount
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
um it will be uh you will not be able to
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
disclose uh specific information
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
in regards to that so but we will look
 
01:31:22.370 --> 01:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
into that and see if we can provide that
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
again this I'm new to Ways and Means so
 
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
this might be a question I should know
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
the answer to but
 
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:37.790 align:start position:0%
the answer to but
um

01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'm also wondering
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
how we tax if the service is delivered
 
01:31:44.689 --> 01:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire right if I'm consuming
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
Zoom here in New Hampshire and they
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have headquarters here
 
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
maybe the taxes are different because of
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
that as well so I guess I'm just curious
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
if we're capturing or if we're trying to
 
01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
capture a tax on that
 
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
so the CST tax is a tax that would be
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
paid by the consumer and collected by
 
01:32:12.129 --> 01:32:12.139 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
so if I'm not mistaken the uh the
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
location of the provider would not
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
determine whether the
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
service is subject to cstni so it's the
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
consumer so I should be able to look at
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
my own
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
Zoom Bill and see this tax listed on
 
01:32:34.810 --> 01:32:34.820 align:start position:0%
them I believe it's
 
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
based on the mailing address of the end
 
01:32:40.129 --> 01:32:40.139 align:start position:0%
user so for example I have someone from
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
New York on my family plan and they're
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
subject to the New Hampshire tax is not
 
01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
the New York State and New York City
 
01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:46.729 align:start position:0%
the New York State and New York City
taxes

01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:32:51.490 --> 01:32:51.500 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh rajford
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
was speaking earlier about the track
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
phones the people who are on track
 
01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
phones and the people who are on real
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
landlines is versus mine which is run by
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
Comcast cable uh
 
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
are still I believe paying the full
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
seven percent of the cost
 
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
of the real of the real price of the
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
product whereas the people on
 
01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.870 align:start position:0%
product whereas the people on
cable

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
cable
 
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
and the people who are on I don't know
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
how they would
 
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh anyway on the people who are on cable
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
and other forms of uh VoIP or whatever
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
on would be paying whatever the company
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
manages to convince you is the cost of
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
Just The Voice
 
01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
and my phone bills have gone down quite
 
01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
a lot in terms of calls because on they
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
convinced you or you hadn't done audits
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
of them of that on the costs per call is
 
01:34:13.689 --> 01:34:13.699 align:start position:0%
a lot less than what it used to be
 
01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
so which may be true I'm not sure
 
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
um but my zoom Bill consists of I'm
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
foolishly perhaps because I'm not using
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
it paying 150 a year for a license
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody gets
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
a zoom bill
 
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
who isn't paying for a license is there
 
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
a question the question is does that
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
um I do know that the customers for
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
track for those uh prepaid
 
01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.189 align:start position:0%
track for those uh prepaid
um

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
calling services they do they do uh also
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
subject to the CST And in regards to
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
um the the cable providers and um how
 
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
they are allocating the costs to the the
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh The Voice phone services that they
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
provide versus all the other services
 
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not aware of of that the trend
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
that's happening right now with those
 
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
with those cable companies
 
01:35:28.129 --> 01:35:28.139 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks for taking
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
my question I'm curious as to the
 
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
history of the CST tax how long ago was
 
01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:40.850 align:start position:0%
history of the CST tax how long ago was
implemented

01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
that information is in the annual report
 
01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.290 align:start position:0%
that information is in the annual report
okay

01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
um we don't have that information right
 
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think we'll find it in the tech in the
 
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
on dra historical records but it it goes
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
back to a time when we got rid of a
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of troublesome little taxes
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
and this is one of the ones they put in
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
instead follow-up so it looks like we
 
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
have some follow-up questions for you on
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
this so anything you find out could you
 
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
please email all the committee members
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like maybe I'll reach out
 
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
to some of the service providers and see
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
if they can shed any light or their
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this but there's not a lot
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
of these service providers so that's why
 
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to give too much
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
detail because then you might be able to
 
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
figure out who those are I understand
 
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
that but maybe they can at least explain
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
their thoughts on Zoom versus VoIP and
 
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
all this other stuff yes representative
 
01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:40.669 align:start position:0%
all this other stuff yes representative
ulrey

01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
ulrey
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
yeah Madam chair I believe the concept
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
of a tax on Communications goes back to
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
the Spanish-American War when only the
 
01:36:51.649 --> 01:36:51.659 align:start position:0%
rich had telephones
 
01:36:54.129 --> 01:36:54.139 align:start position:0%
is there a question there though
 
01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
oh that was to me okay
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
I will not answer that question
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative you said just uh
 
01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
the follow-up the the point I wanted to
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
get to was the his his history in this I
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
know for one and others have brought up
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
my cell phone bill for instance as
 
01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
opposed to a landline bill was
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
substantially higher back a few years
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
ago so my
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
guess is the tax in Revenue was
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
substantially higher so I'd like to see
 
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
what those rates were maybe back eight
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
years ago and where we are now okay and
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh 30 30.9 million
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
and and what the revenue was at its at
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
its peak and where we are right now in
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I I don't know if
 
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
this would be helpful or not but this is
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
not a question but like I brought in my
 
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
tax bill I'm in my my phone bill which
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
is a lamp real landline so if other
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
people could
 
01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
bring in their bills and maybe we could
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
get some better idea of like who's
 
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
getting taxed and how much
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
represent Ames
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
just I happen to have my computer open I
 
01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
think I was doing the right kind of
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
thing with it I wasn't doodling
 
01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:15.890 align:start position:0%
thing with it I wasn't doodling
um

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
this tax was first enacted in 1990 this
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
is the dra annual report that's a
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
blurbed there that lays it all out at
 
01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
5.5 percent that's where it started and
 
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
then uh there was a surtax that was put
 
01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
on it in 2001 that added 2.5 so that
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
brings it up to seven percent which is
 
01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
where we are now
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
and then uh there was this question of
 
01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
two-way communication Services which way
 
01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
back then wasn't a question you know you
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
just had your telephones but uh the
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
complications that we're talking about
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
are more recent and I don't know whether
 
01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:55.850 align:start position:0%
are more recent and I don't know whether
there's

01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
any added language that helps us figure
 
01:39:02.209 --> 01:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
out get the question I asked how do you
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
differentiate between what's taxable and
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
what's not so I look forward to getting
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%

foreign

03:06:13.969 --> 03:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:06:19.849 --> 03:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:22.250 --> 03:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
we will now open the public hearing on
 
03:06:25.010 --> 03:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 192 and recognize
 
03:06:26.690 --> 03:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
03:06:29.450 --> 03:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:06:31.130 --> 03:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
um oh and I should I just for the record
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
I do pay this tax as well and so do I
 
03:06:37.610 --> 03:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
okay I put that disclaimer at the end of
 
03:06:37.620 --> 03:06:39.590 align:start position:0%
okay I put that disclaimer at the end of
this

03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:06:39.600 --> 03:06:40.790 align:start position:0%
this
um

03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:40.800 --> 03:06:42.110 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:06:42.110 --> 03:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
the first sentence at this point was on
 
03:06:48.050 --> 03:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
is changed by what the governor said
 
03:06:50.269 --> 03:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
this morning which is oh I'm feeling
 
03:06:53.690 --> 03:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
much better about our our revenues at
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
this point and I think that we can
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
probably cut some taxes he wants tax
 
03:07:00.889 --> 03:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
credits as well I haven't seen a tax
 
03:07:05.090 --> 03:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
credit yet but that's what he wants
 
03:07:05.100 --> 03:07:07.070 align:start position:0%
credit yet but that's what he wants
um

03:07:07.070 --> 03:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
but it is still true that we need to be
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
very careful with our budgeting this
 
03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:14.809 align:start position:0%
very careful with our budgeting this
year

03:07:14.809 --> 03:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:07:17.210 --> 03:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
we are just exiting from under the
 
03:07:19.969 --> 03:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
largest bucket of stimulus money ever to
 
03:07:21.950 --> 03:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
be dropped on our state and National
 
03:07:21.960 --> 03:07:23.389 align:start position:0%
be dropped on our state and National
economies

03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
economies
 
03:07:25.250 --> 03:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how well our
 
03:07:27.290 --> 03:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
businesses and residents Will Survive
 
03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
Beyond it
 
03:07:31.790 --> 03:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
we have major unmet needs to maintain
 
03:07:34.490 --> 03:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
our economy lack of housing for all
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
levels of workers High property taxes
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
affecting most workers
 
03:07:43.130 --> 03:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
child and elder care costs
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
workers access to Medical Care addiction
 
03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
and mental health treatment public
 
03:07:50.950 --> 03:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
transit and Road and Bridge maintenance
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
and a bunch of other things
 
03:07:56.330 --> 03:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
and on top of that on New Hampshire's
 
03:07:59.389 --> 03:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
voluntary social service agencies do a
 
03:08:01.849 --> 03:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
lot of the government's work that is
 
03:08:03.550 --> 03:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
done in other states by the government
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
for the Working Poor and disadvantaged
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
and when there is less state revenue
 
03:08:12.889 --> 03:08:12.899 align:start position:0%
their reimbursements have been left in
 
03:08:16.450 --> 03:08:16.460 align:start position:0%
the past several times in my time here
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
at pre-inflation rates for years and
 
03:08:22.610 --> 03:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
paid late or never
 
03:08:25.610 --> 03:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
in order to balance a budget
 
03:08:31.309 --> 03:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
and we lost in Lebanon the only
 
03:08:31.319 --> 03:08:32.090 align:start position:0%
and we lost in Lebanon the only
um

03:08:32.090 --> 03:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
home for unwed soon-to-be mothers that
 
03:08:40.130 --> 03:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
took them through the coming mothers and
 
03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
getting stable and sent them out into
 
03:08:45.650 --> 03:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
the community and took their children
 
03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
and as for child care and such and made
 
03:08:52.910 --> 03:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
them productive citizens and that was
 
03:08:55.250 --> 03:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
because they dared to sue the state
 
03:08:58.490 --> 03:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
because they had been paid never for six
 
03:08:58.500 --> 03:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
because they had been paid never for six
months

03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:09:02.269 --> 03:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
for the reimbursements they were
 
03:09:04.450 --> 03:09:04.460 align:start position:0%
supposed to get
 
03:09:06.769 --> 03:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
there were five other agencies around
 
03:09:08.450 --> 03:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
the state that the same thing happened
 
03:09:11.230 --> 03:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
to I don't know if they all died
 
03:09:13.969 --> 03:09:13.979 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire requires more investment
 
03:09:15.469 --> 03:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
not less
 
03:09:19.250 --> 03:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
but since 2016 the solution has been to
 
03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
cut state level taxes and make it
 
03:09:25.070 --> 03:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
impossible to invest to grow and thrive
 
03:09:27.769 --> 03:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
every year the business LED Council on
 
03:09:30.410 --> 03:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
state taxations has calculated the tax
 
03:09:32.570 --> 03:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
and fee burden to each State's
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
businesses each year they have reported
 
03:09:37.070 --> 03:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire the corporate
 
03:09:39.469 --> 03:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
income tax which they equate with both
 
03:09:41.469 --> 03:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
BPT and bet
 
03:09:44.330 --> 03:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
represents less than two-thirds what the
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
average business pays in property taxes
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
we are our businesses our normal our
 
03:09:53.870 --> 03:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
average businesses are paying more in
 
03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
property taxes than they are in uh
 
03:09:59.809 --> 03:09:59.819 align:start position:0%
profit taxes
 
03:10:01.790 --> 03:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:10:05.269 --> 03:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
um obviously differs if you've got a
 
03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
small office handling a huge amount of
 
03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:10.070 align:start position:0%
small office handling a huge amount of
transactions

03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
03:10:14.210 --> 03:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
than if you've got a Walmart but
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
um we have been cutting State business
 
03:10:19.849 --> 03:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
taxes not the property taxes the efforts
 
03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
at reducing the property tax have been
 
03:10:24.410 --> 03:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
one time and are usually biased towards
 
03:10:26.690 --> 03:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
helping the wealthiest communities not
 
03:10:30.230 --> 03:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
where most businesses are located
 
03:10:33.230 --> 03:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
we have a very old requirement in our
 
03:10:35.630 --> 03:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
laws that municipalities are the place
 
03:10:38.269 --> 03:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
of Last Resort for the Indigent and have
 
03:10:39.650 --> 03:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
to help them
 
03:10:42.889 --> 03:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
every time the state faces a deficit the
 
03:10:44.690 --> 03:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
governor of the time starts to cut
 
03:10:47.929 --> 03:10:47.939 align:start position:0%
school or Municipal Aid or programs that
 
03:10:50.090 --> 03:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
the municipalities cannot afford to lose
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
such as support to the homeless and to
 
03:10:54.170 --> 03:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
the hungry
 
03:10:59.150 --> 03:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
even without a recession in 2023 to 4
 
03:11:01.849 --> 03:11:01.859 align:start position:0%
revenues are likely to decline somewhat
 
03:11:03.950 --> 03:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
this year from the peak created by the
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
federal stimulus and to drop sharply in
 
03:11:10.370 --> 03:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
2024. the business taxes including the
 
03:11:12.769 --> 03:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
IND tax are the key part of this problem
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
there are three-sevenths of all General
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
and education trust revenue and that is
 
03:11:22.250 --> 03:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
after years of cuts
 
03:11:24.889 --> 03:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
and they are the most volatile
 
03:11:27.530 --> 03:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
they made up 61 percent of our Surplus
 
03:11:29.690 --> 03:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
in the first six months of this fiscal
 
03:11:29.700 --> 03:11:33.170 align:start position:0%
in the first six months of this fiscal
year

03:11:33.170 --> 03:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:36.170 --> 03:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
our interest in dividends tax seems that
 
03:11:38.870 --> 03:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
revenues seem to be dropping
 
03:11:42.370 --> 03:11:42.380 align:start position:0%
we won't really know until April May
 
03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the BET has been flirting with
 
03:11:47.630 --> 03:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
coming in below the plan that this
 
03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
committee estimated in early 2021 when
 
03:11:54.530 --> 03:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
the clouds of recession seemed near
 
03:11:57.230 --> 03:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
the stock market has been declining as
 
03:12:00.110 --> 03:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
the federal stimulus Pat packages end
 
03:12:03.170 --> 03:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
and the war on Ukraine continues and
 
03:12:06.170 --> 03:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
most economists expect a recession
 
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
though some of them are peddling back to
 
03:12:11.630 --> 03:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
a softer session or a slow session or
 
03:12:14.090 --> 03:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
some such word
 
03:12:16.429 --> 03:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
um those do hit
 
03:12:19.490 --> 03:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
the smallest businesses worst the slow
 
03:12:19.500 --> 03:12:22.130 align:start position:0%
the smallest businesses worst the slow
recessions

03:12:22.130 --> 03:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
recessions
 
03:12:22.140 --> 03:12:24.410 align:start position:0%
recessions
on

03:12:24.410 --> 03:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:12:24.420 --> 03:12:26.570 align:start position:0%
on
why

03:12:26.570 --> 03:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:12:30.769 --> 03:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
are these dropping we cut bptbt rates
 
03:12:34.730 --> 03:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
multiple times starting in 16. in 19 and
 
03:12:38.710 --> 03:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
21 we made structural changes to the BPT
 
03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing single sales
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
factor and credit carry forward
 
03:12:47.929 --> 03:12:47.939 align:start position:0%
depletion these were all made
 
03:12:47.939 --> 03:12:48.950 align:start position:0%
depletion these were all made
um

03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:51.469 --> 03:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
well I'll go into that in a minute and
 
03:12:54.530 --> 03:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
and the interest in dividends rate
 
03:12:54.540 --> 03:12:55.969 align:start position:0%
and the interest in dividends rate
changes

03:12:55.969 --> 03:12:55.979 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
will cost us at least 100 million
 
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
relative to the 2019 Baseline starting
 
03:13:05.630 --> 03:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
in 2024 and working their way up under
 
03:13:07.870 --> 03:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
current law or happening immediately
 
03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
next year
 
03:13:10.200 --> 03:13:11.809 align:start position:0%
next year
on

03:13:11.809 --> 03:13:11.819 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:13:14.450 --> 03:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say the market-based
 
03:13:18.170 --> 03:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
sourcing was something that seems to be
 
03:13:19.309 --> 03:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
working out
 
03:13:23.690 --> 03:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
on it changed the basis of what is taxed
 
03:13:27.469 --> 03:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
in intangibles in on
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
03:13:29.279 --> 03:13:31.250 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
and

03:13:31.250 --> 03:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:34.370 --> 03:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
it's going and we seem to be able to
 
03:13:38.330 --> 03:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
find as many places that on outside the
 
03:13:42.170 --> 03:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
state that weren't paying for them as we
 
03:13:43.550 --> 03:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
were losing
 
03:13:46.429 --> 03:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
to other states because they were being
 
03:13:51.230 --> 03:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
sold to Massachusetts and further south
 
03:13:55.389 --> 03:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
on the single sales factor is another
 
03:13:59.570 --> 03:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
and extremely difficult thing to measure
 
03:14:01.630 --> 03:14:01.640 align:start position:0%
we're just going to have to wait until
 
03:14:06.590 --> 03:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
2024 and 2025 to see what happened to us
 
03:14:12.290 --> 03:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
but it is based on the idea that the
 
03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
BPT is only
 
03:14:20.990 --> 03:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
only taxes sales inside the state
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
on if we a lot of our business of our
 
03:14:29.290 --> 03:14:29.300 align:start position:0%
manufacturing businesses they produce
 
03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
widgets and fancy machines and all sorts
 
03:14:37.490 --> 03:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
of stuff on using a little bit of
 
03:14:40.070 --> 03:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
imports from outside the state that they
 
03:14:42.130 --> 03:14:42.140 align:start position:0%
buy inside the state
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
but they then send them back out of the
 
03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:47.750 align:start position:0%
but they then send them back out of the
state

03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
across the country and across the world
 
03:14:54.950 --> 03:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
and those we will not be able to tax
 
03:14:59.389 --> 03:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
from the outside there are things that
 
03:15:02.510 --> 03:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
that businesses outside are going to be
 
03:15:04.370 --> 03:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
selling us
 
03:15:07.070 --> 03:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
that we can tax
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
but we are an old we're one of the
 
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
oldest states in the country we don't
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
consume as much as other people
 
03:15:17.690 --> 03:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
and our businesses are not based on
 
03:15:20.510 --> 03:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
bringing a lot of value in to add a
 
03:15:23.870 --> 03:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:23.880 --> 03:15:25.250 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:15:25.250 --> 03:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
it looks quite
 
03:15:30.590 --> 03:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
possible that we could end up with a
 
03:15:33.530 --> 03:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
very unpleasant surprise in 24.
 
03:15:36.889 --> 03:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
or 25 I'm not sure how long it takes for
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
this to activate
 
03:15:39.120 --> 03:15:40.070 align:start position:0%
this to activate
um

03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:44.030 --> 03:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
but it is based it is it started this
 
03:15:51.410 --> 03:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.010 --> 03:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the dra has been trying to find the
 
03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
businesses that are outside the state
 
03:15:59.450 --> 03:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
that we'll be selling in
 
03:15:59.460 --> 03:16:01.130 align:start position:0%
that we'll be selling in
so

03:16:01.130 --> 03:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:01.140 --> 03:16:02.809 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:16:02.809 --> 03:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:07.309 --> 03:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
the committee last term and the term
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
before fought bitterly and bipartisanly
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
against single sales Factor
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
we were trying to keep it from occurring
 
03:16:24.070 --> 03:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
until we've had enough years of multi
 
03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing that we can get
 
03:16:28.610 --> 03:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
some kind of idea of what this is going
 
03:16:29.870 --> 03:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
to do to us
 
03:16:32.809 --> 03:16:32.819 align:start position:0%
but both the governor and the Senate
 
03:16:35.929 --> 03:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it and we couldn't get a
 
03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
budget without it in 2019.
 
03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:41.330 align:start position:0%
budget without it in 2019.
so

03:16:41.330 --> 03:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:43.730 --> 03:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
um then the last one is credit carry
 
03:16:45.710 --> 03:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
forward depletion
 
03:16:50.210 --> 03:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
that was a bug of air of Representative
 
03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
Majors which the rest of us I think came
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
to appreciate a lot more as it grew it's
 
03:17:01.610 --> 03:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
up above 300 million dollars sitting in
 
03:17:06.349 --> 03:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
the treasury which it we owe to the
 
03:17:09.950 --> 03:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
companies that did not uh
 
03:17:13.550 --> 03:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
remove their overpayments from
 
03:17:15.769 --> 03:17:15.779 align:start position:0%
the treasury
 
03:17:19.309 --> 03:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
so for whatever reason and we had a
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
number of thoughts about it on they were
 
03:17:22.969 --> 03:17:22.979 align:start position:0%
leaving it there
 
03:17:26.570 --> 03:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
we have the possibility that in a bad
 
03:17:26.580 --> 03:17:28.190 align:start position:0%
we have the possibility that in a bad
recession

03:17:28.190 --> 03:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
recession
 
03:17:31.070 --> 03:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
companies could come to the treasury and
 
03:17:34.010 --> 03:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
say I want my piece of that 300 million
 
03:17:34.020 --> 03:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
say I want my piece of that 300 million
back

03:17:35.990 --> 03:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:17:41.210 --> 03:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
and so we finally last term put into the
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
budget bipartisanly uh a very carefully
 
03:17:49.550 --> 03:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
calculated reduction in that over a
 
03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
period of years in which the real damage
 
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
or benefit comes in
 
03:17:59.150 --> 03:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
the fifth and sixth year I think giving
 
03:18:01.730 --> 03:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
enough time for the finance committee to
 
03:18:03.769 --> 03:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
panic and say you're taking away too
 
03:18:06.650 --> 03:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
much money we can't do this any longer
 
03:18:06.660 --> 03:18:08.389 align:start position:0%
much money we can't do this any longer
so

03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
um the federal stimulus has hidden these
 
03:18:14.690 --> 03:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
effects of of the structural changes and
 
03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
the rate changes first the Trump era tax
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
cuts and job acts jobs act resulted in
 
03:18:22.870 --> 03:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
large profits
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
for the largest copper corporations as
 
03:18:29.450 --> 03:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
they took back the tax cuts that had
 
03:18:30.849 --> 03:18:30.859 align:start position:0%
been repealed
 
03:18:37.010 --> 03:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
by that bill on we paid we they then had
 
03:18:41.809 --> 03:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
to pay us on taxes business taxes
 
03:18:46.130 --> 03:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
business profits taxes that is on the
 
03:18:48.170 --> 03:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
extra profits that they'd gotten from
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
03:18:49.680 --> 03:18:51.410 align:start position:0%
the federal government
uh

03:18:51.410 --> 03:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:54.650 --> 03:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
then came the Trump error cares act and
 
03:18:56.929 --> 03:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
then a sequence of Biden narrow stimulus
 
03:19:00.050 --> 03:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
bills to reinvest in America as we
 
03:19:01.969 --> 03:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
survived the pandemic
 
03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
they caused inflation but they kept
 
03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
households and businesses alive and
 
03:19:09.530 --> 03:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
paying taxes and
 
03:19:12.650 --> 03:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
paying taxes to us as well
 
03:19:15.410 --> 03:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
now as the stimulus bills narrow to a
 
03:19:18.050 --> 03:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
few areas of focus and District of
 
03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
Columbia won't be coming to rescue us is
 
03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
not the time to be cutting the state's
 
03:19:25.790 --> 03:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
revenues when we have no idea what
 
03:19:29.389 --> 03:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
stability is going to look like
 
03:19:34.670 --> 03:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
HB 192 revives the IND tax at its
 
03:19:37.370 --> 03:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
long-standing rate of five percent but
 
03:19:39.650 --> 03:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
updates the exemptions which have been
 
03:19:43.070 --> 03:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
frozen in place since 1977.
 
03:19:45.830 --> 03:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people paying them
 
03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
who are lower middle income some even
 
03:19:52.190 --> 03:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
low income that
 
03:19:52.200 --> 03:19:53.330 align:start position:0%
low income that
um

03:19:53.330 --> 03:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:56.030 --> 03:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
that really shouldn't be paying them
 
03:19:56.040 --> 03:19:57.530 align:start position:0%
that really shouldn't be paying them
anymore

03:19:57.530 --> 03:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:19:57.540 --> 03:19:59.990 align:start position:0%
anymore
and

03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people who have been filing
 
03:20:06.110 --> 03:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
return which comes out as zero which is
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
why we already did this kind of of
 
03:20:13.130 --> 03:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
increase in the floor for the BET and
 
03:20:16.730 --> 03:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
the BPT to get rid of all these filers
 
03:20:19.210 --> 03:20:19.220 align:start position:0%
who had zero
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
zero payments to make
 
03:20:25.849 --> 03:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
my estimate is that removing these
 
03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
people would cost us about 5 million a
 
03:20:30.889 --> 03:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
year it's based on the dra's inverted
 
03:20:33.889 --> 03:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
triangles but tries to account for the
 
03:20:36.370 --> 03:20:36.380 align:start position:0%
joint filers and multiple Exempted
 
03:20:39.769 --> 03:20:39.779 align:start position:0%
filers by a total guesstimate on my part
 
03:20:42.110 --> 03:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
I'd hope the dra would have slightly
 
03:20:44.330 --> 03:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
better methodology for this than I
 
03:20:47.269 --> 03:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
probably not yet but maybe if we asked
 
03:20:49.130 --> 03:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
them to try
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
but but my bill leaves about 95 percent
 
03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
of the tax available to a straight
 
03:20:57.710 --> 03:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
treasury that may be severely tried in
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and Beyond if we do not
 
03:21:03.290 --> 03:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
stop cutting our investments in our
 
03:21:06.650 --> 03:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
current and Future workforces
 
03:21:06.660 --> 03:21:09.050 align:start position:0%
current and Future workforces
and

03:21:09.050 --> 03:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
disclosure I pay this tax please don't
 
03:21:16.849 --> 03:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
would you entertain questions
 
03:21:22.969 --> 03:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:26.090 --> 03:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
very thorough wonderful oh
 
03:21:30.110 --> 03:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:30.120 --> 03:21:31.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:21:31.490 --> 03:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:34.610 --> 03:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
if you can can you um
 
03:21:37.490 --> 03:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
relate the history of the int text when
 
03:21:40.490 --> 03:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
was it roughly when was it started five
 
03:21:43.910 --> 03:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
point when was its rate set at the right
 
03:21:47.809 --> 03:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
before this recent decline uh set on
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so we can have a
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
perspective on this tax I believe it's
 
03:21:53.090 --> 03:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
one of our longest standings yes
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide taxes it is I think it is the
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
longest side the property tax was the
 
03:21:59.520 --> 03:22:00.769 align:start position:0%
longest side the property tax was the
longest

03:22:00.769 --> 03:22:00.779 align:start position:0%
longest
 
03:22:03.250 --> 03:22:03.260 align:start position:0%
and the property tax was originally
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
based on productive property
 
03:22:11.090 --> 03:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
so they charged for the apple core
 
03:22:13.250 --> 03:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
machine in your basement they didn't
 
03:22:15.290 --> 03:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
charge for the house you're living in
 
03:22:15.300 --> 03:22:16.550 align:start position:0%
charge for the house you're living in
otherwise

03:22:16.550 --> 03:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
03:22:19.490 --> 03:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
they charged for the forge they charged
 
03:22:22.250 --> 03:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
for the fact that your apple orchard was
 
03:22:24.830 --> 03:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
doing pretty well versus not very well
 
03:22:25.870 --> 03:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:22:29.450 --> 03:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
and the number of cows you had at one
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
point they actually added your brain
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
they said that if you went to Harvard
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
which I think was the only thing around
 
03:22:43.969 --> 03:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
at the time and then you um had to pay
 
03:22:45.710 --> 03:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:22:48.650 --> 03:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis but it seems to have
 
03:22:51.469 --> 03:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
gone off pretty early I learned that Jim
 
03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of this from Doug Hall who
 
03:22:56.210 --> 03:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
trained us
 
03:22:59.990 --> 03:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
my first couple of years on it was
 
03:23:02.210 --> 03:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
originally a wealth tax
 
03:23:05.889 --> 03:23:05.899 align:start position:0%
it was based on interest and dividends
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
this disbursements business didn't exist
 
03:23:12.830 --> 03:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
in those days but and it was mostly I
 
03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
think Savings in Banks
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
but you didn't save in Banks if you were
 
03:23:20.769 --> 03:23:20.779 align:start position:0%
poor in those days
 
03:23:24.290 --> 03:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
so um it was a wealth tax
 
03:23:27.769 --> 03:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
and it was as
 
03:23:30.110 --> 03:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
most of our taxes were meant to raise
 
03:23:32.269 --> 03:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
enough money that you could keep running
 
03:23:34.849 --> 03:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
the state government
 
03:23:36.889 --> 03:23:36.899 align:start position:0%
so would you be open for another
 
03:23:39.410 --> 03:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
question I'm not yeah I'm not sure about
 
03:23:41.570 --> 03:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
the percentage at that point okay
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative plan tables one and two
 
03:23:47.090 --> 03:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
are those your numbers of dra's numbers
 
03:23:49.849 --> 03:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
tables one and two oh those are dras
 
03:23:49.859 --> 03:23:52.330 align:start position:0%
tables one and two oh those are dras
okay

03:23:52.330 --> 03:23:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:55.429 --> 03:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
right it's their fiscal note
 
03:23:58.389 --> 03:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
when you start with on the back with
 
03:24:02.809 --> 03:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
tables and a table that says estimate
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
zero zero zero zero because we don't
 
03:24:07.849 --> 03:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
have any idea what it really is uh and
 
03:24:09.530 --> 03:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
then gives you some real numbers under
 
03:24:12.650 --> 03:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
it that's a fiscal note
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:19.250 --> 03:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
03:24:21.769 --> 03:24:21.779 align:start position:0%
okay we'll recognize the honorable Gene
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
ditch former senator
 
03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:36.410 align:start position:0%
ditch former senator
Kawana

03:24:36.410 --> 03:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.130 --> 03:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you and good to see you madam
 
03:24:44.690 --> 03:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
chair and others my former constituents
 
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
um my name is Gene dietch
 
03:24:51.710 --> 03:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
and I am here because I feel this is a
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
very important
 
03:24:53.640 --> 03:24:54.410 align:start position:0%
very important
um

03:24:54.410 --> 03:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:59.150 --> 03:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
issue I this is my first time back uh in
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
the last two years or three years
 
03:25:04.010 --> 03:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
so it's uh I felt it was important
 
03:25:07.130 --> 03:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
enough to come through the snow
 
03:25:10.130 --> 03:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
um I've I've also paid the interest in
 
03:25:12.969 --> 03:25:12.979 align:start position:0%
dividends tax every one of the 38 years
 
03:25:15.050 --> 03:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
that I've lived here
 
03:25:19.490 --> 03:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
at least I think so but I oppose well I
 
03:25:22.969 --> 03:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
support HB 192.
 
03:25:25.070 --> 03:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and I think I have something in
 
03:25:27.849 --> 03:25:27.859 align:start position:0%
addition to say in addition to
 
03:25:32.050 --> 03:25:32.060 align:start position:0%
representative almie's uh very extensive
 
03:25:37.010 --> 03:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
description of the fiscal reasons uh
 
03:25:40.250 --> 03:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
where why we might need it but mine is
 
03:25:43.729 --> 03:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
more a description of
 
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
um your constituents needs and balancing
 
03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
the needs of people like myself
 
03:25:54.349 --> 03:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
versus most of the constituents
 
03:25:54.359 --> 03:25:55.309 align:start position:0%
versus most of the constituents
um

03:25:55.309 --> 03:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:59.870 --> 03:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is losing families if you
 
03:26:01.969 --> 03:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
look at the first chart
 
03:26:04.250 --> 03:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
you'll see that according to the Census
 
03:26:09.290 --> 03:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
Bureau we have gained 47 percent uh
 
03:26:12.889 --> 03:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
between 2010 and 2020. our senior
 
03:26:16.809 --> 03:26:16.819 align:start position:0%
population grew by 47 percent which is
 
03:26:19.250 --> 03:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
significantly above the United States as
 
03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
a whole
 
03:26:25.610 --> 03:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
um our working population stayed flat
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
and we lost children
 
03:26:32.110 --> 03:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
especially teens and older children
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
far beyond the level that the rest of
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:42.530 --> 03:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
I have a neighbor who's an award-winning
 
03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
realtor so she has sold some of the most
 
03:26:49.190 --> 03:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
properties uh recently and she told me
 
03:26:52.670 --> 03:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday that almost all her clients
 
03:26:55.849 --> 03:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
are between the ages of 50 and 70.
 
03:26:58.790 --> 03:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
that when she does have someone who a
 
03:27:01.790 --> 03:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
couple who are 30 that they are
 
03:27:01.800 --> 03:27:04.790 align:start position:0%
couple who are 30 that they are
childless

03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:07.010 --> 03:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
this obviously is a problem for the
 
03:27:09.050 --> 03:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
future of our state
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
um if we're going to be a state that
 
03:27:15.769 --> 03:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
makes our uh make us ourselves extremely
 
03:27:19.370 --> 03:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
attractive to affluent retirees
 
03:27:22.490 --> 03:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
um that is going to be difficult for the
 
03:27:24.849 --> 03:27:24.859 align:start position:0%
companies trying to hire
 
03:27:27.229 --> 03:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
and it's something we need to think
 
03:27:27.239 --> 03:27:28.910 align:start position:0%
and it's something we need to think
about

03:27:28.910 --> 03:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:27:31.429 --> 03:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
so why are we losing families well as as
 
03:27:33.889 --> 03:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
representative Olney stated we we put an
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
enormous burden on property taxes even
 
03:27:38.330 --> 03:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
our businesses I'm a three-time business
 
03:27:40.130 --> 03:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
owner myself
 
03:27:42.469 --> 03:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm so I I think like a business
 
03:27:46.130 --> 03:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
person and uh property taxes or the rent
 
03:27:48.349 --> 03:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
paid and the property taxes through the
 
03:27:48.359 --> 03:27:49.490 align:start position:0%
paid and the property taxes through the
rent

03:27:49.490 --> 03:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
rent
 
03:27:53.210 --> 03:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
um are yeah more than what we're paying
 
03:27:55.670 --> 03:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
BP to BBT
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um I believe that these kind and the
 
03:28:01.010 --> 03:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
problem is of course that salaries
 
03:28:03.469 --> 03:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
haven't kept up if if salaries were
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
keeping up with the taxes then we would
 
03:28:06.889 --> 03:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
have no problem
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
um people would be able to afford to
 
03:28:10.429 --> 03:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
live here but they're not
 
03:28:13.790 --> 03:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and they haven't now uh the
 
03:28:17.150 --> 03:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
wealthiest one percent have gained huge
 
03:28:19.309 --> 03:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
amounts of wealth since the pandemic uh
 
03:28:22.030 --> 03:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
the supposedly the
 
03:28:25.849 --> 03:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
161 billionaires around the world have
 
03:28:29.150 --> 03:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
doubled their wealth during a time that
 
03:28:32.690 --> 03:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
um tens of millions of people have slid
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
into poverty this is
 
03:28:38.510 --> 03:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
something for the world to be concerned
 
03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
about but in here in New Hampshire what
 
03:28:43.130 --> 03:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
that means is that for the same
 
03:28:45.950 --> 03:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of wealth half
 
03:28:48.590 --> 03:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
of the people half of our constituents
 
03:28:51.469 --> 03:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
your constituents not mine anymore your
 
03:28:51.479 --> 03:28:52.790 align:start position:0%
your constituents not mine anymore your
constituents

03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
03:28:55.729 --> 03:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
um can buy a 20-piece chicken nugget
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
and the better off ones uh the 40 above
 
03:29:00.120 --> 03:29:01.429 align:start position:0%
and the better off ones uh the 40 above
that

03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:05.269 --> 03:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
um can pay their utility bill
 
03:29:05.279 --> 03:29:05.929 align:start position:0%
um can pay their utility bill
um

03:29:05.929 --> 03:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:09.050 --> 03:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
people like me the top 10 percent can
 
03:29:11.650 --> 03:29:11.660 align:start position:0%
have a two-person vacation in Bermuda
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
the disparity is is large
 
03:29:18.590 --> 03:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
and if you turn on the back it shows you
 
03:29:21.170 --> 03:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
how the breakdown goes this is from New
 
03:29:23.630 --> 03:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute who
 
03:29:25.729 --> 03:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
wins from the interest in dividends tax
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
cuts chart on the back you'll see that
 
03:29:30.889 --> 03:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
almost all of that the money is paid by
 
03:29:30.899 --> 03:29:32.269 align:start position:0%
almost all of that the money is paid by
uh

03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:35.469 --> 03:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
a small number of people
 
03:29:37.969 --> 03:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
and these are the people to whom it
 
03:29:39.830 --> 03:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if you think about it if
 
03:29:43.610 --> 03:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
you thought about your investment
 
03:29:47.210 --> 03:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
um or my investment in stocks that I get
 
03:29:49.330 --> 03:29:49.340 align:start position:0%
dividends on
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
that so I have a say a million dollar
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
investment in stocks and I get a four
 
03:29:58.969 --> 03:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
percent return
 
03:30:00.650 --> 03:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
um which is reasonable return for a
 
03:30:02.690 --> 03:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
dividend or interest
 
03:30:04.250 --> 03:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
um then I'm getting forty thousand
 
03:30:06.410 --> 03:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
dollars and I'm paying five percent of
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
that that's two dollars on the thousand
 
03:30:09.239 --> 03:30:11.330 align:start position:0%
that that's two dollars on the thousand
okay

03:30:11.330 --> 03:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
now you're going to give wealthy people
 
03:30:15.650 --> 03:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
who don't need it two dollars on the
 
03:30:17.929 --> 03:30:17.939 align:start position:0%
thousand tax break
 
03:30:19.490 --> 03:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
and what are we doing to property tax
 
03:30:19.500 --> 03:30:22.610 align:start position:0%
and what are we doing to property tax
owners

03:30:22.610 --> 03:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:24.110 --> 03:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're not giving them that kind of tax
 
03:30:27.290 --> 03:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
break so my question is who are we
 
03:30:29.330 --> 03:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
really paying attention to here and who
 
03:30:31.670 --> 03:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
are we really helping what I think we
 
03:30:34.190 --> 03:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
need to do and as as you folks did last
 
03:30:36.830 --> 03:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
year and I thank you very much for it
 
03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
um is giving the one-time
 
03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
um uh sharing of Municipal and teacher
 
03:30:42.600 --> 03:30:44.870 align:start position:0%
um uh sharing of Municipal and teacher
pensions

03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
pensions
 
03:30:47.809 --> 03:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
we need to make that permanent again in
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
2011 they had to they had to drop that I
 
03:30:54.050 --> 03:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
guess they had to drop it I wasn't there
 
03:30:56.990 --> 03:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
um because of the recession
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
but my gosh that's 12 years ago
 
03:31:02.929 --> 03:31:02.939 align:start position:0%
um here we we say we have all this extra
 
03:31:05.330 --> 03:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
money we're in such great shape and yet
 
03:31:08.090 --> 03:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
we're going to cut taxes on the wealthy
 
03:31:12.050 --> 03:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
so that and not be able to give back
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh the teacher in Municipal pensions
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
that towns have been having to pay for
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
12 years
 
03:31:21.410 --> 03:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't seem right to me and and
 
03:31:24.710 --> 03:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
the other thing in my town
 
03:31:27.050 --> 03:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
we have a number of properties that are
 
03:31:29.570 --> 03:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
deteriorating you know roofs falling in
 
03:31:32.809 --> 03:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
and so forth and our town clerks or our
 
03:31:36.170 --> 03:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
town manager says well I can't I can't
 
03:31:39.530 --> 03:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
take them to court it's too expensive
 
03:31:41.690 --> 03:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
so these are sitting there deteriorating
 
03:31:44.809 --> 03:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
because people don't need the money uh
 
03:31:47.450 --> 03:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'm it's you know it's it's it's on a
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
Excel spreadsheet I've got you know 100
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
houses on here I'm not paying any
 
03:31:55.429 --> 03:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
attention that's what happens when you
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
have stagnant wealth you know you give
 
03:32:00.650 --> 03:32:00.660 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollar check to me uh on my
 
03:32:07.010 --> 03:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
you know uh from my cutting the tax you
 
03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
give me a two thousand dollar check I'm
 
03:32:10.429 --> 03:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna stow it in my checking
 
03:32:12.410 --> 03:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
account and it's going to sit there you
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
give a 200 check to someone who needs it
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to go back into the economy
 
03:32:20.690 --> 03:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
and that two hundred dollars is is going
 
03:32:22.370 --> 03:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
to go to the grocer and it's going to go
 
03:32:24.050 --> 03:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
from the grocer to the farmer and from
 
03:32:26.090 --> 03:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
the farmer to to the person that they
 
03:32:28.610 --> 03:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
owe money and that's going to be spent
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
five times and turned into from 200 into
 
03:32:33.590 --> 03:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars in the economy
 
03:32:35.870 --> 03:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
whereas you give it back to someone
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
who's affluent it just sits there and it
 
03:32:38.750 --> 03:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything
 
03:32:38.760 --> 03:32:40.490 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything
so

03:32:40.490 --> 03:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
um I can say that I think that HP 192 is
 
03:32:47.030 --> 03:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
a good idea it's a good idea to update
 
03:32:50.769 --> 03:32:50.779 align:start position:0%
the floor in 1976 is a long time ago
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a good idea to reinstate the
 
03:32:58.010 --> 03:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
tax at five percent the people who it
 
03:33:01.010 --> 03:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
affects will not be seriously affected
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm certainly not going to leave New
 
03:33:06.889 --> 03:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for two thousand dollars
 
03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
so I thank you very much
 
03:33:14.090 --> 03:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:17.210 --> 03:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh representative Malloy
 
03:33:20.210 --> 03:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking uh my
 
03:33:21.650 --> 03:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
question senator
 
03:33:21.660 --> 03:33:22.910 align:start position:0%
question senator
uh

03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:25.610 --> 03:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
this this may be
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
it may not be fair to ask you to answer
 
03:33:30.830 --> 03:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
this question but what we heard this
 
03:33:31.969 --> 03:33:31.979 align:start position:0%
morning was
 
03:33:36.110 --> 03:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
that the GDP in New Hampshire is growing
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's what growing it's increasing it's
 
03:33:40.670 --> 03:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
been on another subject and and I'm
 
03:33:43.790 --> 03:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
seeing your uh
 
03:33:46.370 --> 03:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
chart here today showing the growth in
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
the population
 
03:33:52.370 --> 03:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
and seniors and the decline in adults
 
03:33:54.889 --> 03:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
18 to 64.
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh again this may be an unfair question
 
03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
but how can we have an increased GDP
 
03:34:06.110 --> 03:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
with the declining population
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
I I and again I'm not
 
03:34:11.929 --> 03:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put anybody it may be
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
impossible I I don't know you're talking
 
03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
to someone who used to run an
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
intelligent robotics company so I can
 
03:34:19.450 --> 03:34:19.460 align:start position:0%
answer that question very easily
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
but um it's productivity obviously
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
um but I think the thing is that looking
 
03:34:29.809 --> 03:34:29.819 align:start position:0%
at GDP uh is is a very misleading
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
statistic because GDP is
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
if if your billionaires are doubling and
 
03:34:38.809 --> 03:34:38.819 align:start position:0%
well we don't have too many billionaires
 
03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but your 100
 
03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
millionaires are doubling uh their
 
03:34:43.080 --> 03:34:44.150 align:start position:0%
millionaires are doubling uh their
wealth

03:34:44.150 --> 03:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
wealth
 
03:34:47.570 --> 03:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
then your average GDP is going to be
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
going way up but that doesn't mean that
 
03:34:54.050 --> 03:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
the people who are still getting 12 an
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
hour or ten dollars an hour are doing
 
03:34:57.170 --> 03:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
any better and in fact they're doing
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:03.710 --> 03:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:12.239 --> 03:35:13.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:35:13.010 --> 03:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:16.010 --> 03:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
the chart on the back page of your
 
03:35:16.020 --> 03:35:17.809 align:start position:0%
the chart on the back page of your
handout

03:35:17.809 --> 03:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
handout
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh who wins from interest in dividends
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
tax cuts
 
03:35:25.070 --> 03:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
catch this in to representative omni's
 
03:35:29.050 --> 03:35:29.060 align:start position:0%
bill the bill that we're hearing here
 
03:35:32.269 --> 03:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
and as I
 
03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
the for maybe you could explain this
 
03:35:37.729 --> 03:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
chart and how it's How
 
03:35:40.790 --> 03:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
moving to a higher exemption level as
 
03:35:44.210 --> 03:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
has been proposed would change this
 
03:35:44.220 --> 03:35:46.309 align:start position:0%
has been proposed would change this
picture

03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
picture
 
03:35:49.790 --> 03:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
yes exactly that's a great question
 
03:35:52.610 --> 03:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
um so uh as you can see from the pi
 
03:35:56.450 --> 03:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
that's on that chart about 10 percent of
 
03:35:59.090 --> 03:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
people file we're looking at the chart
 
03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:00.110 align:start position:0%
people file we're looking at the chart
um

03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:02.750 --> 03:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
yeah at the top right hand corner of the
 
03:36:06.110 --> 03:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
back and the pi on that chart shows that
 
03:36:09.070 --> 03:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent of people file this tax
 
03:36:09.080 --> 03:36:10.610 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent of people file this tax
and

03:36:10.610 --> 03:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:13.849 --> 03:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
um so of the 10 percent
 
03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.550 --> 03:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
well of course I don't know the
 
03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
particular proportion but about uh
 
03:36:23.950 --> 03:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
certainly the
 
03:36:27.130 --> 03:36:27.140 align:start position:0%
11162 are not going to file the 11
 
03:36:30.710 --> 03:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
063 you're not going to file and uh
 
03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
about probably about half of the 25 54
 
03:36:40.370 --> 03:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.729 --> 03:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
so um fewer than half of the people who
 
03:36:46.190 --> 03:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
know if I would would have to file
 
03:36:50.690 --> 03:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:50.700 --> 03:37:06.050 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:37:06.050 --> 03:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:06.060 --> 03:37:08.389 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:37:08.399 --> 03:37:09.170 align:start position:0%
right
um

03:37:09.170 --> 03:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:11.570 --> 03:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
so after doing that after taking out all
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers
 
03:37:16.910 --> 03:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
how does the chart look
 
03:37:19.250 --> 03:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
same way as we're looking at it here
 
03:37:23.690 --> 03:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
yeah yes this is from a few years ago
 
03:37:25.370 --> 03:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
um oh I didn't write the year I don't
 
03:37:28.250 --> 03:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
think on here it was from uh New
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute
 
03:37:30.720 --> 03:37:33.469 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute
um

03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing 2020 figures but I'm not
 
03:37:39.469 --> 03:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure of that so it would have
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
been at the higher rate
 
03:37:45.889 --> 03:37:45.899 align:start position:0%
um that was in in place then so the the
 
03:37:49.250 --> 03:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
figures would look something like they
 
03:37:50.809 --> 03:37:50.819 align:start position:0%
are now
 
03:37:50.819 --> 03:37:52.969 align:start position:0%
are now
um

03:37:52.969 --> 03:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:52.979 --> 03:37:56.269 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:37:56.269 --> 03:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:58.670 --> 03:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
what I want to say was that
 
03:37:58.680 --> 03:37:59.090 align:start position:0%
what I want to say was that
[Music]

03:37:59.090 --> 03:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:37:59.100 --> 03:38:00.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:38:00.830 --> 03:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:02.330 --> 03:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
I've sort of Forgotten what I want to
 
03:38:02.340 --> 03:38:07.790 align:start position:0%
I've sort of Forgotten what I want to
say

03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:07.800 --> 03:38:10.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:38:10.010 --> 03:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:11.630 --> 03:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I forgotten what I was going
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
to say yeah it looks like we're going to
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
hear from you on the next bill which is
 
03:38:16.190 --> 03:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
related topics so we can get back
 
03:38:17.389 --> 03:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
together yeah but we do have one more
 
03:38:19.790 --> 03:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
question for you representative orrs
 
03:38:21.530 --> 03:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I believe it was
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
last week Mr Dupree I forget his first
 
03:38:29.330 --> 03:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
name but he was saying that we have uh
 
03:38:31.370 --> 03:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
conquered being a resettlement community
 
03:38:34.309 --> 03:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
that we have many families moving into
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
the area uh and not only are they moving
 
03:38:39.889 --> 03:38:39.899 align:start position:0%
into the area there are they're his best
 
03:38:42.530 --> 03:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
workers so these people are moving in
 
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
and I also heard testimony about uh
 
03:38:48.769 --> 03:38:48.779 align:start position:0%
families in the range of 29 to I think
 
03:38:51.530 --> 03:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
it was the low 40s moving into New
 
03:38:54.050 --> 03:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so though our population ages
 
03:38:56.830 --> 03:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't have babies born at
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
zero we have people families moving into
 
03:39:02.450 --> 03:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for the recreational
 
03:39:05.809 --> 03:39:05.819 align:start position:0%
opportunities and they're in the 29 to I
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
think it was low 40 range so I mean
 
03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a disconnect
 
03:39:13.370 --> 03:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
in uh what we heard last week and what
 
03:39:15.050 --> 03:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
you're sharing with us today can you
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
maybe expound on that for us
 
03:39:21.170 --> 03:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
well uh this sounds like case studies
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
um of good projects
 
03:39:25.870 --> 03:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
and we want to do more of those
 
03:39:28.849 --> 03:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
and uh get more of that kind of thing
 
03:39:31.250 --> 03:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
going on but as far as the overall
 
03:39:33.530 --> 03:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
statistics uh it's headed in this
 
03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
direction which which is unfortunate
 
03:39:38.870 --> 03:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
um but yeah no that's that's very
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
encouraging news that we'd have some
 
03:39:42.590 --> 03:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
projects that are working
 
03:39:44.450 --> 03:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
okay representative fellows has a
 
03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:45.650 align:start position:0%
okay representative fellows has a
question

03:39:45.650 --> 03:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:39:47.210 --> 03:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm new to this committee and so I've
 
03:39:52.729 --> 03:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
had a lot coming at me all at once
 
03:39:54.530 --> 03:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
um I had I had always thought of
 
03:39:57.530 --> 03:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax being assessed
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
on individuals but I have the sense now
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
that maybe it's not just individuals
 
03:40:06.710 --> 03:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's some some of the payers or the
 
03:40:10.130 --> 03:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
corporations or something like that uh
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
corporations that have Investments would
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
be paying do they pay you know what why
 
03:40:15.889 --> 03:40:15.899 align:start position:0%
don't we leave that we have the folks
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
from Dr Ray here and we'll leave some of
 
03:40:19.490 --> 03:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
that technical questions for them and
 
03:40:20.750 --> 03:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
they might be able to help us with that
 
03:40:24.530 --> 03:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
if that's okay okay thank you very much
 
03:40:27.050 --> 03:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
okay we'll recognize Dennis Hall from
 
03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
incorrectly on the pink slip but I I am
 
03:40:41.690 --> 03:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to this bill and
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'll save the bulk of my commentary for
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing on um the repeal of the
 
03:40:48.170 --> 03:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
interest of dividends tax but I do want
 
03:40:50.809 --> 03:40:50.819 align:start position:0%
to say a little bit about rich people
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
and whether we want them here in New
 
03:40:55.190 --> 03:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I believe the answer to
 
03:40:58.010 --> 03:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
that is unambiguously yes we can save
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
criticism of billionaires and the entire
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
capitalistic system for the federal
 
03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
level where it doesn't matter where the
 
03:41:07.010 --> 03:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
rich people reside but
 
03:41:09.469 --> 03:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
people are fleeing California and other
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
high-tax blue States in droves the top
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
five states that lost residents in the
 
03:41:17.929 --> 03:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
last two years are also among the top
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
six income tax highest income tax states
 
03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
these people are moving to places like
 
03:41:27.650 --> 03:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
Florida Arizona Ohio states that do not
 
03:41:29.150 --> 03:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
have an income tax or have a very low
 
03:41:31.010 --> 03:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
tax burden
 
03:41:33.530 --> 03:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is technically a no-income
 
03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
tax state but there's always this
 
03:41:36.530 --> 03:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
asterisk next to
 
03:41:38.450 --> 03:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
um its name because it taxes interests
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
and dividends and as as others have
 
03:41:43.130 --> 03:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
pointed out much of the income and net
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
worth of of millionaires and
 
03:41:46.969 --> 03:41:46.979 align:start position:0%
billionaires comes from interest
 
03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
dividends that they receive on their
 
03:41:50.210 --> 03:41:50.220 align:start position:0%
stocks and their portfolios so when
 
03:41:52.250 --> 03:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
they're deciding where to move New
 
03:41:53.570 --> 03:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is always going to have that
 
03:41:55.370 --> 03:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
condition attached to it and it's a
 
03:41:57.290 --> 03:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
disincentive for them to come here they
 
03:41:59.210 --> 03:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
are the source of a significant part of
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
the state budget I don't have a number
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
in mind but they do pay quite a few
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
taxes here in New Hampshire they move
 
03:42:06.590 --> 03:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
here they buy houses they pay property
 
03:42:08.210 --> 03:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
taxes which are the third highest in the
 
03:42:10.490 --> 03:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
country and it contributes a significant
 
03:42:12.410 --> 03:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
amount to government revenues I don't
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
really see a problem with incentivizing
 
03:42:16.610 --> 03:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
um the wealthy people to move here to
 
03:42:17.990 --> 03:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and continue population
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
growth as hundreds of thousands of
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
people leave California every year and
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
these states continue to propose
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
egregious wealth taxes on top of what
 
03:42:28.670 --> 03:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
they already have California legislature
 
03:42:31.130 --> 03:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
is considering a 1.5 percent wealth tax
 
03:42:34.610 --> 03:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
on the worldwide net worth of all people
 
03:42:37.250 --> 03:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
making over a billion dollars and in
 
03:42:39.410 --> 03:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
2026 that threshold will be lowered to
 
03:42:41.570 --> 03:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars anybody making over
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars will have to pay 1.5
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
percent of their entire net worth on top
 
03:42:49.010 --> 03:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
of a 13 a 13 income tax rate New
 
03:42:50.929 --> 03:42:50.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state in the
 
03:42:50.939 --> 03:42:52.010 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state in the
Northeast

03:42:52.010 --> 03:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
Northeast
 
03:42:52.020 --> 03:42:53.389 align:start position:0%
Northeast
with

03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:42:55.610 --> 03:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
at least a plan to become a no-income
 
03:42:57.229 --> 03:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
tax state and a state that already does
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
not tax wages or other income
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity for rich people
 
03:43:04.729 --> 03:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
to move somewhere other than the Sun
 
03:43:07.010 --> 03:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
Belt the closest the closest state to
 
03:43:08.330 --> 03:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with no income tax is
 
03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
actually Tennessee and this is this is
 
03:43:12.110 --> 03:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
really more of an opportunity to attract
 
03:43:14.150 --> 03:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
people who could contribute to higher
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
government revenues even in a recession
 
03:43:17.570 --> 03:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
because these people will still have
 
03:43:19.190 --> 03:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
money and they're not relying on their
 
03:43:21.170 --> 03:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
wage income and
 
03:43:22.729 --> 03:43:22.739 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really matter because they're
 
03:43:24.650 --> 03:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
not relying on employment
 
03:43:26.690 --> 03:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
um to keep paying their taxes so I just
 
03:43:28.130 --> 03:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out and I guess
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
also that middle and low-class people
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
are also buying stocks and they're also
 
03:43:34.130 --> 03:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
receiving dividends and interest on
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
things like treasury bonds and inflation
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
bonds which I guess got nine percent a
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
couple months ago I know quite a few
 
03:43:41.809 --> 03:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
people myself who are buying these they
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't make a lot of money but
 
03:43:46.910 --> 03:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
they are also paying taxes
 
03:43:48.769 --> 03:43:48.779 align:start position:0%
um on stocks and bonds to a degree that
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
we've never really seen before with the
 
03:43:52.729 --> 03:43:52.739 align:start position:0%
Advent of platforms like Robinhood and
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
other ways for ordinary people to buy
 
03:43:56.330 --> 03:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
stocks and try to protect their income
 
03:43:59.330 --> 03:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
against the ravages of inflation so I
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that um I don't I
 
03:44:03.769 --> 03:44:03.779 align:start position:0%
don't really see a reason why
 
03:44:03.779 --> 03:44:04.429 align:start position:0%
don't really see a reason why
um

03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:07.370 --> 03:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
we should Target wealthy people um with
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
a reimposition of this interest in
 
03:44:11.330 --> 03:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
dividends tax when they do have other
 
03:44:13.610 --> 03:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
options and honestly like more lucrative
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
options I'm from Florida and I know a
 
03:44:17.630 --> 03:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
lot of people who prefer to move there
 
03:44:19.370 --> 03:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
but you know the Northeast is beautiful
 
03:44:21.469 --> 03:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
and we should incentivize these people
 
03:44:22.849 --> 03:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
to move here
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.849 --> 03:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
would you entertain questions
 
03:44:28.859 --> 03:44:30.290 align:start position:0%
would you entertain questions
yes

03:44:30.290 --> 03:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:44:30.300 --> 03:44:31.030 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

03:44:31.030 --> 03:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:44:33.889 --> 03:44:33.899 align:start position:0%
uh over here representative putt yeah
 
03:44:35.450 --> 03:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
you've made a statement we don't tax
 
03:44:38.210 --> 03:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
wages what's the business Enterprise tax
 
03:44:40.370 --> 03:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
isn't that partner taxing wages correct
 
03:44:41.929 --> 03:44:41.939 align:start position:0%
I should have clarified that the state
 
03:44:43.210 --> 03:44:43.220 align:start position:0%
is not tax
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
income or wage income from individuals
 
03:44:48.349 --> 03:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax obviously would
 
03:44:50.929 --> 03:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
cover something like that
 
03:44:54.170 --> 03:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
right representative Phyllis
 
03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um I'm having a
 
03:44:59.330 --> 03:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
hard time understanding your logic
 
03:45:02.210 --> 03:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
because if we look at this chart we see
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
03:45:06.830 --> 03:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
um people with really high income or
 
03:45:09.290 --> 03:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
people or Corporation or whoever are are
 
03:45:12.830 --> 03:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
currently paying this tax
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
why would we want to elim you know why
 
03:45:17.630 --> 03:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we want to keep this tax so we
 
03:45:20.210 --> 03:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
get that revenue from them in terms of
 
03:45:20.220 --> 03:45:21.110 align:start position:0%
get that revenue from them in terms of
your

03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:45:24.170 --> 03:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
iron idea that they come here and they
 
03:45:27.889 --> 03:45:27.899 align:start position:0%
pay property taxes the ultra rep rich
 
03:45:27.899 --> 03:45:29.030 align:start position:0%
pay property taxes the ultra rep rich
people

03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
are are putting in million multi-million
 
03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
dollar homes in the towns where there's
 
03:45:39.889 --> 03:45:39.899 align:start position:0%
ocean Frontage or lake Frontage where
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
the taxes are the lowest
 
03:45:46.490 --> 03:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
I just don't and and on top of that
 
03:45:49.370 --> 03:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes they buy multiple houses and
 
03:45:50.929 --> 03:45:50.939 align:start position:0%
they're not even representative is there
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
a concise question here so I'm just
 
03:45:56.389 --> 03:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why you have your
 
03:45:59.809 --> 03:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
position giving given that rationale I
 
03:46:02.570 --> 03:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
just I'm not seeing how that benefits
 
03:46:05.809 --> 03:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at all well 62 percent of
 
03:46:07.729 --> 03:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's population growth is due
 
03:46:09.469 --> 03:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
to migration from other states and when
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
we see such historic numbers of people
 
03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
coming from high-tech States and moving
 
03:46:16.969 --> 03:46:16.979 align:start position:0%
to states with no income tax the
 
03:46:18.410 --> 03:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends prevents it
 
03:46:20.929 --> 03:46:20.939 align:start position:0%
presents a serious obstacle in their
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
decision-making process
 
03:46:26.210 --> 03:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
um and even if they do buy a house in a
 
03:46:29.210 --> 03:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
place with relatively low property taxes
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
um but I believe State Property Tax
 
03:46:32.690 --> 03:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
collections are still you know among the
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
top three in the nation and they're
 
03:46:37.969 --> 03:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
paying taxes on anything that they buy
 
03:46:39.650 --> 03:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
in the state which then contributes to
 
03:46:41.929 --> 03:46:41.939 align:start position:0%
business property business profits tax
 
03:46:44.570 --> 03:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
revenue which is taxed at a rate of 7.6
 
03:46:46.429 --> 03:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:46:48.290 --> 03:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
I believe that this money is something
 
03:46:48.300 --> 03:46:49.490 align:start position:0%
I believe that this money is something
that

03:46:49.490 --> 03:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:46:51.650 --> 03:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
the state should incentivize
 
03:46:54.050 --> 03:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
um to flow here rather than to other
 
03:46:55.670 --> 03:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
no-income tax states that don't have
 
03:46:57.710 --> 03:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
that condition on interest and dividends
 
03:46:59.030 --> 03:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
which does constitute a pretty
 
03:47:00.650 --> 03:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
significant portion of
 
03:47:04.490 --> 03:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.269 --> 03:47:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:10.729 --> 03:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
we've established in earlier testimony
 
03:47:12.050 --> 03:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:47:14.090 --> 03:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
this tax that we're talking about now
 
03:47:15.830 --> 03:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax has been
 
03:47:18.290 --> 03:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
around for a very long time it's one of
 
03:47:21.769 --> 03:47:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:25.070 --> 03:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
you've spoken about how you think this
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
tax disincentivizes people
 
03:47:30.170 --> 03:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
with lots of money to
 
03:47:33.849 --> 03:47:33.859 align:start position:0%
migrate to New Hampshire but you've also
 
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
spoken about how they are migrating to
 
03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:47:38.100 --> 03:47:40.370 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
apparently

03:47:40.370 --> 03:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
03:47:43.130 --> 03:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
even though we've had a five percent
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax on the books
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
throughout this
 
03:47:49.309 --> 03:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
relevant period of time perhaps for the
 
03:47:51.710 --> 03:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
last hundred years or more
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
um what evidence do you have that it's
 
03:47:58.269 --> 03:47:58.279 align:start position:0%
operating as a disincentive for people
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
who pay would if they can't Came Here
 
03:48:04.849 --> 03:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
Pay significant interest in dividends
 
03:48:04.859 --> 03:48:06.229 align:start position:0%
Pay significant interest in dividends
tax

03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's a way to draw
 
03:48:10.130 --> 03:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
this connection using actual numbers and
 
03:48:12.410 --> 03:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
evidence I would say that New Hampshire
 
03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
does not rank among the top states that
 
03:48:15.889 --> 03:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
people are moving to from States like
 
03:48:17.450 --> 03:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
California or pretty much anywhere else
 
03:48:19.490 --> 03:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
I believe the population growth is on a
 
03:48:21.950 --> 03:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
decline somewhat 11 000 people or so
 
03:48:24.290 --> 03:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
last year but these people are still
 
03:48:26.929 --> 03:48:26.939 align:start position:0%
moving in droves from places like
 
03:48:29.690 --> 03:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
California which lost I believe 130 000
 
03:48:33.170 --> 03:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
people last year and the true no income
 
03:48:35.450 --> 03:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
tax states remain far ahead of New
 
03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in terms of population growth
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
and where these people are moving to
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
from the blue States and I believe
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
eliminating this particular obstacle
 
03:48:46.309 --> 03:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
could contribute somewhat to making New
 
03:48:48.170 --> 03:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just as an attractive of an
 
03:48:50.630 --> 03:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity as Florida or Texas or
 
03:48:52.370 --> 03:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
Arizona or any of these other places
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
that are so far away and honestly just
 
03:48:57.050 --> 03:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
don't have many of the benefits in terms
 
03:48:58.969 --> 03:48:58.979 align:start position:0%
of new in terms of just New Hampshire
 
03:49:01.010 --> 03:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's natural beauty being in
 
03:49:03.010 --> 03:49:03.020 align:start position:0%
the Northeast all of these other things
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that this could provide some
 
03:49:06.769 --> 03:49:06.779 align:start position:0%
sort of incentive I don't know if you
 
03:49:09.050 --> 03:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
could actually track that over time and
 
03:49:10.250 --> 03:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
see you know you'd have to survey
 
03:49:11.809 --> 03:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
somebody and say why are you moving to
 
03:49:14.150 --> 03:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for this reason but it
 
03:49:15.410 --> 03:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
would be an ideal way to continue
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
population growth as we continue to see
 
03:49:21.410 --> 03:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
people moving in record numbers from
 
03:49:23.330 --> 03:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
states that are the highest taxes in the
 
03:49:25.910 --> 03:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
nation clearly that's a driving factor
 
03:49:28.130 --> 03:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
in why these people are moving and if
 
03:49:30.590 --> 03:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
they don't want to pay any income taxes
 
03:49:31.910 --> 03:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
they would look at this interest in
 
03:49:33.889 --> 03:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
dividends tax and say well I still have
 
03:49:35.750 --> 03:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
to pay five percent every year on this I
 
03:49:37.309 --> 03:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that in States like
 
03:49:39.229 --> 03:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
Florida or South Carolina or states that
 
03:49:42.170 --> 03:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
are even moving to a no income tax such
 
03:49:46.490 --> 03:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
as Iowa Kentucky Mississippi Georgia
 
03:49:48.889 --> 03:49:48.899 align:start position:0%
um and States like that so it would put
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:49:52.010 --> 03:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
um on a competitive level with the rest
 
03:49:53.330 --> 03:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
of these states that are seeing this
 
03:49:55.610 --> 03:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
kind of massive growth
 
03:49:57.769 --> 03:49:57.779 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it okay
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
we'll recognize Catherine I'm gonna kill
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
it again Lao head from tax Foundation
 
03:50:13.210 --> 03:50:13.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
03:50:17.090 --> 03:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
committee again my name is Catherine
 
03:50:18.889 --> 03:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
lawhead I'm with the tax foundation in
 
03:50:21.650 --> 03:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
Washington DC and once again we do not
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
take a position on legislation but I
 
03:50:25.490 --> 03:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
would like to share some information
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
about this bill and the impacts that
 
03:50:30.290 --> 03:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
would have
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
um as you know House Bill 192 would
 
03:50:34.190 --> 03:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
repeal the planned phase out of the
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax and increase
 
03:50:38.450 --> 03:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
the rate back up to five percent
 
03:50:40.370 --> 03:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
and it would also increase the interest
 
03:50:42.650 --> 03:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax exemption from two
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred dollars to seven
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars and the
 
03:50:48.170 --> 03:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
additional exemption for taxpayers who
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
are 65 or older blind or disabled would
 
03:50:53.090 --> 03:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
be increased from one thousand two
 
03:50:54.590 --> 03:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
hundred to three thousand five hundred
 
03:50:54.600 --> 03:50:55.790 align:start position:0%
hundred to three thousand five hundred
dollars

03:50:55.790 --> 03:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:50:58.849 --> 03:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
now phasing out the tax on interest and
 
03:51:01.190 --> 03:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
dividends income as New Hampshire is in
 
03:51:02.950 --> 03:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
the process of doing
 
03:51:05.330 --> 03:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
would cause New Hampshire to join the
 
03:51:07.130 --> 03:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
ranks of the seven other states that
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
forego in individual income tax entirely
 
03:51:13.010 --> 03:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
so there's very little justification
 
03:51:15.710 --> 03:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
right now given the current budget
 
03:51:17.630 --> 03:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
surplus and given the state's historic
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue growth
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
to do away with a plan to phase out this
 
03:51:25.010 --> 03:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
tax over time
 
03:51:28.250 --> 03:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
in particular increasing the events the
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax rate while
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
increasing the associated exemptions as
 
03:51:34.250 --> 03:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
this bill would do would actually narrow
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
the tax base while increasing their rate
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
which is generally the opposite of what
 
03:51:42.290 --> 03:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
good tax policy tries to do generally a
 
03:51:44.750 --> 03:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
broader base and a lower rate generates
 
03:51:46.910 --> 03:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
a Stabler source of Revenue and is a
 
03:51:49.090 --> 03:51:49.100 align:start position:0%
more preferable tax structure
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
but increasing the rate while increasing
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
the exemption would place would shift a
 
03:51:57.410 --> 03:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
larger amount of the tax burden onto a
 
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
smaller subset of the population
 
03:52:02.450 --> 03:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire truly does find itself
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
in a revenue bind in the future which it
 
03:52:07.190 --> 03:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
is not in currently but if that is the
 
03:52:09.469 --> 03:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
case in the future there are better
 
03:52:12.769 --> 03:52:12.779 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue to turn to than the
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax uh such as the
 
03:52:19.130 --> 03:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax which as I
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier is a very stable
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue compared to some of
 
03:52:26.110 --> 03:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
the other taxes New Hampshire levies
 
03:52:29.450 --> 03:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
additionally the tax on real property is
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
a highly stable source of Revenue and
 
03:52:33.950 --> 03:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
that can help the state whether economic
 
03:52:36.290 --> 03:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
downturns quite well
 
03:52:38.570 --> 03:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
over the past decade the states that
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
forego and individual income tax have
 
03:52:43.490 --> 03:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
seen their populations grow at twice the
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
national rate and this is really
 
03:52:47.809 --> 03:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
something New Hampshire could uh benefit
 
03:52:50.330 --> 03:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
from as well especially in an era where
 
03:52:52.610 --> 03:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
there's increased workplace flexibility
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people are able to have
 
03:52:58.010 --> 03:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
hybrid or completely remote work
 
03:52:58.020 --> 03:52:59.330 align:start position:0%
hybrid or completely remote work
environments

03:52:59.330 --> 03:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
environments
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are looking to move to
 
03:53:03.950 --> 03:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
places where they the cost of living
 
03:53:06.410 --> 03:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
cost of living and the tax burden is
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
relatively lower so New Hampshire should
 
03:53:12.170 --> 03:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
look to take advantage of that I'll also
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
mention that a lot of the burden of this
 
03:53:17.570 --> 03:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
tax does fall on not just the wealthy
 
03:53:20.269 --> 03:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
but on everyday citizens including lower
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
and middle income people who do have
 
03:53:26.210 --> 03:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
investment portfolios and have you know
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
pensions or 401K plans and other
 
03:53:32.570 --> 03:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
Investments that this tax would fall on
 
03:53:36.229 --> 03:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
so by allowing folks to keep more of the
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
return on their Investments they will
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
have more money to spend and save as
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
they see fit and they will have more
 
03:53:44.570 --> 03:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
money to reinvest in the state's economy
 
03:53:47.210 --> 03:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
so with that I am happy to answer any
 
03:53:47.220 --> 03:53:51.349 align:start position:0%
so with that I am happy to answer any
questions

03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.330 --> 03:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands up so thank you
 
03:53:55.070 --> 03:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
03:53:58.849 --> 03:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
okay and now we have the dra here uh
 
03:54:01.309 --> 03:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
Lauren O'Sullivan and Wendy metivier
 
03:54:02.929 --> 03:54:02.939 align:start position:0%

03:54:27.610 --> 03:54:27.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:29.929 --> 03:54:29.939 align:start position:0%
would you care to summarize what you're
 
03:54:31.010 --> 03:54:31.020 align:start position:0%

03:55:52.370 --> 03:55:52.380 align:start position:0%

03:56:02.030 --> 03:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
and estimates are equal to 25 percent of
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
the estimated tax and they're either due
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%

03:56:23.229 --> 03:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:56:25.969 --> 03:56:25.979 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative rosenford had a
 
03:56:26.689 --> 03:56:26.699 align:start position:0%
question and then we'll go to
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey yes thank you madam
 
03:56:30.889 --> 03:56:30.899 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
 
03:56:32.570 --> 03:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and I'm looking at this and I
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
compared it to the fiscal note that was
 
03:56:36.769 --> 03:56:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill the same the table two
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
just so I'm understanding this properly
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
and I may not be so please forgive me
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the way I'm reading this and the way
 
03:56:48.050 --> 03:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
I'm interpreting this if we were to if
 
03:56:49.849 --> 03:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass
 
03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh HB 192 were to be enacted into law
 
03:56:59.229 --> 03:56:59.239 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at that table two
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
then we would then be levying an
 
03:57:02.640 --> 03:57:03.910 align:start position:0%
then we would then be levying an
additional

03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:57:07.550 --> 03:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
116 million dollars a year in taxes by
 
03:57:13.010 --> 03:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:15.530 --> 03:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
am I reading that right
 
03:57:17.570 --> 03:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
that that's right when compared to the
 
03:57:19.370 --> 03:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
current law which has the phase out to
 
03:57:22.490 --> 03:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
zero percent okay it's not additional
 
03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's maintaining
 
03:57:28.490 --> 03:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
but but if but the way it is now the law
 
03:57:30.110 --> 03:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
may follow up
 
03:57:33.950 --> 03:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
so so the way it is now as of you know
 
03:57:37.490 --> 03:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
today the law is the the we're scheduled
 
03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
to phase out correct so that
 
03:57:43.729 --> 03:57:43.739 align:start position:0%
but if we were to pass this 192 we're
 
03:57:46.969 --> 03:57:46.979 align:start position:0%
essentially not phasing it out so we
 
03:57:49.309 --> 03:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
were then adding 116 million dollars in
 
03:57:51.050 --> 03:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
taxes yeah I went cramped like that yes
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.910 --> 03:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative ulery first and then
 
03:58:00.710 --> 03:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:58:04.250 --> 03:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question if I heard you
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
correctly you you
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned llc's Etc
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
as paying this tax
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh if they receive more than that seven
 
03:58:15.889 --> 03:58:15.899 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars in
 
03:58:19.010 --> 03:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend
 
03:58:19.020 --> 03:58:25.849 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend
s

03:58:25.849 --> 03:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:29.090 --> 03:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
let's say the threshold on the income is
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
twenty four hundred twenty four hundred
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
first single file I earned 4 800 for
 
03:58:37.790 --> 03:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
joint okay follow up Madam chair
 
03:58:42.110 --> 03:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
so essentially then that this if this
 
03:58:44.090 --> 03:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
goes back into effect
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
you're taxing small businesses an
 
03:58:50.750 --> 03:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.510 --> 03:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
over what they're paying now so this is
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
the tax on
 
03:58:57.290 --> 03:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
the heart spread of
 
03:58:59.150 --> 03:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses small
 
03:59:02.450 --> 03:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
businesses LLCs individual practitioners
 
03:59:06.290 --> 03:59:06.300 align:start position:0%

03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
formulary pharmacists not CVS and
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
Walgreens that's a different area
 
03:59:15.120 --> 03:59:18.650 align:start position:0%
Walgreens that's a different area
uh

03:59:18.650 --> 03:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:21.830 --> 03:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
any business that moderately successful
 
03:59:23.870 --> 03:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
in making a little bit of money have I
 
03:59:25.969 --> 03:59:25.979 align:start position:0%

03:59:28.490 --> 03:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
well the the IND tax
 
03:59:30.170 --> 03:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
um the composition of the tax is on
 
03:59:32.929 --> 03:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
interest dividends federal tax exempt
 
03:59:35.030 --> 03:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
interest and distributions so that's
 
03:59:37.610 --> 03:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
what would be subject to the tax
 
03:59:40.670 --> 03:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
so well one final follow-up just to make
 
03:59:43.370 --> 03:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
final follow-up see how this goes thank
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%

Savings in uh for their retirement and
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
instead of being
 
04:00:02.210 --> 04:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
deferred such as a Roth IRA will it be
 
04:00:05.389 --> 04:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
deferred or a regular Ira even with
 
04:00:07.570 --> 04:00:07.580 align:start position:0%
required minimum distribution would be
 
04:00:07.580 --> 04:00:09.250 align:start position:0%
required minimum distribution would be
uh

04:00:09.250 --> 04:00:09.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:00:13.370 --> 04:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
deferred at a lower uh lower tax rate
 
04:00:15.769 --> 04:00:15.779 align:start position:0%
they could hit with the full thing when
 
04:00:17.389 --> 04:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
they start taking money out is that
 
04:00:17.399 --> 04:00:18.530 align:start position:0%

so the question was asked how are we
 
04:01:03.830 --> 04:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
handing the blue sheet information I
 
04:01:05.929 --> 04:01:05.939 align:start position:0%
don't have a researcher sitting there to
 
04:01:08.929 --> 04:01:08.939 align:start position:0%
tell us we also don't know at the moment
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
who has logged in to the general court
 
04:01:14.929 --> 04:01:14.939 align:start position:0%
website and maybe testified through the
 
04:01:17.389 --> 04:01:17.399 align:start position:0%
portal I'm trying to learn that and I've
 
04:01:19.969 --> 04:01:19.979 align:start position:0%
got our assistant Karen working on that
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
to figure out how do we get that there
 
04:01:25.370 --> 04:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
is a link on the general court website
 
04:01:28.610 --> 04:01:28.620 align:start position:0%
that says View House online testimony

she did not tell me how to get there
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
though so as soon as we see someone
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll ask them that question
 
04:01:39.170 --> 04:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
um representative orrs do you would you
 
04:01:41.150 --> 04:01:41.160 align:start position:0%

bill
 
04:02:22.010 --> 04:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
and let's see one two three four five
 
04:02:25.550 --> 04:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
six seven people signed in
 
04:02:28.729 --> 04:02:28.739 align:start position:0%

04:02:30.170 --> 04:02:30.180 align:start position:0%

04:02:35.760 --> 04:02:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:36.960 --> 04:02:39.290 align:start position:0%
um
hmm

04:02:39.290 --> 04:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
04:02:43.309 --> 04:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:45.590 --> 04:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
and it's now two o'clock so we will now
 
04:02:47.570 --> 04:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
04:02:50.570 --> 04:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
100 to repeal the interest and dividends
 
04:02:50.580 --> 04:02:52.070 align:start position:0%
100 to repeal the interest and dividends
tax

04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you I may actually be a
 
04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this one so for the record
 
04:03:04.250 --> 04:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.250 --> 04:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
and we will now recognize the prime
 
04:03:09.530 --> 04:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative janigian to
 
04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:03:17.150 --> 04:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
I am representative John janegian
 
04:03:24.410 --> 04:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 25 which is Salem
 
04:03:28.210 --> 04:03:28.220 align:start position:0%
so HB 100
 
04:03:30.290 --> 04:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
we already have the interest in
 
04:03:33.229 --> 04:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
dividends taxed as most of you probably
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
known or if you don't will be phased out
 
04:03:39.650 --> 04:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
as of January 1st 2027.
 
04:03:42.889 --> 04:03:42.899 align:start position:0%
so this bill HP 100 what it does is
 
04:03:46.210 --> 04:03:46.220 align:start position:0%
proposes accelerating that phase out
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
to January 1st 2024.
 
04:03:50.279 --> 04:03:51.469 align:start position:0%
to January 1st 2024.
foreign

04:03:51.469 --> 04:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:03:53.330 --> 04:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we basically tout
 
04:03:56.530 --> 04:03:56.540 align:start position:0%
ourselves as uh income tax-free State
 
04:03:59.450 --> 04:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
however the one asterisk as I think has
 
04:04:01.309 --> 04:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
been mentioned uh previously actually
 
04:04:03.650 --> 04:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
two states had that asterisk Tennessee
 
04:04:06.769 --> 04:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire both income income
 
04:04:09.050 --> 04:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
tax-free States however taxing interest
 
04:04:10.490 --> 04:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
and dividends
 
04:04:12.889 --> 04:04:12.899 align:start position:0%
so Tennessee has now removed their
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax so New
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only one left now with
 
04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
the asterisk
 
04:04:18.300 --> 04:04:19.490 align:start position:0%
the asterisk
um

04:04:19.490 --> 04:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:21.950 --> 04:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
so this again this bill proposes to
 
04:04:24.290 --> 04:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
phase out the interest in dividends tax
 
04:04:27.769 --> 04:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
um by January 1st 2024.
 
04:04:30.010 --> 04:04:30.020 align:start position:0%
what are the advantages of of doing this
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
obviously there's there's been a lot of
 
04:04:34.670 --> 04:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
talk about should we be doing this
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
what's the effect of it we're worrying
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
about potential recession
 
04:04:42.290 --> 04:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
but the one thing that that happens a
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
lot of times with tax policy it's always
 
04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
looked at as though it was a static
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
thing if we reduce this tax by this much
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
then we lose this much but nothing in
 
04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
life is static everything's Dynamic
 
04:04:58.490 --> 04:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of interactions going
 
04:04:58.500 --> 04:04:59.410 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of interactions going
on

04:04:59.410 --> 04:04:59.420 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
in various ways so
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
first off
 
04:05:07.550 --> 04:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things and it's been
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
mentioned before but and it's one of my
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
points so I had already added down but
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
we want to stop the migration of wealthy
 
04:05:17.090 --> 04:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
individuals once they retire out of New
 
04:05:20.269 --> 04:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and from New Hampshire a lot
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
of them are going to Florida you know we
 
04:05:24.290 --> 04:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of States like New York and
 
04:05:27.650 --> 04:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
California are losing people to other
 
04:05:29.330 --> 04:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
states usually not New Hampshire
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
although as a side comment which I don't
 
04:05:33.189 --> 04:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
have on this sheet
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
I do have some income property and I am
 
04:05:40.250 --> 04:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
a pair of this of this tax but um two of
 
04:05:43.250 --> 04:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
my most recent tenants are in the 25 to
 
04:05:45.950 --> 04:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
30 year old range both moving out of New
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
York to escape high taxes now neither of
 
04:05:51.170 --> 04:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
these guys are just starting out they're
 
04:05:53.330 --> 04:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
not paying interest in dividends tax but
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about the future they
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
like the fact of the the the tax
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
lowering tax lower taxes in New
 
04:06:02.689 --> 04:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as when they think
 
04:06:05.150 --> 04:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
about you know later years
 
04:06:07.610 --> 04:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
so I think it can have an effect on on
 
04:06:10.370 --> 04:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
younger people as well
 
04:06:10.380 --> 04:06:11.689 align:start position:0%
younger people as well
um

04:06:11.689 --> 04:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
the I I believe eliminating the interest
 
04:06:16.370 --> 04:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax and this is where we
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
can't think about things as just being
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
static right is will most likely lead to
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
higher business profits taxes and the
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
many um and I believe it's dra can can
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
correct me here but many of the llc's
 
04:06:37.150 --> 04:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
corporations with transferable shares
 
04:06:39.889 --> 04:06:39.899 align:start position:0%
have to pay those individuals have to
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
pay a tax on their distributions of of
 
04:06:46.729 --> 04:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
profit and that is treated as a dividend
 
04:06:49.610 --> 04:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
so they're paying a five percent tax on
 
04:06:52.849 --> 04:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
that that's five percent less money that
 
04:06:53.889 --> 04:06:53.899 align:start position:0%
can go into
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know building the business paying
 
04:06:57.600 --> 04:06:59.170 align:start position:0%
uh you know building the business paying
employees

04:06:59.170 --> 04:06:59.180 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:07:02.349 --> 04:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
investing in the future of the business
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
paying higher wages to employees all
 
04:07:06.050 --> 04:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
sorts of things again we have to keep
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about the dynamic nature of
 
04:07:10.189 --> 04:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
this and not get caught up in just the
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
static nature of reducing attacks
 
04:07:13.680 --> 04:07:14.689 align:start position:0%
static nature of reducing attacks
um

04:07:14.689 --> 04:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:16.729 --> 04:07:16.739 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I believe would
 
04:07:19.250 --> 04:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
happen is people will migrate oh we
 
04:07:20.389 --> 04:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
already know this people are migrating
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
to states with lower taxes and
 
04:07:25.309 --> 04:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
while we are getting some people
 
04:07:27.650 --> 04:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
migraines to New Hampshire we are losing
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
out on the high net worth people and I
 
04:07:32.929 --> 04:07:32.939 align:start position:0%
I'll disagree with a speaker from a
 
04:07:36.650 --> 04:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
previous bill I heard where when you get
 
04:07:38.330 --> 04:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
when wealthy get extra money they just
 
04:07:41.210 --> 04:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
put it in the bank I I strongly disagree
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
with that wealthy people don't focus on
 
04:07:46.010 --> 04:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
just putting money in a bank and letting
 
04:07:48.769 --> 04:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
it sit there they want to expand that
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
money they're going to invest it in
 
04:07:53.570 --> 04:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
businesses and the more people wealthy
 
04:07:55.490 --> 04:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
people we have in New Hampshire the more
 
04:07:57.170 --> 04:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
likely they are to invest in New
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and many of them
 
04:08:00.769 --> 04:08:00.779 align:start position:0%
are business owners and they may in fact
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
bring their business from another state
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire so I don't think we
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
want to overlook that potential
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then you know we we do know that a
 
04:08:14.689 --> 04:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
lot of older people retirees are paying
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax no matter
 
04:08:18.590 --> 04:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
what their level is as long as they're
 
04:08:20.269 --> 04:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
above the um
 
04:08:23.809 --> 04:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
the uh the minimum deduction and so it's
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
not fair that that elderly elderly and
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
retired are paying a larger burden
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
um of their taxes because of that
 
04:08:34.560 --> 04:08:36.229 align:start position:0%
um of their taxes because of that
um

04:08:36.229 --> 04:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:38.150 --> 04:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I guess I already I already made my
 
04:08:39.170 --> 04:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
last Point
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
um that uh with the elimination of
 
04:08:42.530 --> 04:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
attacks more wealthy are likely to come
 
04:08:44.990 --> 04:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
to the state so those are the reasons I
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
believe that while when you look at the
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it may look like a large
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
number there I don't believe that's
 
04:08:53.809 --> 04:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
going to be the final that's a static
 
04:08:57.170 --> 04:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
number that's a static result of just
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
reducing it without looking at all these
 
04:09:02.809 --> 04:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
positives that will happen increasing
 
04:09:05.689 --> 04:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
which will increase actually the BET tax
 
04:09:08.809 --> 04:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
the BPT tax and I believe increased
 
04:09:11.330 --> 04:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
investment in businesses which will also
 
04:09:14.210 --> 04:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
result in Greater growth for New
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and higher business profits
 
04:09:17.809 --> 04:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
taxes thank you and I'll take any
 
04:09:17.819 --> 04:09:20.870 align:start position:0%
taxes thank you and I'll take any
questions

04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
representative fellows then
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
 
04:09:25.250 --> 04:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:28.130 --> 04:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if you can I'm having
 
04:09:30.170 --> 04:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
such a hard time getting a understanding
 
04:09:33.170 --> 04:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
of who pays the tax
 
04:09:35.290 --> 04:09:35.300 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned corporations with
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
transferable shares can can you just
 
04:09:41.090 --> 04:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
give me like a hypothetical example of
 
04:09:43.070 --> 04:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
like what kind of company is that a
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
hedge fund or what what kind of company
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
is that and what might be going on yeah
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not an expert in tax policy
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
and dra can probably answer this but for
 
04:09:54.590 --> 04:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
example there an example of
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
non-transferable shares would be like
 
04:09:59.389 --> 04:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
somebody starts an LLC they've got a
 
04:10:01.729 --> 04:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
couple members three members whatever
 
04:10:05.870 --> 04:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
they can't just sell a portion of that I
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
believe they they have to actually
 
04:10:09.170 --> 04:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
dissolve the LLC you can't change the
 
04:10:11.389 --> 04:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
ownership easily so a company with
 
04:10:14.090 --> 04:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
transferable shares is set up such that
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
you can sell you know a certain
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
percentage of that company to another
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
individual and then they can become a
 
04:10:22.030 --> 04:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
shareholder so it's all those companies
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh where the llc's ins you know
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
incorporate the companies
 
04:10:28.319 --> 04:10:29.150 align:start position:0%
incorporate the companies
um

04:10:29.150 --> 04:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
there are Partnerships with transferable
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
shares so it just depends on the setup
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
but all those companies when they
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
distribute their profits to their
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
shareholders those shareholders have to
 
04:10:41.389 --> 04:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
pay the interest and dividends tax so
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
you could think of it as a portion of
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
that money which could you know Partners
 
04:10:47.809 --> 04:10:47.819 align:start position:0%
don't just again take their money and
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
put it in the bank I mean somebody might
 
04:10:52.370 --> 04:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
but typically they're investing in other
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
things maybe they're investing it back
 
04:10:55.370 --> 04:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
in that business or they're investing in
 
04:10:57.170 --> 04:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
other businesses and this is what I mean
 
04:10:58.969 --> 04:10:58.979 align:start position:0%
by there's a dynamic interaction here
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's not just static
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
thank you that's the closest I've got to
 
04:11:11.689 --> 04:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:13.030 --> 04:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:16.849 --> 04:11:16.859 align:start position:0%
on this is an extraordinarily difficult
 
04:11:19.010 --> 04:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
area and there have been studies on both
 
04:11:19.020 --> 04:11:20.389 align:start position:0%
area and there have been studies on both
sides

04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
sides
 
04:11:24.170 --> 04:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
about people migrating uh away from
 
04:11:26.330 --> 04:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
high-tech States and people not
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
migrating away from high-tech States the
 
04:11:32.330 --> 04:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
demographer let the last two times he
 
04:11:34.969 --> 04:11:34.979 align:start position:0%
came in said that more low-income people
 
04:11:38.450 --> 04:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
than higher income people leave New
 
04:11:38.460 --> 04:11:39.710 align:start position:0%
than higher income people leave New
Hampshire

04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
I've just wanted to see what you
 
04:11:52.189 --> 04:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
you think of these numbers
 
04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess the rest of it would be
 
04:11:56.450 --> 04:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
something I am going to have to say at
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
Great Lengths when we get to the to the
 
04:12:01.080 --> 04:12:01.670 align:start position:0%
Great Lengths when we get to the to the
um

04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just remind the members of
 
04:12:05.809 --> 04:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
the committee that this is our time to
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
hear from the public or the sponsor and
 
04:12:10.250 --> 04:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
to ask clarifying questions on what the
 
04:12:12.110 --> 04:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is what the rationale
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
was maybe the data that they have
 
04:12:16.130 --> 04:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
obviously what the executive session
 
04:12:17.929 --> 04:12:17.939 align:start position:0%
we'll all get to say are little speeches
 
04:12:20.510 --> 04:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
about how we feel about the policy so
 
04:12:22.849 --> 04:12:22.859 align:start position:0%
we'll have a chance to do that later uh
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions for or did
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
you want to try to answer that or
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
take it under advisement
 
04:12:31.849 --> 04:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh we'll take that under advisement
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
because I I can talk I can talk
 
04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
generally on how I feel on that but I'd
 
04:12:38.809 --> 04:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
rather talk about actual data thank you
 
04:12:42.050 --> 04:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
excellent yes
 
04:12:43.969 --> 04:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
can you turn on your mic so everyone can
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
can we please have a work session on
 
04:12:49.370 --> 04:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
this rather than
 
04:12:51.950 --> 04:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
just the executive session after we've
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
all made our minds up
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
I will take that under advisement thank
 
04:12:59.150 --> 04:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you oh representative orrs
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question so earlier you
 
04:13:05.809 --> 04:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the dra could probably
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
give us a better example of where these
 
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
numbers would fall because if I
 
04:13:11.450 --> 04:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
understood what you said correctly if we
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
eliminate I and D we're probably going
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
to make money back through the business
 
04:13:19.849 --> 04:13:19.859 align:start position:0%
profit tax is that correct so follow-up
 
04:13:22.250 --> 04:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:13:24.410 --> 04:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
who would give us those kind of
 
04:13:26.809 --> 04:13:26.819 align:start position:0%
estimates what what agency what group
 
04:13:28.969 --> 04:13:28.979 align:start position:0%
what organization in New Hampshire gives
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
us those estimates
 
04:13:35.150 --> 04:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
well I don't know presumably dra but but
 
04:13:37.610 --> 04:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
exactly that that's what I thought and
 
04:13:41.389 --> 04:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
and so my question is why is it that we
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
are hearing from the dra they obviously
 
04:13:46.910 --> 04:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
are bipartisan
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
but they can never give us an estimate
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
whether any of these uh positions are
 
04:13:53.929 --> 04:13:53.939 align:start position:0%
going to be uh raising the tax or
 
04:13:56.750 --> 04:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
lowering the tax well I'll let the dra
 
04:13:58.849 --> 04:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
answer that but my understanding is that
 
04:14:02.410 --> 04:14:02.420 align:start position:0%
the the it's very hard to put together
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
an absolute Dynamic model so the models
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
are based on static you know you reduce
 
04:14:11.150 --> 04:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
it by this much here's how much you lose
 
04:14:13.130 --> 04:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
I so I don't know what the future of
 
04:14:15.170 --> 04:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
creating Dynamic models are or whether
 
04:14:16.610 --> 04:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
they have a better answer than I just
 
04:14:19.010 --> 04:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
gave you okay thank you very much thank
 
04:14:20.929 --> 04:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you representative
 
04:14:24.830 --> 04:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay we will now recognize former Vice
 
04:14:26.929 --> 04:14:26.939 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee representative
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
Patrick Obama who is also here
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.170 --> 04:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm joined by Dan McGuire who's also
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
here from Granite State
 
04:14:40.250 --> 04:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire could you also
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
give a giving card at some point thank
 
04:14:44.150 --> 04:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
you can sit together if that works
 
04:14:48.550 --> 04:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever works for you guys
 
04:14:50.689 --> 04:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
well it's good to be back in ways of
 
04:14:53.150 --> 04:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
means good to have you guys back
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
an hour ago I was downstairs testifying
 
04:14:57.650 --> 04:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
I was on the somehow I got wrangled and
 
04:14:59.150 --> 04:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
being on the rear-facing car seat
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
chairing the rear-facing car seat
 
04:15:05.330 --> 04:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
committee with the Senate of uh and uh
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
I actually wrote the final report so I
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
figured I'd better go down there and
 
04:15:11.210 --> 04:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
present the report to this Committee in
 
04:15:14.450 --> 04:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
the Senate so it's good to be back uh
 
04:15:17.929 --> 04:15:17.939 align:start position:0%
since I've left you uh the Granite City
 
04:15:19.250 --> 04:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
taxpayers approached me to be on their
 
04:15:22.490 --> 04:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
board so I'm wearing that hat but I hope
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
the chair will give me a little latitude
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
to also wear my other hat the private
 
04:15:27.290 --> 04:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
citizen had in my knowledge of ways and
 
04:15:27.300 --> 04:15:28.610 align:start position:0%
citizen had in my knowledge of ways and
means

04:15:28.610 --> 04:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
means
 
04:15:31.389 --> 04:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
uh the Granite City taxpayers
 
04:15:34.130 --> 04:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly support uh house bill
 
04:15:37.790 --> 04:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
100. and do not support House Bill 192
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
which would be reversed last year's or
 
04:15:44.090 --> 04:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh movement towards elimination of
 
04:15:46.010 --> 04:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax
 
04:15:48.590 --> 04:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
oh representative fellows just left I'll
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
wait hope this gets back while I'm still
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
talking uh do we think she left because
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
I have an answer to her question
 
04:15:56.689 --> 04:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
about an example and some of you who
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
have been in ways of means for a while I
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
I was a owner of a company in
 
04:16:04.250 --> 04:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh which was an S corp
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
and when I moved to New Hampshire we
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
discovered that every distribution that
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
we would get to either take profit out
 
04:16:13.849 --> 04:16:13.859 align:start position:0%
of the company or to pay federal taxes
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
I was New Hampshire recognized that as a
 
04:16:19.729 --> 04:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
dividend and I had to pay five percent
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
every time I did it got a distribution
 
04:16:23.090 --> 04:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire
 
04:16:25.610 --> 04:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
uh so this that would go away that's
 
04:16:28.729 --> 04:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
that's an example of what I think
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
Department of sponsor was trying to
 
04:16:32.330 --> 04:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
trying to bring out
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
the thing I hope that the committee does
 
04:16:37.729 --> 04:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
is view this this particular bill in
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
regard to the other well I would say out
 
04:16:42.290 --> 04:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
of two tax cut bills that you heard this
 
04:16:45.530 --> 04:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
morning uh House Bill 15 moving the BET
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
from 0.55 to 0.5 and the uh uh house
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 133 communication Services
 
04:16:52.800 --> 04:16:54.229 align:start position:0%
house bill 133 communication Services
tax

04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:16:56.150 --> 04:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
because when I looked at the fiscal
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
reports with notes at least the ones
 
04:17:01.010 --> 04:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
with the bills not the updated ones we
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
were talking in 24 combined all those
 
04:17:06.410 --> 04:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
three of 62.5 million reduction
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
uh for 24 and in 25
 
04:17:13.130 --> 04:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
135.6 million dollar reduction in
 
04:17:16.250 --> 04:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
revenues in those two fiscal years
 
04:17:19.130 --> 04:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
so we can't view this bill in isolation
 
04:17:21.769 --> 04:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
we have to view it in in looking at the
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
other tax reduction bills at the same
 
04:17:23.279 --> 04:17:24.490 align:start position:0%
other tax reduction bills at the same
time

04:17:24.490 --> 04:17:24.500 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:17:28.370 --> 04:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh I I certainly support and I this is
 
04:17:30.349 --> 04:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
where I want a little attitude just to
 
04:17:34.969 --> 04:17:34.979 align:start position:0%
say that I I do support uh the uh to be
 
04:17:37.610 --> 04:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
bet reduction uh the granite state
 
04:17:39.950 --> 04:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't taken a position on it that we
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
were told to testify on
 
04:17:46.250 --> 04:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
and then there's the uh so the uh the
 
04:17:49.130 --> 04:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
Communication Service tax bill
 
04:17:51.530 --> 04:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
which I have some hesitation on to be
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
honest with you and the reason I have
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
hesitation on that one is we can't strip
 
04:17:57.950 --> 04:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
away all our tax base
 
04:18:00.769 --> 04:18:00.779 align:start position:0%
uh because the beauty of New Hampshire
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
is taxes is that we have a broad base of
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
taxes that buffer us from recession up
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
and down
 
04:18:10.010 --> 04:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
we tend to have a less of a of a decline
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
in a recession and a quicker return
 
04:18:14.570 --> 04:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
after a recession because of the spread
 
04:18:17.150 --> 04:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
of the taxes that we have
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
so I I would caution on the
 
04:18:21.250 --> 04:18:21.260 align:start position:0%
telecommunity that's 30 million dollars
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's a couple bucks and everybody's
 
04:18:25.490 --> 04:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
telephone bill
 
04:18:28.849 --> 04:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh just for the for the uh the voice
 
04:18:32.570 --> 04:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
part not not the uh not the data part so
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh that's just my two cents there
 
04:18:36.239 --> 04:18:38.590 align:start position:0%
uh that's just my two cents there
uh

04:18:38.590 --> 04:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:41.590 --> 04:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
the uh by the way
 
04:18:44.830 --> 04:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
our our treasury
 
04:18:47.650 --> 04:18:47.660 align:start position:0%
loves in our our bond rating agencies
 
04:18:49.969 --> 04:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
loves the fact that we have a broad base
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
of taxes to to work from uh we always
 
04:18:55.969 --> 04:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
rate very high uh we we have good good
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
Bond ratings and and they also like the
 
04:19:00.410 --> 04:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
fact that we have a robust rainy day
 
04:19:00.420 --> 04:19:01.849 align:start position:0%
fact that we have a robust rainy day
fund

04:19:01.849 --> 04:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:19:01.859 --> 04:19:03.170 align:start position:0%
fund
so

04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:19:03.180 --> 04:19:04.910 align:start position:0%
so
uh

04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
I'm so I'm assuming that all these bills
 
04:19:09.290 --> 04:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
are not early bills
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that it's just a ways it
 
04:19:13.250 --> 04:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
means Bell so you don't have to exec
 
04:19:15.530 --> 04:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
these right away if you don't want to
 
04:19:18.410 --> 04:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
I and I know you're in the middle of of
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
looking at revenues and we've had a good
 
04:19:22.610 --> 04:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
we've had a good run the last two years
 
04:19:25.729 --> 04:19:25.739 align:start position:0%
no question about it I mean where are we
 
04:19:29.809 --> 04:19:29.819 align:start position:0%
are well above Target you know last year
 
04:19:31.849 --> 04:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
411 million
 
04:19:35.150 --> 04:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh totaled 249 million just for the
 
04:19:36.530 --> 04:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
04:19:39.410 --> 04:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
and and this year to date including
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
through yesterday we're up uh 236
 
04:19:46.370 --> 04:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
million for all taxes and 145 million
 
04:19:49.130 --> 04:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
from business taxes so it continues
 
04:19:53.450 --> 04:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
and the beauty of our business taxes
 
04:19:56.929 --> 04:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
is that you know the reason I really
 
04:19:58.729 --> 04:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
support moving the point five to the
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
point five is that was our plan all
 
04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
along and there's no question in my mind
 
04:20:02.760 --> 04:20:04.429 align:start position:0%
along and there's no question in my mind
that

04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:06.650 --> 04:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
that the the amount of Revenue we're
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
getting on our business tax revenues
 
04:20:12.050 --> 04:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
with reduced taxes is clear that we've
 
04:20:14.570 --> 04:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
attracted businesses here that are truly
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
turning out uh a lot of profits that are
 
04:20:20.150 --> 04:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
turning into tax revenue for us
 
04:20:23.090 --> 04:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
so but I know you're faced with as you
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
do your revenues
 
04:20:24.720 --> 04:20:25.849 align:start position:0%
do your revenues
uh

04:20:25.849 --> 04:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:28.130 --> 04:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
there's you have to determine how far is
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
it going to be a recession or not
 
04:20:32.809 --> 04:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
to me we're partly in it already
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh measure the impact of housing sales
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
which have slowed although prices have
 
04:20:38.570 --> 04:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
stayed High
 
04:20:42.889 --> 04:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
uh impact of Massachusetts passing uh
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
sports betting
 
04:20:46.309 --> 04:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
on on lottery
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
I was just chatting with someone
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday about this and there's some
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
concern there
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh then obviously we have to understand
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
the impact of single sales factor that
 
04:20:57.950 --> 04:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
we move to
 
04:21:01.790 --> 04:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh despite Ways and Means house ways
 
04:21:03.650 --> 04:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
it means objections
 
04:21:03.660 --> 04:21:05.090 align:start position:0%
it means objections
uh

04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
then of course there's the
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
um the lowering of the allowable credit
 
04:21:11.689 --> 04:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
carry forward for some of the new
 
04:21:12.889 --> 04:21:12.899 align:start position:0%
members I don't know if you guys have
 
04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
already talked about this uh that you
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
know the credit carry forward is an
 
04:21:18.410 --> 04:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
issue we're not quite sure what that's
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
going to amount to
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh that we start writing checks back to
 
04:21:22.199 --> 04:21:23.450 align:start position:0%
uh that we start writing checks back to
companies

04:21:23.450 --> 04:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
companies
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
who who who don't want the money they
 
04:21:27.290 --> 04:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
want to keep the money they want us to
 
04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
keep the money but we're forcing them to
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
take the money back
 
04:21:29.880 --> 04:21:31.189 align:start position:0%
take the money back
so

04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:33.889 --> 04:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
with that all said I would I do support
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
this uh but I would
 
04:21:40.130 --> 04:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
I would because my two cents Mr Madam
 
04:21:40.140 --> 04:21:40.969 align:start position:0%
I would because my two cents Mr Madam
chair

04:21:40.969 --> 04:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:21:42.889 --> 04:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
uh you don't have to execute these right
 
04:21:44.210 --> 04:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
away you can see what the revenue
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
numbers look like as you once you get
 
04:21:47.150 --> 04:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
through your process of Revenue
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
projecting and then you can make the
 
04:21:51.050 --> 04:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
calls down as to which of these you want
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
to want to act on but I do support the
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
the reduction in this Bill thank you
 
04:22:01.610 --> 04:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire do you
 
04:22:02.689 --> 04:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
want to go ahead and then we'll do a
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
quick round of questions thank you
 
04:22:06.290 --> 04:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you very much Madam
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee for the
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
record my name is Dan McGuire I'm here
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
represented Granite Granite State
 
04:22:12.479 --> 04:22:14.389 align:start position:0%
represented Granite Granite State
taxpayers

04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
04:22:16.490 --> 04:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
um this committee's loss has been our
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
gain with Pat here
 
04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
um we have long maintained that the
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax is the worst
 
04:22:28.450 --> 04:22:28.460 align:start position:0%
tax that we have in terms of uh
 
04:22:31.070 --> 04:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
economics it's the most economically
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
destructive tax we have so there are a
 
04:22:36.410 --> 04:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
lot of different taxes and we all know
 
04:22:38.809 --> 04:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
that when you tax something you get less
 
04:22:42.410 --> 04:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
of it so some taxes that's deliberate
 
04:22:45.170 --> 04:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
right like the cigarette tax tobacco tax
 
04:22:47.809 --> 04:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
for example it's a good thing that there
 
04:22:50.570 --> 04:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
are less smoking because of that tax
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
right that's deliberate there's other
 
04:22:55.790 --> 04:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
things the communication tax maybe
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit less use of
 
04:22:59.150 --> 04:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
communication maybe it doesn't make much
 
04:22:59.160 --> 04:23:00.910 align:start position:0%
communication maybe it doesn't make much
difference

04:23:00.910 --> 04:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:23:00.920 --> 04:23:02.530 align:start position:0%
difference
and

04:23:02.530 --> 04:23:02.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
so consumption taxes are not so
 
04:23:07.849 --> 04:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
economically destructive they they work
 
04:23:10.130 --> 04:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
a little against that particular area so
 
04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
things like the rooms and meal stacks
 
04:23:13.610 --> 04:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
and so on there's a little bit less
 
04:23:16.130 --> 04:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
rental income there's a little bit less
 
04:23:18.110 --> 04:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
restaurant meals and so on because of
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
that tax but overall in the economy it
 
04:23:22.269 --> 04:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't make that much of a difference
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
but by comparison to the interest in
 
04:23:27.469 --> 04:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
dividend taxes the interest in dividends
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
tax is is a direct tax on investment and
 
04:23:31.439 --> 04:23:32.809 align:start position:0%
tax is is a direct tax on investment and
savings

04:23:32.809 --> 04:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
savings
 
04:23:36.650 --> 04:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
and investment in savings are what makes
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
the future better than today
 
04:23:45.370 --> 04:23:45.380 align:start position:0%
right so in order to to be economically
 
04:23:47.889 --> 04:23:47.899 align:start position:0%
in better shape tomorrow
 
04:23:51.290 --> 04:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
we need investment and savings today
 
04:23:53.530 --> 04:23:53.540 align:start position:0%
investment in savings by his capital
 
04:23:56.830 --> 04:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
capital and cruise improves productivity
 
04:23:59.210 --> 04:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
productivity means higher standard of
 
04:23:59.220 --> 04:24:00.349 align:start position:0%
productivity means higher standard of
living

04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
living
 
04:24:03.769 --> 04:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
so without any you know if they're ABS
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know if if absolutely everything
 
04:24:09.410 --> 04:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
created was consumed then tomorrow at
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
best could be equal to today right
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
except that things wear out and so on
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
but but if we have savings if we have
 
04:24:20.809 --> 04:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
investment that's what makes tomorrow
 
04:24:24.769 --> 04:24:24.779 align:start position:0%
better than today and and in an economic
 
04:24:28.969 --> 04:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
sense that is human happiness that's you
 
04:24:31.210 --> 04:24:31.220 align:start position:0%
know having a better tomorrow than today
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
is what makes people happier and so on
 
04:24:40.450 --> 04:24:40.460 align:start position:0%
right so so it's that this tax is is
 
04:24:43.969 --> 04:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
restricting something that we that we
 
04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
want to we would rather encourage right
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
I mean it's almost like
 
04:24:50.809 --> 04:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
you'd want to match somebody's sayings
 
04:24:54.290 --> 04:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
in an investment rather than tax it all
 
04:24:56.150 --> 04:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
right because it's that important to the
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
economy so
 
04:25:00.290 --> 04:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
um so this tax is the one if you if
 
04:25:01.969 --> 04:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
there's any one tax you're going to be
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
able to cut this year
 
04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh in our mind this is it thank you
 
04:25:09.650 --> 04:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:13.189 --> 04:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:16.370 --> 04:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh representative all me no I've got a
 
04:25:18.309 --> 04:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
question for
 
04:25:23.150 --> 04:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
The Honorable abrami uh this I keep
 
04:25:25.130 --> 04:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
hearing this thing about we come out of
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
recessions quicker
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
than other states we never thought that
 
04:25:34.729 --> 04:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
before do you have any data on this
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
I've heard that many times in ways and
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
means that we've come out of recessions
 
04:25:38.159 --> 04:25:40.130 align:start position:0%
means that we've come out of recessions
faster

04:25:40.130 --> 04:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
faster
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
on would that be the gross domestic
 
04:25:44.929 --> 04:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
product or something it's following the
 
04:25:44.939 --> 04:25:46.070 align:start position:0%
product or something it's following the
revenues

04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:25:48.610 --> 04:25:48.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:52.490 --> 04:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:54.050 --> 04:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
because we don't have an income tax with
 
04:25:55.550 --> 04:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
04:25:57.050 --> 04:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
which makes us different than other
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
states other states get impacted more by
 
04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
recessions because of the broad-based
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
taxes that they have that's usually the
 
04:26:05.870 --> 04:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
driver and we're we're impacted less
 
04:26:08.330 --> 04:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
because that when this recession less
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
people are working less less income tax
 
04:26:14.750 --> 04:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
people are buying less less sales tax we
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
don't we have those buffers because we
 
04:26:17.990 --> 04:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't have those taxes we have other
 
04:26:19.550 --> 04:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
taxes that are there people won't give
 
04:26:21.889 --> 04:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
up their phones for instance I mean Most
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
states have telecommunication taxes as
 
04:26:23.640 --> 04:26:24.530 align:start position:0%
states have telecommunication taxes as
well

04:26:24.530 --> 04:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:26:27.410 --> 04:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
but we we are protected by the uh the
 
04:26:30.349 --> 04:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
way our our taxes are are structured in
 
04:26:33.290 --> 04:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
such a way that that we we just don't
 
04:26:35.870 --> 04:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
get impacted as much by recession as
 
04:26:37.309 --> 04:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
other states
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative Schoenberg Schamberg has
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.830 --> 04:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
could I comment on that question
 
04:26:47.929 --> 04:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
04:26:50.689 --> 04:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
um I used to live uh in Washington state
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
near Oregon those states are are uh
 
04:26:57.769 --> 04:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
heavily affected because they have they
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
have very large specific Employers in
 
04:27:02.990 --> 04:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
Washington state it's Microsoft and
 
04:27:07.550 --> 04:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
Boeing in Oregon it's Intel and so and
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
so a recession that hurts those
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
particular employers puts a huge Downer
 
04:27:15.290 --> 04:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
on those particular States New Hampshire
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that sort of thing New
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a lot of very of small and
 
04:27:23.330 --> 04:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
medium businesses they don't have a
 
04:27:26.450 --> 04:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
dominant employer in the same way and so
 
04:27:28.370 --> 04:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
you know if this one is affected a
 
04:27:30.410 --> 04:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
little bit that one might not be and so
 
04:27:32.689 --> 04:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
and so so we have a much more even
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
keeled economy I think than than many
 
04:27:38.809 --> 04:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
other states which have those kind of
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
big dominant businesses
 
04:27:43.550 --> 04:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg and then
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
04:27:47.809 --> 04:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:27:50.809 --> 04:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
I will ask for a second question here
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
depending on their answer on the first
 
04:27:52.560 --> 04:27:53.450 align:start position:0%
depending on their answer on the first
one

04:27:53.450 --> 04:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:27:53.460 --> 04:27:54.769 align:start position:0%
one
uh

04:27:54.769 --> 04:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:57.950 --> 04:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
either one of you could answer this
 
04:27:57.960 --> 04:27:59.389 align:start position:0%
either one of you could answer this
um

04:27:59.389 --> 04:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:02.389 --> 04:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
when you have an LLC
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
so in this particular case I I think
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
Pat was right that that the
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
distributions from an LLC come under
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
this tax okay um
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't know I guess I'm not as well
 
04:28:32.090 --> 04:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know bptvt well enough to to
 
04:28:34.450 --> 04:28:34.460 align:start position:0%
comment on that one do you yeah yeah
 
04:28:39.170 --> 04:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:43.550 --> 04:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
if there's no other taxes paid bet or
 
04:28:43.560 --> 04:28:45.889 align:start position:0%
if there's no other taxes paid bet or
BPT

04:28:45.889 --> 04:28:45.899 align:start position:0%
BPT
 
04:28:45.899 --> 04:28:47.870 align:start position:0%
BPT
how

04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:28:51.469 --> 04:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
does an LLC support our infrastructure
 
04:28:55.330 --> 04:28:55.340 align:start position:0%
Market if they're not taxed at all from
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
roads electronic electricity uh
 
04:29:02.330 --> 04:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
just our Marketplace
 
04:29:05.710 --> 04:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
other than hiring people I guess but
 
04:29:10.570 --> 04:29:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:12.889 --> 04:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
I mean there's a reason why we have the
 
04:29:16.969 --> 04:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
bet I mean to keep pet came in place for
 
04:29:19.729 --> 04:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
the for the sole Proprietors and for the
 
04:29:19.739 --> 04:29:21.590 align:start position:0%
the for the sole Proprietors and for the
LLCs

04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
LLCs
 
04:29:24.170 --> 04:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
I mean was cabletron that that was the
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
one that complained years ago that well
 
04:29:28.670 --> 04:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
these guys aren't paying any tax so we
 
04:29:31.250 --> 04:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
put the bet in place which is a tax on
 
04:29:33.110 --> 04:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
the number of employees you have
 
04:29:36.590 --> 04:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh and and then you know if you make a
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
profit that's fine
 
04:29:40.250 --> 04:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
but you know they offset each other and
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
all that so so llc's are paying taxes
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
under the bet
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding yeah and that may not
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
be a question they can answer fully
 
04:29:52.370 --> 04:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of LLC they have I
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
could answer that at a further time but
 
04:29:55.130 --> 04:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
we don't want to interrupt this public
 
04:29:56.689 --> 04:29:56.699 align:start position:0%
hearing on this but we want to stay
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
focused please on this particular Bill
 
04:30:02.450 --> 04:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
and what it does representative uh
 
04:30:04.010 --> 04:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
Oliveri had a question and then
 
04:30:07.070 --> 04:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative orrs thanks
 
04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh belated happy birthday
 
04:30:14.570 --> 04:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative not too far off yeah
 
04:30:14.580 --> 04:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
representative not too far off yeah
um

04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:18.170 --> 04:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand what you said
 
04:30:19.969 --> 04:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
you had a corporation in Massachusetts
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
an escort yes which is a limited
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
Corporation right
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
and when it came time to pay taxes
 
04:30:29.929 --> 04:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
you made a withdrawal in order to pay
 
04:30:29.939 --> 04:30:32.210 align:start position:0%
you made a withdrawal in order to pay
taxes

04:30:32.210 --> 04:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay and oh
 
04:30:39.050 --> 04:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
if if that was the case
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
you were being taxed on the withdrawal
 
04:30:44.809 --> 04:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
so you were paying the tax to pay a tax
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so an S corp all your taxes flow
 
04:30:49.010 --> 04:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
through your personal income tax first
 
04:30:50.450 --> 04:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
off okay
 
04:30:53.570 --> 04:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
so what we do in Mike we did an old as
 
04:30:55.130 --> 04:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
Corps stews if you had to pay federal
 
04:30:57.889 --> 04:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
tax let's say quarterly we would give
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves distribution
 
04:31:02.090 --> 04:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
to that would flow to me into my
 
04:31:04.610 --> 04:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
personal account and then I would pay my
 
04:31:04.620 --> 04:31:05.990 align:start position:0%
personal account and then I would pay my
taxes

04:31:05.990 --> 04:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:31:09.050 --> 04:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
and we have a we had a tax attorney that
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
followed the letter of the law he has to
 
04:31:14.050 --> 04:31:14.060 align:start position:0%
report that to New Hampshire
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
that that there was a distribution
 
04:31:18.889 --> 04:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
because I lived in New Hampshire of
 
04:31:20.149 --> 04:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
course I lived in New Hampshire that
 
04:31:22.130 --> 04:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
that was the that was the problem
 
04:31:25.250 --> 04:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
so I would have to turn around and write
 
04:31:26.990 --> 04:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
a quarterly payment
 
04:31:31.010 --> 04:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
of of my uh of that uh
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
from that transaction to the dra every
 
04:31:34.920 --> 04:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
from that transaction to the dra every
quarter

04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
to to meet our requirements so yes that
 
04:31:41.929 --> 04:31:41.939 align:start position:0%
happens now we had a bill years ago and
 
04:31:43.849 --> 04:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
we hadn't built recently too
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
that tried to fix it's a quirk it was
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
one of our many quirks in in our tax
 
04:31:49.920 --> 04:31:51.170 align:start position:0%
one of our many quirks in in our tax
code

04:31:51.170 --> 04:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:31:54.050 --> 04:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
and be honest with you we did the dra
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
did the math
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
and they at the time they said to fix
 
04:32:01.130 --> 04:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
this problem it was all it would be a
 
04:32:04.969 --> 04:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
big negative to the revenues of
 
04:32:04.979 --> 04:32:06.110 align:start position:0%
big negative to the revenues of
of

04:32:06.110 --> 04:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:32:10.729 --> 04:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
even I voted against the bill because it
 
04:32:13.010 --> 04:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
was it would have helped me this bill
 
04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
would have helped me and I you know and
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
then we had a similar Bill a couple
 
04:32:18.370 --> 04:32:18.380 align:start position:0%
years ago didn't go anywhere
 
04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
but this would solve the problem because
 
04:32:25.070 --> 04:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
the the whole that whole tax will be
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
gone so
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
but again it was it was as described at
 
04:32:32.269 --> 04:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
the time as a court of our policy was
 
04:32:35.269 --> 04:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
recognized as an issue uh that needed to
 
04:32:38.689 --> 04:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
be fixed and we never fixed it
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh no representative orrs had a question
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to make sure that everyone
 
04:32:43.849 --> 04:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
gets a first round of questions first
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
and then we can go back for a second if
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
we need
 
04:32:49.250 --> 04:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my question just
 
04:32:52.389 --> 04:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.010 --> 04:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative liebly
 
04:32:56.809 --> 04:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
04:32:56.819 --> 04:32:58.010 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
question

04:32:58.010 --> 04:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:33:00.110 --> 04:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
um so there's an implication in the
 
04:33:01.550 --> 04:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
story you shared with us and I just
 
04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I understood the
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
implication correctly so when you moved
 
04:33:07.131 --> 04:33:07.141 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts up to New Hampshire
 
04:33:11.209 --> 04:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
and you had to pay the IND tax when you
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
took a disbursement
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
the implication is that that was more
 
04:33:18.250 --> 04:33:18.260 align:start position:0%
taxes than you had paid in Massachusetts
 
04:33:20.631 --> 04:33:20.641 align:start position:0%
is that am I
 
04:33:23.090 --> 04:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
did I interpret that my partners my
 
04:33:24.170 --> 04:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
other partners didn't have to pay
 
04:33:25.849 --> 04:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts then because they lived in
 
04:33:25.859 --> 04:33:26.990 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts then because they lived in
Massachusetts

04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:33:29.090 --> 04:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
I mean I I was the only one I was the
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
only five Partners I was the only one
 
04:33:32.529 --> 04:33:32.539 align:start position:0%
that lived in New Hampshire
 
04:33:35.689 --> 04:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
did you have
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
on your business
 
04:33:39.890 --> 04:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
oh yes I also had to pay I had to pay
 
04:33:43.910 --> 04:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
prop uh uh yes I had to pay income taxes
 
04:33:43.920 --> 04:33:45.230 align:start position:0%
prop uh uh yes I had to pay income taxes
in

04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
I had to pay personal income taxes in
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as well
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
but this is not an income this was this
 
04:33:55.131 --> 04:33:55.141 align:start position:0%
was a so did your taxes go up when you
 
04:33:56.810 --> 04:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire is that oh yeah
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
net although we're down the happy part
 
04:34:00.410 --> 04:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
of the story is that my partner is
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
recognizing this
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
kept me whole
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
they would they would basically up they
 
04:34:08.631 --> 04:34:08.641 align:start position:0%
gave me a greater payment
 
04:34:10.970 --> 04:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
in the distribution time they marked it
 
04:34:12.529 --> 04:34:12.539 align:start position:0%
up so that because then knowing that I
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
had to pay tax to New Hampshire so they
 
04:34:16.970 --> 04:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
kept me hold they didn't have to do that
 
04:34:19.010 --> 04:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
okay first round of questions good okay
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
is there a second round of questions
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
not at this time I don't think okay
 
04:34:28.849 --> 04:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
great thank you guys
 
04:34:32.929 --> 04:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll recognize Gene dish again
 
04:34:34.250 --> 04:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
Senator if I know you already covered a
 
04:34:38.029 --> 04:34:38.039 align:start position:0%
lot of these talking points in the last
 
04:34:40.010 --> 04:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
bill if you could keep it to new
 
04:34:49.269 --> 04:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:52.970 --> 04:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
my name my name is Gene dietch uh German
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
name uh the second vowel determines the
 
04:34:55.439 --> 04:34:57.109 align:start position:0%
name uh the second vowel determines the
sound

04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
sound
 
04:34:57.119 --> 04:34:58.010 align:start position:0%
sound
um

04:34:58.010 --> 04:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:01.250 --> 04:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
well you know uh you know that I'm
 
04:35:03.590 --> 04:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to 100
 
04:35:08.330 --> 04:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
um because I feel that this puts the
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
emphasis in the wrong direction again I
 
04:35:13.010 --> 04:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
I think we're given two dollars per
 
04:35:16.609 --> 04:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
thousand uh to the affluent and we
 
04:35:18.170 --> 04:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
really need
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
um now I appreciate uh representative
 
04:35:21.000 --> 04:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
um now I appreciate uh representative
guanami's

04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
guanami's
 
04:35:26.090 --> 04:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
um uh suggestion that we wait and look
 
04:35:28.849 --> 04:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
at the overall view rather than rushing
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
at any of these bills and and because
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
it's really the total picture that
 
04:35:39.650 --> 04:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
counts so I've heard that uh you know we
 
04:35:43.490 --> 04:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
come out of recession faster but if we
 
04:35:46.609 --> 04:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
come into a recession faster why did we
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
not reinstate
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
the teacher Municipal pensions that we
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
cut in 2011 because of the recession you
 
04:35:57.769 --> 04:35:57.779 align:start position:0%
know to me that's not uh coming out of
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
recession and when uh
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
what we've listened to is the issues
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
from a business point of view and I
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
understand those as I say I've I've run
 
04:36:12.670 --> 04:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
three businesses I sold one
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
to a to a public company
 
04:36:16.561 --> 04:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
to a to a public company
but

04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:36:18.000 --> 04:36:19.070 align:start position:0%
but
um

04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:23.150 --> 04:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
we're not looking at the real facts
 
04:36:25.730 --> 04:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
we've got these young people who are
 
04:36:27.769 --> 04:36:27.779 align:start position:0%
coming up in here hypothetically saying
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
oh well I think people are are moving to
 
04:36:33.650 --> 04:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
low-tech States uh and that that's the
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
reason we're moving out you can look at
 
04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
the census data and the Census Data
 
04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
actually shows uh what's happening okay
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
you can hypothesize that people are
 
04:36:47.150 --> 04:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
leaving California faster and going to
 
04:36:50.209 --> 04:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
Tennessee or wherever but I can tell you
 
04:36:52.010 --> 04:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
why people are moving from New Hampshire
 
04:36:54.769 --> 04:36:54.779 align:start position:0%
to Florida and you can look out the
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
window and see it right there
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay it's not because of the IND text
 
04:37:00.840 --> 04:37:01.429 align:start position:0%
okay it's not because of the IND text
um

04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:05.090 --> 04:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
I I think we need to look at both sides
 
04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
yes there there are impacts on business
 
04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:09.959 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
04:37:11.330 --> 04:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
um I was reading a Wall Street Journal
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
report the other day that said the uh
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
ballooning stock prices were really the
 
04:37:21.410 --> 04:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
result of pushing all this more money to
 
04:37:23.330 --> 04:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
the to the wealthy uh to the
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
billionaires at the bottom uh you push
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
that money in and they have nowhere to
 
04:37:29.810 --> 04:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
put it
 
04:37:32.330 --> 04:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
the the stock prices go up because
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's what there is to invest in so
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
when there's more money floating around
 
04:37:38.510 --> 04:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
it uh it uh inflates the stock prices
 
04:37:41.209 --> 04:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
and we've seen what happens after the
 
04:37:43.551 --> 04:37:43.561 align:start position:0%
balloon is is burst
 
04:37:47.570 --> 04:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
um that's not real gain and when
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
companies as what happened when the
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
stock prices are up when companies are
 
04:37:55.131 --> 04:37:55.141 align:start position:0%
not investing in r d when they are not
 
04:37:56.689 --> 04:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
investing in equipment but they are
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
buying back stock
 
04:38:00.830 --> 04:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's an indication that you've got a
 
04:38:03.650 --> 04:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
bubble and you are not through tax
 
04:38:05.410 --> 04:38:05.420 align:start position:0%
policy and giving them more money
 
04:38:09.051 --> 04:38:09.061 align:start position:0%
creating more wealth in the future so
 
04:38:11.410 --> 04:38:11.420 align:start position:0%
it's not something that always happens
 
04:38:15.890 --> 04:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
yes if if if uh if companies are short
 
04:38:18.410 --> 04:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
of money
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
um and uh and we give them incentives
 
04:38:23.570 --> 04:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
for r d
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
instead of incentives to give money back
 
04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
to shareholders
 
04:38:31.131 --> 04:38:31.141 align:start position:0%
you know these are two things
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
um and actually back in the days of very
 
04:38:33.719 --> 04:38:35.150 align:start position:0%
um and actually back in the days of very
high

04:38:35.150 --> 04:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
high
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
um uh taxes you know back in the 90
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
percent uh uh tax uh income tax
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
categories there was more money going
 
04:38:46.910 --> 04:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
into our Indian equipment and so forth
 
04:38:48.890 --> 04:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
because the owners didn't take it out of
 
04:38:50.689 --> 04:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
the company they wanted to put it into
 
04:38:51.949 --> 04:38:51.959 align:start position:0%
something that would create future
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
growth so it's it's not something that
 
04:38:56.810 --> 04:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
you can just continue doing the same
 
04:38:59.390 --> 04:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
thing over and over uh forever and it
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
always is good we balance okay you you
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
you put some money back in you take some
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
money out in taxes and put it into
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's all a balance and
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're out of balance right now
 
04:39:14.570 --> 04:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
the country is way out of balance and we
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
see that in in the number of
 
04:39:20.570 --> 04:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
billionaires and their increasing wealth
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
so what I'm suggesting is that we pay
 
04:39:26.810 --> 04:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
attention to those people that is it
 
04:39:30.429 --> 04:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
always better to have a broad-based tax
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
for everything is it always better to
 
04:39:36.769 --> 04:39:36.779 align:start position:0%
take two dollars per thousand and give
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
it back to the affluent instead of
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
giving that back to towns so that they
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
can take care so that the people there
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
don't have to increase their property
 
04:39:46.970 --> 04:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
taxes you know people have talked about
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
they want more people to move into the
 
04:39:51.948 --> 04:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
state where are we gonna put them we got
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
new houses
 
04:39:56.750 --> 04:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
I mean really yeah uh we we could not
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
possibly have the kind of influx that
 
04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
um Colorado was having or or that uh
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
Florida's having we don't have anywhere
 
04:40:07.250 --> 04:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
for them to go so you know it's and the
 
04:40:08.510 --> 04:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
reason we don't have anywhere for them
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
to go is because the cost of building
 
04:40:14.270 --> 04:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
houses and and many other factors you
 
04:40:15.770 --> 04:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
know too much to get into
 
04:40:18.170 --> 04:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
but the other thing I think we need to
 
04:40:20.570 --> 04:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
realize is that
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
having a larger poor population
 
04:40:26.690 --> 04:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
costs money
 
04:40:28.970 --> 04:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
we all know that right Health and Human
 
04:40:30.890 --> 04:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
Services has to pay more
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
we know that our special edu Ed
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
population goes up we've got all kinds
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
of kids we have children of of addicts
 
04:40:44.930 --> 04:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
um you know coming into the schools I
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
can tell you the kids the teachers
 
04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
in the conville district are being hit
 
04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
and bitten
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
I this these kinds of problems have have
 
04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically we have greater
 
04:41:03.650 --> 04:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
child poverty than we used to much more
 
04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
we really need to pay attention to the
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
other to our constituents most of our
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
constituents or your constituents
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
um and these these people are important
 
04:41:19.490 --> 04:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
too and uh honestly
 
04:41:21.530 --> 04:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
um you know of all the people who are
 
04:41:25.250 --> 04:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
here I I certainly am someone who is
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to continue to pay the tax if you
 
04:41:32.090 --> 04:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
pass 192. and I am willing to pay the
 
04:41:34.368 --> 04:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
tax because I think it will make my
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
future and my society and New Hampshire
 
04:41:36.958 --> 04:41:38.090 align:start position:0%
future and my society and New Hampshire
better

04:41:38.090 --> 04:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:41:49.368 --> 04:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
not a question but uh I just wanted for

04:41:52.730 --> 04:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative fellows wasn't here
 
04:41:55.730 --> 04:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
earlier on she had to leave for another

day here today
foreign

04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:26.570 --> 04:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you again Madam chair and members
 
04:42:28.128 --> 04:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Catherine
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
lawhead with the tax foundation and I'll
 
04:42:32.510 --> 04:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
be testifying in a neutral capacity on
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 100.
 
04:42:36.050 --> 04:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
as you know the phase out of the
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax uh began with
 
04:42:41.930 --> 04:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
the enactment in June of 2021 of the
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
current biennial budget and Implement
 
04:42:46.490 --> 04:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
implementation of that phase out began
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
this month with the rate dropping from 5
 
04:42:53.208 --> 04:42:53.218 align:start position:0%
in 2022 to 4 in 2023 and this
 
04:42:55.128 --> 04:42:55.138 align:start position:0%
legislation would repeal the tax three
 
04:42:56.930 --> 04:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
years earlier than initially planned
 
04:42:59.628 --> 04:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
with repeal taking place next January
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
1st instead of January 1st 2027
 
04:43:05.930 --> 04:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
as a result this legislation would not
 
04:43:08.330 --> 04:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
only end the tax three years earlier
 
04:43:10.190 --> 04:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
than planned but it would also allow
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to keep more of the Returns on
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
their Investments allowing them to have
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
more of that money to reinvest in the
 
04:43:17.580 --> 04:43:18.708 align:start position:0%
more of that money to reinvest in the
economy

04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
economy
 
04:43:20.930 --> 04:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
but in addition to the tax savings they
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
would receive this bill would also spare
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the burden of three additional
 
04:43:28.430 --> 04:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
years of filing income tax forms in New
 
04:43:28.440 --> 04:43:29.810 align:start position:0%
years of filing income tax forms in New
Hampshire

04:43:29.810 --> 04:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:43:32.090 --> 04:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
given that policy makers have already
 
04:43:33.890 --> 04:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
agreed to phase out the interest in
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
dividends tax it makes sense that this
 
04:43:38.270 --> 04:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
body would also work to expedite that
 
04:43:39.890 --> 04:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
phase out to the extent the state has
 
04:43:42.170 --> 04:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
Revenue capacity to do so
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
if the int if the IND tax had already
 
04:43:47.570 --> 04:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
been repealed New Hampshire would rank
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
7th instead of ninth on the state
 
04:43:51.770 --> 04:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
business tax climate index's individual
 
04:43:54.350 --> 04:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
tax component and New Hampshire would
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
rank fifth overall instead of sixth in
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
terms of the overall competitiveness of
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
the state's tax structure so that is
 
04:44:03.530 --> 04:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
definitely something the state can look
 
04:44:07.128 --> 04:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
forward to once the tax is phased out
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
this tax is of course the one policy
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
that is standing in the way of New
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire truly joining the ranks of the
 
04:44:16.190 --> 04:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
other seven income tax free states and
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
as has been noted earlier today on
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
income tax maps and analyzes that my
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
organization and others produce New
 
04:44:25.730 --> 04:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does continue to receive an
 
04:44:27.708 --> 04:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
asterisk denoting that the state does
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
not tax wage and salary income but does
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
continued attacks interest in dividends
 
04:44:31.920 --> 04:44:32.990 align:start position:0%
continued attacks interest in dividends
income

04:44:32.990 --> 04:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
income
 
04:44:35.208 --> 04:44:35.218 align:start position:0%
now Most states that do have individual
 
04:44:37.850 --> 04:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
income taxes do apply that same rate or
 
04:44:40.750 --> 04:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
rates to in interest in dividends income
 
04:44:43.490 --> 04:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire is now unique among
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
states in applying a tax specifically to
 
04:44:47.690 --> 04:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends but not to wage
 
04:44:49.788 --> 04:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
and salary income
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
for many years both New Hampshire and
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
Tennessee received asterisks because
 
04:44:57.170 --> 04:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
both States uh or because Tennessee was
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
one of the states that used to Levy
 
04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
attacks on interest in dividends income
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
only that was known as the hall tax that
 
04:45:04.610 --> 04:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
was phased out by one percentage Point
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
per year reduced from six percent in
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
2015 to 1 in 2020 and then repealed
 
04:45:13.128 --> 04:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
entirely in January of 2021
 
04:45:15.890 --> 04:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
and as a source of Revenue this tax in
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is particularly unstable
 
04:45:20.448 --> 04:45:20.458 align:start position:0%
because revenues are tied to the
 
04:45:22.970 --> 04:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
performance of the stock market so the
 
04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
tax will naturally bring in much more
 
04:45:26.208 --> 04:45:26.218 align:start position:0%
money when the economy is doing well
 
04:45:28.368 --> 04:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
than when it is doing poorly
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
this tax is also a relatively small
 
04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
source of overall revenue for the state
 
04:45:33.788 --> 04:45:33.798 align:start position:0%
bringing in only about
 
04:45:36.530 --> 04:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
156.4 million dollars in fiscal year
 
04:45:36.540 --> 04:45:37.910 align:start position:0%
156.4 million dollars in fiscal year
2022

04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
2022
 
04:45:40.010 --> 04:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
so that amounts to about seven percent
 
04:45:42.410 --> 04:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's tax collections for
 
04:45:43.788 --> 04:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
that year
 
04:45:46.250 --> 04:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note for the bill specifies
 
04:45:49.128 --> 04:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
that repealing the tax in 2024 would
 
04:45:50.650 --> 04:45:50.660 align:start position:0%
yield approximately
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
187.6 million dollars worth of tax
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
savings to taxpayers spread out over
 
04:45:58.970 --> 04:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
multiple years comparing compared to the
 
04:46:00.830 --> 04:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
current plan of phasing out the tax by
 
04:46:02.990 --> 04:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
one percentage Point per year
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
and Expediting that phase out would of
 
04:46:08.448 --> 04:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
course benefit taxpayers but giving
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
ongoing economic uncertainty and a bit
 
04:46:13.128 --> 04:46:13.138 align:start position:0%
of a slowing down of Revenue growth it
 
04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
would be wise for policy makers to take
 
04:46:16.730 --> 04:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
a close look at Revenue projections to
 
04:46:19.128 --> 04:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
ensure Expediting the phase out can be
 
04:46:21.050 --> 04:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
accomplished responsibly but to the
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
extent it could this is definitely a tax
 
04:46:26.270 --> 04:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
that is one of the more harmful in New
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and is one of the taxes most
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
worthy of being phased out
 
04:46:34.570 --> 04:46:34.580 align:start position:0%
so in short this tax would or Expediting
 
04:46:36.890 --> 04:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
Expediting the phase out would reduce
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
tax and compliance burdens for New
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and it would also
 
04:46:43.250 --> 04:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
reduce administrative costs for the
 
04:46:46.010 --> 04:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
state and improve the competitiveness of
 
04:46:48.170 --> 04:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's tax structure so this is
 
04:46:49.550 --> 04:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
a policy change that is well worth
 
04:46:52.490 --> 04:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
considering and I'm happy to take any
 
04:46:52.500 --> 04:46:55.788 align:start position:0%
considering and I'm happy to take any
questions

04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative only
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
has the tax Foundation done any research
 
04:47:09.350 --> 04:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
on the percentage of wealthy people that
 
04:47:11.330 --> 04:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
um earn considerable amounts by
 
04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
investment on who are investing
 
04:47:16.080 --> 04:47:18.250 align:start position:0%
investment on who are investing
[Music]

04:47:18.250 --> 04:47:18.260 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:22.490 --> 04:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
actively and directly in businesses
 
04:47:25.490 --> 04:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
and likely maybe to be in doing that
 
04:47:27.410 --> 04:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
business here though that doesn't always
 
04:47:29.868 --> 04:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
happen either uh
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
as versus the ones who like me just put
 
04:47:36.170 --> 04:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
it in mutual funds
 
04:47:38.090 --> 04:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
and we have no idea where it goes but
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure very little of it stays
 
04:47:42.650 --> 04:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire thank you
 
04:47:44.990 --> 04:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't done a study of that nature
 
04:47:47.090 --> 04:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit outside of our scope
 
04:47:47.100 --> 04:47:48.410 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit outside of our scope
but

04:47:48.410 --> 04:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
um again I think you know interest in
 
04:47:53.090 --> 04:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
dividends taxes are something that
 
04:47:56.690 --> 04:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
people pay regardless of how much income
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
they earn so if you do have above the
 
04:48:02.208 --> 04:48:02.218 align:start position:0%
basic amount of Investments uh you're
 
04:48:04.250 --> 04:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
going to be subject to this tax and so
 
04:48:08.330 --> 04:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
that results in reduced investment you
 
04:48:11.330 --> 04:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
know less income to invest back in these
 
04:48:13.788 --> 04:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
businesses and back in you know
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
consumption or other things that will
 
04:48:20.288 --> 04:48:20.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative roachford
 
04:48:24.288 --> 04:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair just looking
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
at your handout your third bullet point
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
04:48:29.570 --> 04:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
um when you say New Hampshire would rank
 
04:48:31.368 --> 04:48:31.378 align:start position:0%
seventh instead of ninth and then fifth
 
04:48:33.770 --> 04:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
instead of six overall who who is ahead
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
of us
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
what states are ahead of us as far as
 
04:48:36.600 --> 04:48:37.970 align:start position:0%
what states are ahead of us as far as
tax

04:48:37.970 --> 04:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:48:41.810 --> 04:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
the top two are I believe I believe
 
04:48:45.230 --> 04:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
Wyoming and South Dakota are slightly
 
04:48:47.690 --> 04:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
ahead I will have to get you that exact
 
04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
list but usually the state's in the top
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
ten are
 
04:48:56.448 --> 04:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
do not Levy one of the major taxes so
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
that does apply to New Hampshire you
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
know normally if you don't have a tax
 
04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to rank first overall on
 
04:49:07.010 --> 04:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
that component of our index so uh New
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I believe ranks first for
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
sales taxes tied with other states that
 
04:49:13.850 --> 04:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
don't have a sales tax by virtue of that
 
04:49:15.410 --> 04:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
so that helps bring up the state's
 
04:49:18.650 --> 04:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
overall score but you do rank pretty low
 
04:49:20.690 --> 04:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
on some of the other components like
 
04:49:23.090 --> 04:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance taxes and a bit
 
04:49:30.110 --> 04:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you okay uh
 
04:49:35.090 --> 04:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
recognize Greg Moore from Americans for
 
04:49:35.100 --> 04:49:44.570 align:start position:0%
recognize Greg Moore from Americans for
prosperities

04:49:44.570 --> 04:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
committee I appreciate the opportunity
 
04:49:49.010 --> 04:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
to speak here today for the record my
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
name is Greg Moore I am the state
 
04:49:51.890 --> 04:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
director with Americans for Prosperity
 
04:49:55.128 --> 04:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and a lot of what
 
04:49:56.930 --> 04:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
I would have said has already been said
 
04:49:59.690 --> 04:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
so I'll say ditto to what uh some of the
 
04:50:01.490 --> 04:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
folks earlier before me said in the
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
interest of time uh I know it's not
 
04:50:05.090 --> 04:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
going to be snowing tonight but you know
 
04:50:06.288 --> 04:50:06.298 align:start position:0%
that still gives you a chance to get
 
04:50:07.368 --> 04:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
home and probably finish some of the
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
shoveling you might have missed out on
 
04:50:11.990 --> 04:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh but I will say I will say that that
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
there is a two points first of all
 
04:50:17.330 --> 04:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh I've come across a number of the
 
04:50:20.330 --> 04:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
folks who have left the state as a
 
04:50:22.128 --> 04:50:22.138 align:start position:0%
result of this interest in dividends tax
 
04:50:24.650 --> 04:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
I know that the chair and the ranking
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
member member former representative Will
 
04:50:28.610 --> 04:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
Smith he's a great example of somebody
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
who was a New Hampshire resident
 
04:50:32.690 --> 04:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
and it is now Florida resident but he's
 
04:50:34.128 --> 04:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
not really a Floridian because he still
 
04:50:35.810 --> 04:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
Spends His summers in Newcastle but
 
04:50:37.670 --> 04:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
because he lives more than six months in
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
Florida he avoids paying this interest
 
04:50:43.010 --> 04:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax but what we lose uh by
 
04:50:45.110 --> 04:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
having him do that is we lose the
 
04:50:46.970 --> 04:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have him in uh spending
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
instead of eight months here spending
 
04:50:51.410 --> 04:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
five months here and moreover
 
04:50:54.050 --> 04:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
Dan not Dan although Dan there was a Dan
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
involved here but uh will was part of an
 
04:50:58.250 --> 04:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
Angel Investment Group uh one of his one
 
04:50:59.330 --> 04:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
of his colleagues and that was
 
04:51:02.330 --> 04:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire uh but once once
 
04:51:04.128 --> 04:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
will move to Florida
 
04:51:05.330 --> 04:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
he stopped being part of the Angel
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
Investment Group that angel Investment
 
04:51:08.090 --> 04:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
Group mostly invests in new
 
04:51:09.770 --> 04:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based small businesses around
 
04:51:09.780 --> 04:51:11.090 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based small businesses around
funding

04:51:11.090 --> 04:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:51:13.610 --> 04:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
um for a lot of groups to get them off
 
04:51:15.230 --> 04:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
04:51:17.150 --> 04:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
he's not the he's not the only one who
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
who's done this uh we've I've lost
 
04:51:20.930 --> 04:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
frankly a couple of Fairly sizable
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
donors one of whom moved to Tennessee
 
04:51:25.850 --> 04:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
just uprooted not not moved six months
 
04:51:26.930 --> 04:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
of the year
 
04:51:28.850 --> 04:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
to another state but actually uprooted
 
04:51:31.010 --> 04:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
to Tennessee over this about three years
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
ago I wish I could have told him just
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
wait on hold on a few more years we
 
04:51:37.010 --> 04:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
might be able to fix this but when we
 
04:51:39.050 --> 04:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
lose these folks we lose people who are
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
big economic engines this particular
 
04:51:41.810 --> 04:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
person was very big in real estate
 
04:51:44.810 --> 04:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
investment now the good news is with our
 
04:51:46.730 --> 04:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
with our real estate economy there's not
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
no real lack of real estate investment
 
04:51:50.270 --> 04:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but having one more
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
person who's locally based as opposed to
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
one of these International Realty
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
investment trusts I think is something
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
that would have been value for our
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
valuable for our economy the second
 
04:52:01.550 --> 04:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
thing I would say and try to keep this
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
as short as possible is I'd encourage
 
04:52:05.570 --> 04:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
you to take a look at the work on this
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
based on by the beacon Center in
 
04:52:09.410 --> 04:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
Tennessee the beacon Center in Tennessee
 
04:52:12.110 --> 04:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
has done some time looking at the actual
 
04:52:14.810 --> 04:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
overall economic impact as well as the
 
04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
net impact for tax revenues on the
 
04:52:19.550 --> 04:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
elimination of what they refer to as the
 
04:52:22.090 --> 04:52:22.100 align:start position:0%
hall income tax what we call our IND tax
 
04:52:24.410 --> 04:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
but if you go to the beacon Center's
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
website and just and just look up Hall
 
04:52:28.010 --> 04:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
income tax don't don't type interest and
 
04:52:30.530 --> 04:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
dividends type in Hall income tax you'll
 
04:52:32.810 --> 04:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
get some great research in that space so
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
I'd encourage you to take a look at that
 
04:52:36.650 --> 04:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
because because they've already done
 
04:52:39.530 --> 04:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
what this bill proposes to do so
 
04:52:41.090 --> 04:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
um always good to see what other states
 
04:52:43.730 --> 04:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
the results other states have had when
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
you're considering policy before the
 
04:52:48.530 --> 04:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
state so with that I'll close it because
 
04:52:51.470 --> 04:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
I don't want to retread old ground
 
04:52:55.250 --> 04:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:57.410 --> 04:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative Olney has a question yeah
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
could you tell me is that the only state
 
04:53:04.850 --> 04:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
that has looked at the issue of on our
 
04:53:07.128 --> 04:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
wealthy investors in your state
 
04:53:11.110 --> 04:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
investing actively or are they investing
 
04:53:15.708 --> 04:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
uh through mutual mutual funds and ex
 
04:53:18.350 --> 04:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
and IRAs and such thanks for the
 
04:53:20.448 --> 04:53:20.458 align:start position:0%
question uh one of the
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
one of the areas but this has become a
 
04:53:25.970 --> 04:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
really hot uh topic not necessarily
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
because of Tennessee and a whole income
 
04:53:29.868 --> 04:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
tax but because of federal tax policy
 
04:53:32.090 --> 04:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
and assault deduction a lot of these
 
04:53:34.730 --> 04:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
issues have have uh risen up because
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
because a lot of States particularly in
 
04:53:39.050 --> 04:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
New York New Jersey in particular in
 
04:53:41.090 --> 04:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
Connecticut are three that have looked
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
closely into the salt because they have
 
04:53:43.550 --> 04:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of high net worth
 
04:53:45.708 --> 04:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
High a lot of high net worth people who
 
04:53:47.590 --> 04:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
as a result of the salt are seeing
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
substantial federal income tax returns
 
04:53:52.250 --> 04:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
and they're looking for ways to do that
 
04:53:55.250 --> 04:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
I have to be candid I haven't spent too
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
much time looking into that
 
04:53:59.810 --> 04:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
um but I know I know that that that is
 
04:54:01.010 --> 04:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
something that's taken place within
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
those three states and you and you might
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
want to look to those three states as to
 
04:54:06.770 --> 04:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
how they're approaching this but it's
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
again that's as relate to federal tax
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:21.410 --> 04:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
all right we'll recognize Dennis Hall
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:27.240 --> 04:54:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
chair

04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:54:30.410 --> 04:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to make a couple of
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
points I promise to keep it brief
 
04:54:34.730 --> 04:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
we at ATR believe the taxes should be
 
04:54:38.330 --> 04:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
flatter simpler more visible and lower
 
04:54:40.250 --> 04:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
than they are today and this bill would
 
04:54:42.650 --> 04:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
accelerate the process to accomplish all
 
04:54:45.410 --> 04:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
all four of these goals at once
 
04:54:45.420 --> 04:54:46.190 align:start position:0%
all four of these goals at once
um

04:54:46.190 --> 04:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:48.050 --> 04:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
an under discussed aspect of the
 
04:54:49.490 --> 04:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax is that
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
dividends can be considered a form of
 
04:54:55.010 --> 04:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
double taxation most Dividends are paid
 
04:54:57.050 --> 04:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
by larger corporations who have
 
04:54:58.850 --> 04:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
shareholders and are also subject to the
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
business profits tax these profits are
 
04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
taxed at the entity level and then taxed
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
again when they're paid out to
 
04:55:06.350 --> 04:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
individuals in the form of dividends so
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
essentially the state is taxing these
 
04:55:10.610 --> 04:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
these profits more than once so by
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
passing this bill New Hampshire can
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
limit the taxation of corporate profits
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
to the corporations themselves and leave
 
04:55:18.350 --> 04:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
individuals free to save and invest and
 
04:55:20.090 --> 04:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
to that point in a high inflationary
 
04:55:22.010 --> 04:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
environment getting rid of this tax
 
04:55:24.110 --> 04:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
should be a top priority even when
 
04:55:26.270 --> 04:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
inflation is low there are limited
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
options for the middle class and even
 
04:55:30.170 --> 04:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
the low class to protect the value of
 
04:55:32.270 --> 04:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
their hard-earned dollars they have to
 
04:55:34.010 --> 04:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
buy bonds or they have to buy stocks or
 
04:55:35.690 --> 04:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
they have to find some way to generate a
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
return on investment and this tax is
 
04:55:39.410 --> 04:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
nothing more than
 
04:55:41.690 --> 04:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
um a five percent or however much the
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
rate will be next year in the year
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
Beyond on those returns that they're
 
04:55:48.050 --> 04:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
relying hang on to make ends meet and
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
most Americans are foregoing this sort
 
04:55:51.530 --> 04:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
of long-term investment they're not
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
saving they're racking up credit card
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
bills to get by and hoping for the best
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
that inflation drops again and hopefully
 
04:55:59.330 --> 04:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
it will but this bill would leave
 
04:56:01.128 --> 04:56:01.138 align:start position:0%
residents free to keep a hundred percent
 
04:56:03.410 --> 04:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
of their earnings on saving an
 
04:56:04.670 --> 04:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
investment and it would incentivize
 
04:56:06.890 --> 04:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility both in the short
 
04:56:09.350 --> 04:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
term and the long term maximizing the
 
04:56:11.208 --> 04:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
ability of New Hampshire rights to be
 
04:56:11.218 --> 04:56:12.350 align:start position:0%
ability of New Hampshire rights to be
inflation

04:56:12.350 --> 04:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
04:56:14.810 --> 04:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
and finally I'll just say the no income
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
tax state movement is large and growing
 
04:56:19.550 --> 04:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
and it's best for New Hampshire to join
 
04:56:21.770 --> 04:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
this group without restrictions as soon
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
as possible four states will eliminate
 
04:56:25.310 --> 04:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
their income tax over the next several
 
04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
years 11 states have passed legislation
 
04:56:30.110 --> 04:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
to cut their income tax rate in 2022
 
04:56:32.930 --> 04:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
alone 23 States now have a flat tax
 
04:56:34.910 --> 04:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
including Idaho and legislators are
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
considering bringing down this rate in a
 
04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
Litany of different states in 2023 and
 
04:56:41.810 --> 04:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before the census data
 
04:56:43.310 --> 04:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
and pretty much any studies that you'll
 
04:56:45.050 --> 04:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
look at show that Americans are moving
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
to these states part of it might be the
 
04:56:49.250 --> 04:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
warmth I grew up in Florida and it's
 
04:56:51.170 --> 04:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
absolutely gorgeous I wish I was there
 
04:56:54.708 --> 04:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
right now but a large part of this is
 
04:56:56.390 --> 04:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
also have to do with their with their
 
04:56:58.368 --> 04:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
with their business friendly environment
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
and friendly tax environment for
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
individuals and families so with that I
 
04:57:04.010 --> 04:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
will leave it there and any questions
 
04:57:06.050 --> 04:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
are appreciated thank you very much
 
04:57:06.060 --> 04:57:08.930 align:start position:0%
are appreciated thank you very much
questions

04:57:08.930 --> 04:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:57:14.208 --> 04:57:14.218 align:start position:0%

04:58:13.610 --> 04:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Lauren O'Sullivan from
 
04:58:15.948 --> 04:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue
 
04:58:18.530 --> 04:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
I just handed out a fiscal note quick
 
04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
guide in regards to the fiscal note that
 
04:58:24.650 --> 04:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
we prepared for the house bill 100 and
 
04:58:26.570 --> 04:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
the department does not have a position
 
04:58:29.030 --> 04:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill and we're here to address
 
04:58:41.448 --> 04:58:41.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:43.730 --> 04:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
representative Schoenberg
 
04:58:45.650 --> 04:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:58:48.530 --> 04:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
and thank you dra representatives for
 
04:58:49.788 --> 04:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
04:58:51.650 --> 04:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
going back to my question to
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
04:58:56.208 --> 04:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
does the LLC
 
04:58:58.610 --> 04:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
pay any taxes
 
04:59:03.410 --> 04:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
of money that's invested into them or
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
bet BPT any
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
yes so uh New Hampshire taxes the
 
04:59:12.590 --> 04:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
business taxes for New Hampshire taxes
 
04:59:16.250 --> 04:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
on an entity level basis so that's
 
04:59:18.288 --> 04:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
different from the federal taxation
 
04:59:22.250 --> 04:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
where it passes on a pass-through basis
 
04:59:24.050 --> 04:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
um so the LLC
 
04:59:26.090 --> 04:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
Kevin conducting business activities in
 
04:59:28.368 --> 04:59:28.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will be subject to the
 
04:59:37.850 --> 04:59:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:40.730 --> 04:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative homie
 
04:59:42.530 --> 04:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:59:44.990 --> 04:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
just I've got another question a bigger
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
one but on following up on this one we
 
04:59:51.050 --> 04:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
have something in the law that exempts
 
04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
the LLCs from paying
 
04:59:58.010 --> 04:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
attacks do you know what it is
 
05:00:01.490 --> 05:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
business taxes well I indeed no I and D
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
uh for Indy taxes uh
 
05:00:08.570 --> 05:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
the LLC will be subject to the Indy tax
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
if it's not represented by transferable
 
05:00:11.638 --> 05:00:13.128 align:start position:0%
if it's not represented by transferable
shares

05:00:13.128 --> 05:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
shares
 
05:00:13.138 --> 05:00:14.510 align:start position:0%
shares
right

05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:00:15.948 --> 05:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:00:15.958 --> 05:00:17.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
oh

05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:00:20.570 --> 05:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
and and if if I could on that one
 
05:00:22.850 --> 05:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
sorry on
 
05:00:27.170 --> 05:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
I know a guy in my community that when I
 
05:00:29.208 --> 05:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
talk to them about business which is a
 
05:00:33.368 --> 05:00:33.378 align:start position:0%
while back now he had 25 llc's
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
about a third of them I think were
 
05:00:40.250 --> 05:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
were convenience stores attached to gas
 
05:00:40.260 --> 05:00:42.650 align:start position:0%
were convenience stores attached to gas
stations

05:00:42.650 --> 05:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
stations
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
do you combine
 
05:00:50.090 --> 05:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
an LL guys different llc's when they're
 
05:00:52.010 --> 05:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
the same kind of business or in general
 
05:00:53.810 --> 05:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
or what do you do
 
05:00:58.490 --> 05:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
about about that so from a business tax
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
perspective we'll
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
we will consider if all those LLCs are
 
05:01:06.770 --> 05:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
unitary or not and if they're unitary
 
05:01:10.610 --> 05:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
and if uh the one of the aspects of
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
filing a combined return is that the
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
business entities also conduct business
 
05:01:18.288 --> 05:01:18.298 align:start position:0%
within and without New Hampshire if the
 
05:01:20.448 --> 05:01:20.458 align:start position:0%
business activity if the business entity
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
is not doing meaning that uh requirement
 
05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
then each of the business entities will
 
05:01:30.730 --> 05:01:30.740 align:start position:0%
have to file its own uh business return
 
05:01:35.628 --> 05:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
from an IND perspective uh each LLC will
 
05:01:37.390 --> 05:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
be looked at
 
05:01:40.128 --> 05:01:40.138 align:start position:0%
individually whether that LLC is
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
represented by transferable shares or
 
05:01:43.910 --> 05:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
non-transferable shares
 
05:01:46.850 --> 05:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a different question
 
05:01:49.368 --> 05:01:49.378 align:start position:0%
but maybe if there's someone else
 
05:01:50.810 --> 05:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
let's just see if anyone else has a
 
05:01:50.820 --> 05:01:52.550 align:start position:0%
let's just see if anyone else has a
question

05:01:52.550 --> 05:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:01:55.128 --> 05:01:55.138 align:start position:0%
seeing none go ahead
 
05:01:57.170 --> 05:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure whether I should be talking
 
05:02:01.970 --> 05:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
with you or the Comptroller but on I
 
05:02:06.170 --> 05:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
want someone maybe lbao someone besides
 
05:02:08.050 --> 05:02:08.060 align:start position:0%
me to
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
look at the percentage growth rates of
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire from say 2004 because
 
05:02:19.550 --> 05:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
before that we just finished changing
 
05:02:23.208 --> 05:02:23.218 align:start position:0%
the tax rates on to
 
05:02:23.218 --> 05:02:26.090 align:start position:0%
the tax rates on to
22

05:02:26.090 --> 05:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
22
 
05:02:28.550 --> 05:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
05:02:31.850 --> 05:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
the percentage growth in the country and
 
05:02:37.270 --> 05:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
because we have this
 
05:02:43.490 --> 05:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
very variable understanding of whether
 
05:02:47.690 --> 05:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
we are behind the eight ball when we're
 
05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
coming out of recessions
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire and believe me in
 
05:02:55.970 --> 05:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession we we were three
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.250 --> 05:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
two years maybe but I think it was three
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh and I believe it was that way in 10
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
which was pretty small as well so it was
 
05:03:10.730 --> 05:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
just a blip
 
05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative if you're referring I
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
mean I don't mean 10 I mean
 
05:03:17.810 --> 05:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
um two thousand
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative you're referring to a GDP
 
05:03:22.430 --> 05:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire GDP growth rate oh we we
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
don't have that data yeah no I'm talking
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
about the revenues oh Revenue growth
 
05:03:31.750 --> 05:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:36.110 --> 05:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I was brought up here over 26 years
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
by we're always late coming out of
 
05:03:40.490 --> 05:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
recessions but we were late going into
 
05:03:42.890 --> 05:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
them so I want to see what the evidence
 
05:03:45.350 --> 05:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
is and we can't really get comparable
 
05:03:47.230 --> 05:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
evidence before
 
05:03:51.250 --> 05:03:51.260 align:start position:0%
2004 because we changed a lot of taxes
 
05:03:56.270 --> 05:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
in 1999 to 2001.
 
05:04:03.350 --> 05:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
we do have uh Revenue data statistics uh
 
05:04:06.650 --> 05:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
or uh for the past 10 years we actually
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
compiled that I believe we do have that
 
05:04:11.690 --> 05:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah so in in the uh in the
 
05:04:13.850 --> 05:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
upcoming house race it means
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
presentation uh there would be a
 
05:04:16.798 --> 05:04:17.868 align:start position:0%
presentation uh there would be a
uh

05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:20.570 --> 05:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
one of the slides would have the uh a
 
05:04:25.070 --> 05:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
10-year Revenue Trend yeah historical
 
05:04:27.410 --> 05:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
if I could
 
05:04:31.390 --> 05:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
follow up this only goes back to 2012
 
05:04:36.830 --> 05:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
which was the for Most states the end of
 
05:04:39.410 --> 05:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
the recession
 
05:04:43.490 --> 05:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
and or 11 even what's what's the
 
05:04:45.650 --> 05:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
earliest year that you're looking to oh
 
05:04:48.830 --> 05:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
four oh four okay
 
05:04:52.430 --> 05:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
it could be O2 I I can't remember how
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
long it it took for us to stabilize
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
after we changed all of the rates of
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
everything and added a few taxes
 
05:05:04.670 --> 05:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
are you looking at all tax all taxes
 
05:05:10.730 --> 05:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
against GDP is that uh no looking at all
 
05:05:15.410 --> 05:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
taxes uh in New Hampshire versus in New
 
05:05:19.730 --> 05:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's it must be in somebody's statistics
 
05:05:23.160 --> 05:05:24.530 align:start position:0%
it's it must be in somebody's statistics
somewhere

05:05:24.530 --> 05:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
05:05:26.690 --> 05:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
we probably will not have the tax
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
revenue data for other states
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
seems to have an idea and I would also
 
05:05:33.770 --> 05:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
just submit be clear we're not all on
 
05:05:37.128 --> 05:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
the same fiscal year I know
 
05:05:39.410 --> 05:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
05:05:41.628 --> 05:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is just some
 
05:05:44.330 --> 05:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh representative on me what
 
05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't the like the Great Recession 2008
 
05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make sense to go to 2008 I'm
 
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
not saying I'm just thinking if we
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
change the tax code in 99 to 2001 we
 
05:05:58.730 --> 05:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
would have a good Runway of information
 
05:06:03.170 --> 05:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
coming into the 2008 recession I maybe
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
that would be better data
 
05:06:08.690 --> 05:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
yeah well we would get better data if we
 
05:06:13.730 --> 05:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
kept it at 0.7 or 08. so yeah maybe 08
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
is when we first started to see it in
 
05:06:19.070 --> 05:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
our revenues right okay and and if I can
 
05:06:21.288 --> 05:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
ask a question to representative of all
 
05:06:23.628 --> 05:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
me your first question seemed like a
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
really good question but I couldn't hear
 
05:06:26.810 --> 05:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
the answer and I was wondering if we
 
05:06:29.090 --> 05:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
could repeat that sequence because I'm
 
05:06:31.730 --> 05:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
hoping to learn something yeah about the
 
05:06:31.740 --> 05:06:35.930 align:start position:0%
hoping to learn something yeah about the
LLCs

05:06:35.930 --> 05:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:40.970 --> 05:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
whether whether the llc's what the llc's
 
05:06:45.650 --> 05:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
are exempt from in in business taxes and
 
05:06:47.690 --> 05:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends taxes and I
 
05:06:50.208 --> 05:06:50.218 align:start position:0%
believe what you said is that for
 
05:06:54.410 --> 05:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
business taxes on they are not exempt
 
05:06:57.970 --> 05:06:57.980 align:start position:0%
in any way but in the
 
05:07:01.010 --> 05:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
they are exempt if they
 
05:07:08.208 --> 05:07:08.218 align:start position:0%
have don't have transferable shares or
 
05:07:12.530 --> 05:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
do have transferable shares so um
 
05:07:15.530 --> 05:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
the uh Partnerships and llc's that are
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
not represented by transferable shares
 
05:07:21.890 --> 05:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:24.770 --> 05:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
EF if I could ask yeah I'm sorry could
 
05:07:27.730 --> 05:07:27.740 align:start position:0%
you repeat that I can't hear you
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:34.970 --> 05:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and LLCs that are shared
 
05:07:37.850 --> 05:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
that are represented by uh represented
 
05:07:39.948 --> 05:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
by not represented by transferable
 
05:07:43.430 --> 05:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
shares are subject to the IND
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
R yes
 
05:07:47.890 --> 05:07:47.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:50.990 --> 05:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
all right this is obviously confusing we
 
05:07:52.850 --> 05:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
will come back to these topics again
 
05:07:54.770 --> 05:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for being here so
 
05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
we'll let's I don't have any other pink
 
05:07:57.360 --> 05:07:58.490 align:start position:0%
we'll let's I don't have any other pink
cards

05:07:58.490 --> 05:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
cards
 
05:08:01.128 --> 05:08:01.138 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else would like to speak
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the public
