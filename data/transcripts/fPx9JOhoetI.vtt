and then discuss whether or not we can
 
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to the full
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee on the disposition of Center
 
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 align:start position:0%

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
this is not a public hearing we're not
 
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
going to ask ask people to come up to
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
the table and testify on the bill what
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
we are going to do is we're going to ask
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
a series of questions and ask people in
 
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
the who are assembled here with us today
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
and we thank you for being here
 
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
if you feel you would like to answer the
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
question please raise your hand and then
 
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
we'll invite you to the front table
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
to answer the question
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
now it's possible that more than one
 
00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
person would want to
 
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
offer an answer to the question
 
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
we will call on more than one person if
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
we feel that the question hasn't
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
adequately been answered or if there's a
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
possible more than one answer let's put
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
so that's the way we'll we will proceed
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
this morning as you can see we have five
 
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee plus one
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
other member of the sdne committee
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
the members of the subcommittee are to
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
my right
 
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
representative James Summers
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
myself reference to my left
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative JD Bernardi
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative Kat McGee and
 
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Corman and
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas is here as a
 
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
interested member of the committee
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
as you know all members of the committee
 
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
are invited to attend
 
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work sessions
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
and we may during the course of the day
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
have other committee members pop in and
 
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.230 align:start position:0%
have other committee members pop in and
out

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.150 align:start position:0%
out
so

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
with that as an introduction are there
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
seeing none let's get right to it
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
so I have two lists of questions here
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
one developed by
 
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
each of our caucuses the majority in the
 
00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
minor minority caucus and so what we'll
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
do here is we'll ask I'll ask a question
 
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.070 align:start position:0%
do here is we'll ask I'll ask a question
from

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
this list in my right hand first and
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
then we'll ask a question from this list
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
in my left hand second
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll get our answers
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
from the interested parties that way
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
so the first question on the list is
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
should the department of energy issue
 
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
rfps instead of utilities is there
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
anybody here who would offer an answer
 
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:23.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
Dan from the Department of energy
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
please state your name and uh who you
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
represent yep Dan Phelan uh represent
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
the department of energy it has been our
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
position that the department should not
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
issue the rfps for a few reasons the
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
primary of which is resources and after
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
that is expertise the utilities have
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh issued rfps in other states and have
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
a familiarity with the process the
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
department is not familiar with the
 
00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
day-to-day detail of the RFP and would
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
not be able to under current Staffing
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
provide the adequate support that an RFP
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh does anyone need
 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
clarification or elaboration on that
 
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.889 align:start position:0%
clarification or elaboration on that
answer

00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
does anyone else out there like to
 
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.730 align:start position:0%
does anyone else out there like to
respond

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
good morning Molly Connors for the
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
record New England power generators
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
Association I can speak to the practices
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
in other states in the state of Rhode
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
Island and in the state of Connecticut
 
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I misspoke in the state of
 
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
Connecticut in the state of
 
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it is the Department of
 
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
energy resources which is the equivalent
 
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
energy that issues the RFP they assure
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
that they have the resources the the
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
department has the resources to go
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
through this by ensuring that the
 
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.690 align:start position:0%
through this by ensuring that the
applicants

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:10.700 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
sign agreements that allow third parties
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
like ISO New England to review the
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
applications and the information in the
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
RFP the state policies have done this
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
because they find that the conflict of
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
interest that the incumbent utilities
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
have is so strong that they need to make
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
sure that there is a system in place
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
that doesn't inadvertently tip the
 
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
scales even further for the incumbent
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
utilities this is because the incumbent
 
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
utilities often have an affiliate a
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
company that is proposing
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
proposing a solution to the RFP similar
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
to their competition so our ever source
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
for example may be in a position where
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
it is it has a project that's competing
 
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
for the RFP along with other companies
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
and we've seen that in Massachusetts in
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
addition to having the the government
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
agency in support with ISO New England
 
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579 align:start position:0%
and the utilities review the responses
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
to the rfps they have an independent
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
evaluator that's brought in that
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
monitors the behavior of the utilities
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
when they do it
 
00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.579 align:start position:0%
and have it answer any questions thank
 
00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:19.550 align:start position:0%
and have it answer any questions thank
you

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.130 align:start position:0%
you
okay

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
forget about the audience which is
 
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
strange since I sang for so long you
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
would think I would know get the mic on
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
um this point about having a third party
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
um be responsible or an independent
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
um expert that would be able to help
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
with the RFP process is one that had
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
been brought up last week and
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
um I actually had a zoom yesterday with
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
Mike Licata of eversource around
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
um how that could be inserted into the
 
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
RFP section
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
um and so I we have some proposed
 
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
language which is electric distribution
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
utilities shall engage an independent
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
third party to perform a cost-benefit
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
analysis of any agreements received in
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
response to our request for proposals
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
such analysis should be provided to the
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
commission as part of a utilities
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
petition for approval of any purchase
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
power agreements resulting from the RFP
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
process so this independent third party
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
would be to evaluate the rfps to bring
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
that expertise but there's also a piece
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of developing the rfps that we
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
think there probably should be language
 
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
around as well
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to mention that
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
that's something we had discussed and
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
eversource was certainly you know happy
 
00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:52.019 align:start position:0%
to do that they
 
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:54.980 align:start position:0%
um we're fine with that Edition
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
specific thank you for uh investigating
 
00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
that where in the
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
language of the bill with this new
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
language so section two is the purchase
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
power agreements request for proposals
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
right yeah and we just created a section
 
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.610 align:start position:0%
right yeah and we just created a section
five

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:21.410 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.449 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
is there any further comment
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
Mr Phelan
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
you can stay where you are Molly since
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
you also have a comment
 
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
that said him uh respond first because I
 
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
saw his hand first and then you next
 
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
great so the department did have some
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
concerns with that provision uh so to
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
say that the department is not putting
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
out the RFP doesn't mean that the
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
department is not going to have a role
 
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:56.540 align:start position:0%
in oversight
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
we intend to fully represent the
 
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
interests of New Hampshire repairs
 
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
before the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
if and when a contract is brought
 
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.470 align:start position:0%
if and when a contract is brought
forward

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh there is a bit of concern about
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
changing who the onus is on so the
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
utility should in bringing forward this
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
contract make a good case for why it is
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
a good deal for New Hampshire rate
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
payers hopefully they will do so by
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
presenting a benefit cost analysis and
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
if they do not the department is ready
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
with the funding in section four current
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
section 4 to attempt that
 
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.710 align:start position:0%
section 4 to attempt that
um

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
so there's concern that this would be
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
redundant because the department would
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
then go out and hire its own Consultants
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
to perform some of this similar work and
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
the cost of this potential new third
 
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:52.940 align:start position:0%
party would be recovered from ratepayers
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
increasing overall costs of the of the
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
contract so those are our concerns oh
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
okay there's one more hand in the back
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
from Tom Franz who would like to make a
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
quick comment could you come forward Tom
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
and then Molly I'm going to let you
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
speak after that I just want to add
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
something that uh
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
the department also wants to point out
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
that we we end the Office of Consumer
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
Advocate have input into the RFP ahead
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
of time before it's issued so it's not
 
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
like there's no oversight in utilities
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to issue this RFP without any
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
any input from us or from the office
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and I would think that
 
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
a utility that
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
she always say it doesn't pay any
 
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
attention to our comments in the RFP
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
would probably find it even a rockier
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
road when they come in with the proposal
 
00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:46.370 align:start position:0%
road when they come in with the proposal
later

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yes go ahead turn on your mic
 
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
please yes
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
um so in section three I'm sorry it's
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
section two which is purchase power
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
agreements but then it's um
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
numeral three
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
um there's also an adjustment there
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
with language after the word consumer
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
advocate so I'll just read you the
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
suggestion and this is so there's
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
Communications both ways so it starts
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utilities shall
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
consult with the Department of energy in
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer Advocate on
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
all issues related to such requests for
 
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
proposal prior to issuance including the
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
criteria and scoring to be used in the
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
review process to the request for
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
proposals and then the next sentence is
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
the department and the office of the
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and then inserted is
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
shall engage an independent third party
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
with utility purchase power agreement
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
expertise to help provide any such
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
consultation within 60 days from the
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
date each draft requested for proposal
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
is provided for its review so the part
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's inserted is just shell engage a
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
third part an independent third party
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
with utility purchase power agreement
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
expertise to help
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
so the idea is that on the front end it
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
will be the department and the consumer
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
Advocate who would be working with a
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
consultant to determine how the RFP will
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
be crafted that goes out and then on the
 
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
back end it would be in the utilities
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
hands to hire an independent third party
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the rfps and make a
 
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation in terms of the cost
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis to the consumer and all
 
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:30.620 align:start position:0%
of that was added with the idea that
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
reliability and cost were the two things
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
we were trying to solve for or the
 
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:37.700 align:start position:0%
primary things that
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
we heard were at issue and without
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
without those two pieces I think then
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's a lot murkier how how we get there
 
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.390 align:start position:0%
and um
so

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any comment on the
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we add language to
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
suggest that the department and the
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate shall engage an
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
independent third party
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
uh as described in the language Molly
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
you go first and then Mike Licata might
 
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
have a comment yeah I would like to
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
speak to something that um Mr frond said
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
which is that this would automatically
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
increase costs for ratepayers I disagree
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
with that I think it's possible for the
 
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
developers who are proposing these
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
projects to put a portion or a fee on
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
top for the application this is not an
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
uncommon practice we do it when we try
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
to register our cars and ISO New England
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
for example does you know charge
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
applicants for the mere benefit of
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
entering the the queue so I think that
 
00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
this would be considered the cost of
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
business and something that doesn't need
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
to necessarily go on the rate payers who
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
again have no say in the matter I would
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
also just like to offer some
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
observations we've made from
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which is about to issue
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
its fourth RFP for offshore wind or
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
large-scale Canadian Hydro for the first
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
three times they they did have the
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
utilities sort of do all of this work
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
and the independent evaluator found in
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
multiple cases is that the utility in
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
this in this case ever Source but I
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
don't think it's fair to single out one
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
incumbent utility in that case the
 
00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:15.419 align:start position:0%
independent evaluator found troubling
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
Behavior by the incumbent utility as
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
they attempted to make the to tip the
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
scales in favor of their own projects so
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
in the case I'm thinking of one was
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass and one was an offshore
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
wind project so I think it's almost
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
unfair to put the utilities in this
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
position because there is so much money
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
at stake both were ratepayers and for
 
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
the utilities it's almost setting them
 
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
up to fail and I do appreciate that um
 
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
that states don't necessarily have the
 
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
expertise or the resources in-house
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
which is why in Massachusetts it's the
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
department of the Attorney General and
 
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
the department of energy resources that
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
issues the RFP and the requests for the
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
independent evaluator and with that I'll
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
go sit down thank you
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you those are good comments
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that Molly
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
so Mr locata did you have a comment to
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
make about the proposal to
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
require a third party independent third
 
00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:09.970 align:start position:0%
require a third party independent third
party

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:09.980 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
investigator or evaluator to look at
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
these rfps
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
I I do just a little bit of background
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
um and not speaking to the provisions
 
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
that representative McGee said related
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
to the Department of energy and the
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate they can represent
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
their own agencies uh the language uh
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
around the utilities engaging uh a
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
third-party independent an independent
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
third party to conduct the cost benefit
 
00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:44.660 align:start position:0%
analysis uh
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
eversource thought that this might be
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
helpful uh language it was consistent
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
with some of the language that
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative McGee was suggesting
 
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
around the other agencies and really the
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
goal of that is to have a third party
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
who is assisting in that evaluation that
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
these are extremely complicated analysis
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
that have to go on you're essentially
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
um you know doing a predictive analysis
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
of uh you know the energy markets going
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
out multiple years
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
um you know there's there's a lot of
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
computation that goes into that and
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
having a third party to to review to
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
conduct that analysis we thought was
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
both helpful
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
um in terms of expediency but also
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
helpful in terms of really
 
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.649 align:start position:0%
helpful in terms of really
providing

00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:35.659 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
Assurance to the commission that it's
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
not just eversource saying hey this
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
one's the lowest cost that's higher cost
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
and I just also point out that uh in the
 
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:51.370 align:start position:0%
and I just also point out that uh in the
evaluation

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:51.380 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
the If This Were to pass with that
 
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
language it would be an independent
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
third party which would do the analysis
 
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
of sort of the future looking energy
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
market cost and then you're just
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
benchmarking each contract against that
 
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:10.100 align:start position:0%
so what is the cost and the
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
term of each one so again trying to be
 
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
clear transparent and I think the the
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
additional language that that analysis
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
in full uh is required to be provided to
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission as part
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
of a petition for approval that all
 
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
parties could review again it it feels
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh like a strong
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
transparent an appropriate process and I
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
appreciated Mrs Connor's clarification
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
that the utilities had actually been the
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
entities that had issues these rfps in
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
the past in Massachusetts
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't be you would be in favor
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
of the language suggested by
 
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGee I think it's a
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
helpful clarification I think it it
 
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
provides some additional strength to the
 
00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
process and uh to Mrs to miss Connor's
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh suggestion of of an application fee
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh to go along with it I think that's an
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
interesting concept I want to obviously
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
think it through a little bit more but
 
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's potentially some
 
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
some value in that for sure
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
do you think that language would be
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
redundant to the language and
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
section four that has the department of
 
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:25.700 align:start position:0%
energy also uh hiring Consultants
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
presumably independent third-party
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
Consultants to evaluate the RFB is it
 
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.510 align:start position:0%
Consultants to evaluate the RFB is it
redundant

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.590 align:start position:0%
redundant
um

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
so I I do not think that it's redundant
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
and I will let obviously the department
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
speak for itself as well as the OCA
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
about how they would engage in this
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
process but I think that you know
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
obviously the utilities are one party
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to engage an independent
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
consultant to do an analysis
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission excuse
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
me the consumer Advocate and the
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
department of energy will be additional
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
parties providing rigor and review to
 
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
this process uh both at the front end of
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
the development of the RFP but also when
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
the utilities uh if they receive
 
00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299 align:start position:0%
appropriate responses back petitioned
 
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
for approval by the commission you'll
 
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:19.940 align:start position:0%
now have those uh as they are today
 
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
those agencies being a party to those uh
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
filings and obviously they can provide
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
review and rigor and I presume you know
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
it is very common for them to hire
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
Consultants to to assist in that so it's
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
really having multiple set of eyes
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
looking at as was pointed out uh
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
significant contracts that represent a
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
question Mr Corman representative Corman
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.990 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
so

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing is the prospect of doe
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
hiring an independent third party and
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
then the utilities hiring an independent
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
third party
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
um presumably two different independent
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
third parties do you foresee any problem
 
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
in finding
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
two independent third parties who are
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
truly independent of each other and each
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
competent to do these analyzes
 
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
so I I don't believe so
 
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:18.419 align:start position:0%
um I think there are different
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
consulting firms that specialize in this
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and I I would suggest that the the
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
role of each are are slightly different
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
um so one right now the language is that
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
the department May hire Consultants to
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
Aid in the development of the RFP so
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's putting together the the actual
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
request for proposal language that goes
 
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.769 align:start position:0%
request for proposal language that goes
out

00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
um so then
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
the RFP gets issued
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
um responses come back the utilities
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
receive those responses the utilities
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
engage in independent third party to
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
conduct a cost-benefit analysis of those
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
responses prior to submission to the
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
commission for uh approval so it's it's
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
sort of different steps in the process a
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
different venue but I think it all adds
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
those are good points but we have to be
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
careful to avoid paralysis by analysis
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
um we can have these rfps evaluated
 
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
before they're issued we can have them
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
evaluated after they're issued and
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
eventually you know the process is going
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
to take so long that people just throw
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
up their hands and walk away so we have
 
00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
to be careful but those are good points
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
so there was something there that Mr
 
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
locata pointed out that I think it Bears
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
repeating the sections that we are
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
talking about are about the development
 
00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
of the RFP itself they are not about the
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
analysis of the bids or the the sort of
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
approval process that comes after so
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
um having an independent third party
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
look at these things would be a lot more
 
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
useful if it's looking at what builds
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
came forward is the utility acting
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
prudently those asking those sort of
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
questions rather than how is the RFP
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
structured and what are the details of
 
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.730 align:start position:0%
structured and what are the details of
that

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:24.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
so just clarifying those pieces of the
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
bill great thank you
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay so we spent close to 15 minutes on
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
question number one
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
we have about 20 Questions here so this
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you oh
 
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
there we go I just wanted to add some
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
information that I think um uh Bears
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
consideration on this question
 
00:27:59.450 --> 00:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm here on behalf of the community
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
power Coalition of New Hampshire a joint
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
power agency of 33 jurisdictions within
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
the state our 32 Municipal members
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
represent about 22 or more than 22
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
percent of the state's population
 
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
um what I wanted to say is that a couple
 
00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:18.059 align:start position:0%
things within a year or two we are
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
expect to become the either the largest
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
or second largest supplier of
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
serving more than half of all default
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
service customers across the state we
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
have already contracted for state of the
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
art uh software as a service and
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
consulting services to do precisely this
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
type of evaluation we'll be recovering
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
those costs from our ratepayers the
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
company that we've contracted with for
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
the next three years Ascend analytics
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
does precisely this type of project
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%

their power Sim and portfolio planning

software to evaluate competitive
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
procurements and I just mentioned that
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
because we will have that capability in
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
place to help evaluate uh such proposals
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to suggest that
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
the door should be open through the puc
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
process to let other load serving in any
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
new hampshires for which the utility
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
would be entering into long-term
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
obligations on their behalf essentially
 
00:29:35.289 --> 00:29:35.299 align:start position:0%
for all rate payers to be able to also
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
evaluate responses to the proposal and
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
that I I appreciate your point we don't
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
want uh paralysis by analysis but we're
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
you know feel that we're a significant
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
stakeholder and and we already have the
 
00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:51.539 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art software and consulting
 
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
services to do that type of evaluation
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
and in fact our own business plan calls
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
for us as we develop our credit uh uh
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
investment grade credit rating which is
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
typically occurs after about three years
 
00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
of operation to be able to do this kind
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
of long-term Contracting ourselves on
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
behalf of our customers
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
thank you quick question are you
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
suggesting that
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
there is additional language needed in
 
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
the bill to allow
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
organizations such as your own
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
to enter into these or to create these
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals right now it's
 
00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
restricted to invest around electron
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utilities
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
well we're we're no I'm asking for an
 
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
opening to be able to help look at
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
comment on the RFP in the first place
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
there was a suggestion maybe it maybe
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's in there now that there could be at
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
least comment on the proposed RFP
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
language before it goes out but more
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
importantly uh to be able to uh also do
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
our own evaluation and be able to enter
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
that as testimony in the adjudicated
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
proceeding we're not necessarily opposed
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
to this concept of this common
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
Contracting for everyone
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
um but we are concerned that it results
 
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
in the the best most appropriate
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
projects be selected and I realize that
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
may require non-disclosure agreements
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
and things like that but that that seems
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
all all doable when you have a a party
 
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
with an interest in the case so I think
 
00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419 align:start position:0%
I don't have specific language but the
 
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
concept is uh to to allow at least a
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
load serving entities that Supply New
 
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and residents and
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to also be involved in the
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
evaluation of RFP responses
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
so the legislation already contains the
 
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.210 align:start position:0%
so the legislation already contains the
language

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
within this period the utilities May
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
solicit public comment well that's you
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
permissive do you think that should be
 
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.850 align:start position:0%
permissive do you think that should be
so

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.070 align:start position:0%
so
yes

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
in terms of the RFP
 
00:31:57.779 --> 00:31:59.450 align:start position:0%
in terms of the RFP
process

00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
and and just one comment you know I I
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
think um I I don't disagree with the
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
um uh in in the first instance the
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
utilities are in a better position than
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
the department of energy uh for for the
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
Consulting as has been proposed here I
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
just Just one thought you know it says
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
the utilities shall contract with an
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
independent uh validator if they're the
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
Contracting party that that vendor is
 
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
accountable to them so it's it's a
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
little tricky to say that they'd be
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
truly independent because
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
because the utility would be directing
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
them as a consultant working on behalf
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the utility so I'm just I'm just not
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
sure quite how
 
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
how you make it independent I think doe
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
and OCA can hire an independent
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
validator because because they don't
 
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
have their only stake is in looking for
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
the public good in the consumer interest
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
so the language we're talking about does
 
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
apply to the uh the department and the
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer Advocate not to
 
00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:03.299 align:start position:0%
the utilities okay so okay thanks for
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
that clarification let's move on to
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
um so that we can have some hope of
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
getting through the day here without
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
wearing everybody out
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
next question is about the 20-year
 
00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:19.070 align:start position:0%
next question is about the 20-year
Horizon

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
Horizon
 
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
for contracts under this legislation we
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
actually have two uh questions about
 
00:33:25.799 --> 00:33:26.889 align:start position:0%
actually have two uh questions about
this

00:33:26.889 --> 00:33:26.899 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
one is is a 20-year Horizon the right
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
length of time for contracts for
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
cost-effective deals
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
does a long-term contract help or hurt
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
the deal making and the current energy
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
spot Market would anybody like to
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
comment on that question
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
I believe the language in the in the
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
legislation says up to 20 years doesn't
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
specify 20 years but can be as long as
 
00:33:59.169 --> 00:33:59.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
that was precisely my point that the the
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
language is for up to 20 years we do not
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
know the most effective length of
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
contract going into this so it is
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
certainly possible that a 10-year
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
contract uh incense the the kind of
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
resources that can Bill uh bit into this
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
and and provide energy through this we
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
just don't know that right now so 20
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
years is a pretty standard term for a
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
long-term power contract and we're not
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
looking to limit our options based on
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
the contract length
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else want to comment
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity I just
 
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
wanted to state that what we have heard
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
from developers across the board is that
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when it comes to cost
 
00:34:56.109 --> 00:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
of capital that a longer contract almost
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
universally results in lower cost
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
financing and so there's a direct
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
correlation between longer term
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
contracts and lower lower cost financing
 
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
which as we laid out in our testimony on
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is can be a large driver of
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of the the levelized cost of
 
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
energy for for high Capital cost
 
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
projects so I would encourage the
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
committee not to reduce the length and
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
as Mr Phalen laid out if a 10-year
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
contract is more is more cost effective
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
developers are free to bid that in as
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
part of the RFP
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
okay representative Thomas
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so I just have one question
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
and and I don't know the answer to this
 
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.150 align:start position:0%
and and I don't know the answer to this
but

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
it could be up to 20-year contract
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
we have a society right now that we seem
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
to change things every week things
 
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
change very quickly up and down spikes
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
and drops and so forth
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
what can be done to ensure that when you
 
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
do this contract
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
20 years in today's time is a lifetime
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
things can change in five years it could
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
change for the worse how do you do
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
something where you don't get trapped
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
into a 20-year nightmare that's that's
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
my question is isn't there any concern
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
over that
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone have a comment on that
 
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.670 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone have a comment on that
question

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
our consumer Advocate Mr Grace
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay I can't resist taking up the bait
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
first of all let me just say I I support
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 54 I I didn't testify at
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
last week's hearing but and I'm eager to
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
do whatever the subcommittee in the
 
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
committee feels is necessary to make the
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
bill as good as it can be so that it can
 
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
be sent to the governor for his
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
signature uh representative Thomas I
 
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
think the answer to your question to be
 
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
frank is nothing I mean that's that is
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
the rub right that's that the whole idea
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
of a 20-year contract is you lock in an
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
obligation for 20 years that gives the
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
developer the certainty that it needs is
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Evans Brown just pointed out to
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
invest the capital and borrow the money
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
that it needs to move forward but it
 
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
locks ultimately the rate payers in for
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
that period and and if if you're worried
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
about the potential adverse consequences
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
of that uh I I commend you because that
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's a legitimate issue but you know
 
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:27.380 align:start position:0%
it's always that trade-off between
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
certainty and uh and risk I guess I mean
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
and and I think ultimately we need a mix
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
of long-term and short-term commitments
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
so that we do our best to uh hedge all
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
of our risks I hope that's a somewhat
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
you want to follow it go ahead thanks
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um and I and I agree my my concern
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
is focused on the fact that
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
that's like a old way of doing business
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
uh things that you know the contracts
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
have been that way for a long time we're
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
entering a period time now where things
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
are changing quickly and the the
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
paradigms are are being mixed and
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
changed and wrapped around and so I'm
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
just kind of curious if there's any if
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's a new way of thinking of how we
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
can get these things done like that I
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
just don't want to see as as technology
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
changes as it will change within the
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
next couple of five years I don't want
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
to see us get involved in a 20-year
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
contract where that where now we're
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
dealing with old old technology in
 
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
today's terms two years is old so that
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
that was my concern
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
you have a comment down to that uh I I
 
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339 align:start position:0%
share that concern but I I guess we
 
00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
can't we we can't invent a new flavor of
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
contract law uh technological change has
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
always been a reality uh we are locked
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
into certain Technologies now that we
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
continue to rely on it is a problem and
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
I I guess I I'm
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh my perspective on that is that as we
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
confront more and more uncertainty the
 
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
things that we can do to hedge against
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
those uncertainties become in a sense
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate that a related
 
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.890 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate that a related
question

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
about limits
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
is why was the limitation of 2 million
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours imposed in this
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
legislation what factors were considered
 
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
in defining this limitation does anybody
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
have any comment on that
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
sure so the the Department's goal in the
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
2 million megawatt hour
 
00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
limit was to limit how how much
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
out-of-market actions we are taking
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
because I think it's it's important to
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
this represents a a change in New
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's state policy
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
so to to sort of to speak about the ways
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
that things have been done for the past
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
20 years uh New Hampshire has
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
participated in a Wholesale Electric
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
markets and used those to drive cost
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
decisions to drive investment decisions
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
in the region this bill is a recognition
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
of the limits of those markets that is
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
not to say that the markets themselves
 
00:40:35.579 --> 00:40:37.030 align:start position:0%
not to say that the markets themselves
are

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
unjust to use a regulatory term but the
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
that this 20 hedge is recognizing that
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
sometimes these markets produce outcomes
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
that hurt rate payers and really get to
 
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
the get to the heart of pocketbooks so
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
the this is aimed at 20 of New
 
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's load we chose that because
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
it represents and balance between
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
so the two million megawatt hours
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
represents 20 percent of the state's
 
00:41:12.839 --> 00:41:15.050 align:start position:0%
represents 20 percent of the state's
load

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
load
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
and said roughly does that
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
answer the committee's questions
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's questions about that
 
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.190 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's questions about that
issue

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.870 align:start position:0%
issue
okay

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on so we had
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions the next question actually
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
came from both of our lists
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
and this question is can we require
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
performance incentives
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
from these ppas
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
so that uh if if reliability is one of
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
the goals of of these ppas should they
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
include some kind of a penalty for
 
00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.329 align:start position:0%
include some kind of a penalty for
non-performance

00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
anybody have a
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
a potential ad you want to elaborate on
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
the question representative McGee
 
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.250 align:start position:0%
the question representative McGee
well

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
um I know it was on both of our lists as
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
you said so I um actually have some
 
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
language that I was working trying to
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
figure out where it would be inserted
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
into the bill
 
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
um on that and what basically it comes
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
down to is sharing the risk
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
um away from just the the rate payer and
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
sharing that risk with performance
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
incentives for meeting projections
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
and on the generator side penalties for
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
non-performance during Peak demand
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
periods to protect rate payers from
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
demand price spikes and to promote you
 
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
know delivery of reliable service so I
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
know that those are both common parts of
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreements I don't know
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
anything about them I don't purport to
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
be an expert but I thought we could
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
include language
 
00:42:55.089 --> 00:42:55.099 align:start position:0%
I I added it to
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
letter e under number three which is
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
also in that section two of request for
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
proposal so I don't have the numbers on
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
my version that I was editing so I can
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
have a clean coffee I can just
 
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.770 align:start position:0%
have a clean coffee I can just
thanks

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
okay point you to the
 
00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:20.099 align:start position:0%
so were you proposing to add this
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
right before section four yeah here
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
right there yep so it would be on line
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
nine page three
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh letter e
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
so it would say any other factors
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
necessary to determine whether the
 
00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
agreement is just unreasonable and in
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
the public interest such as does the
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
contract contain performance incentives
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
for meeting cost projections and
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
Generator penalties for non-performance
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
during Peak demand periods to protect
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
rate payers from demand price spikes and
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
promote delivery of reliable service
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
so it's just uh sort of an add-on of any
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
other factors that we might want to
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
consider but I think if again if the
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
goal is to try and make sure that the
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
ratepayer doesn't Bear all the risk for
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
um any deviation from the performance in
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
the contract and the then the
 
00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:14.579 align:start position:0%
performance metrics positive and
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
negative have to be shared between
 
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.190 align:start position:0%
negative have to be shared between
um

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
between the utility the distribution
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
utility and the generators who are
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
so essentially this would be a
 
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.670 align:start position:0%
so essentially this would be a
requirement

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
for the commission to investigate as it
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
was reviewing the agreements under this
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
section for me the easiest thing to do
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
was add it under any other factors
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
necessary because I didn't know where
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
else to put it logically but
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
um I already sent this over to OLS so
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
there should be a you know a copy of an
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
unapproved Amendment which we can
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
circulate to our group hopefully before
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
the end of our
 
00:44:58.569 --> 00:44:58.579 align:start position:0%
session today
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
incorporating just this change or others
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
do um well the other ones we discussed
 
00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:04.849 align:start position:0%
do um well the other ones we discussed
so

00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
um okay I know the hardest part is to
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
figure out how to amend the actual
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment with changes so I went in and
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
tried to work on it within within the
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
bill so we would have some language
 
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
because I thought it would make it
 
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.349 align:start position:0%
because I thought it would make it
easier

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
easier
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
okay any comments on the suggested
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I would recommend striking the
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
word Peak and here's why I think that
 
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
the performance obligation should be for
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
any hour of any day and there's a good
 
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
reason for that as you may be familiar
 
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
ISO New England and its wholesale
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
electricity Market has a capacity a
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
capacity market and so when you in that
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
capacity Market is there to make sure
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
that resources that accept money from
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
ratepayers perform whenever and however
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
the iso calls to dispatch they're and if
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
you fail to perform under the capacity
 
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
obligation the generator or the whatever
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
the resource is
 
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
pays a penalty if it doesn't show up
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
the conditions that have triggered that
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
we've only had two conditions since the
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
iso initiated paper performance in 2015
 
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
or so the iso has only seen two
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
circumstances when paper performance was
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
triggered both of those were on holidays
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
one was on Labor Day weekend when a
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
there was a fault on the system a large
 
00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
generator in Boston tripped offline most
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
of us were at a barbecue right that was
 
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
the first paid performance in history
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
the second was on Christmas Eve or the
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
sixth day of Hanukkah is someone
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
recently reminded me of 2022 and most of
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
us were not paying attention to our ISO
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
New England apps I think as we see the
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
grid changing sort of the point you were
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
making before representative Thomas
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing Behavior patterns change
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
the the proliferation of solar across
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
New England is totally changing load
 
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
shapes and I think that it's important
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
to realize that as the technology
 
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
changes the load shapes are changing and
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
when we historically have expect did
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
tight conditions and the grid is not a
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
predictor for the future and so I think
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to consider the peak
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
because so many charges are the the
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
utility customers are exposed to so many
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
charges related to the peak but the risk
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
to the rate Pairs and the risk to us
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
just as end users is not limited to the
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
peak so I would just strike Peak say if
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
we expect you to perform and especially
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
if the iso is calling for you to perform
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
you got to perform and that moves the
 
00:47:37.849 --> 00:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
risk away from the rate Pairs and onto
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
the generator and the other generators
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
that are in the market thank you
 
00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:43.550 align:start position:0%
that are in the market thank you
okay

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.510 align:start position:0%
okay
good

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
all right Mr chairman yeah Mr
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
um so I know I made it well known the
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
other day when we heard the uh the
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this about the risk of
 
00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
the rate payers and how I was concerned
 
00:47:59.890 --> 00:47:59.900 align:start position:0%
about that and looking at this
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
particularly these two questions I'm
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
after reading the bill through and I was
 
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:06.740 align:start position:0%
talking about equal skin in the game
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
looking at page three line 13 if we were
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
able to change that may to a shell
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
so that the
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
an investor-owned electric distribution
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
utility shall sell such purchase energy
 
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
and environmental attributes in the
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market in the manner to
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
minimize costs and maximize benefits to
 
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
rates pairs I believe that would put
 
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
scan the game on both sides but I'd like
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
to know your opinion on that thanks
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's a complex one and I know
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's really important to the utility and
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
to community power
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and so I I don't you know that my
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
concern I'm here representing the
 
00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
generators that are already in the
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
market so for us this is 20 of the
 
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
market that we can no longer compete for
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
and so that's my skin in the game in
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
that regard I will say when it comes to
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
energy Arbitrage it's really complicated
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
I use in my former job I I worked at ISO
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
New England and one of my territories is
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
in Vermont which you guys know is all
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts and there have been
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
changes to Market rules that have just
 
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
thrown their contracts upside down and
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
so I think it can I think that they're I
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
think it's very risky to prescribe how
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
and basically the utility should be an
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
energy broker on behalf of end users I
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
think maybe permissive and I'll leave it
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
to um others but you know permissive
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
language that maximizes the the benefit
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
to the rate payer might be the best way
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
to go but again that's really for
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
Community power and competitive
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
suppliers who are essentially energy
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
trading desks I mean a lot of these
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
companies are arbitraging in
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar markets on behalf
 
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
of the rate pairs so from the point of
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
view of the from the generators it's
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's immaterial but I I do think we
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
observe complex very complex markets and
 
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
prescriptive I would I would be per
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'll defer
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
okay Mr locata actually has a comment
 
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:16.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I was actually asked this
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh same question if eversource supported
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
that change from the May to a show I
 
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
think by representative Wendy Thomas and
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate we are fine with that
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
change we understand
 
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
um the concern that uh I believe
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
Community power has stated but others as
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
well that the utilities could kind of
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
shift back and forth yeah maybe we will
 
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
use it for default service and then if
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
pricing goes a different way we'll sell
 
00:50:50.329 --> 00:50:50.339 align:start position:0%
it into the market
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
um that's certainly not our intent uh
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
our intent would be we would make a
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
filing and that is how we would uh for
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
cost recovery going forward so changing
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
that from a May to a shall uh I think we
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
certainly don't object to and
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
um just on the
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
um pay per performance language uh you
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
know representative McGee had mentioned
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
that to me and
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
um I I think there's certainly some
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
value in that obviously you won't be
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
careful and cautious with the language
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
that you use you don't want to
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
um uh inadvertently uh you know cause an
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
issue I think uh Miss Connor's actually
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
made a good point about uh the reference
 
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579 align:start position:0%
to Peak and whether that was appropriate
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
so just to say interesting concept and
 
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's worthy of additional
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
thought and maybe some review of the
 
00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:45.069 align:start position:0%
thought and maybe some review of the
language

00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:48.380 align:start position:0%
okay to follow along on
 
00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:52.619 align:start position:0%
representative Summers question about
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
how do we treat rate payers
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:02.339 align:start position:0%
I have a question here that says should
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
the method of utility cost recovery for
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
customer charges be specified in statute
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
for example rate design versus stranded
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
cost recovery right now all it says all
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
credit or charge all distribution rate
 
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
payers the difference between the
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
agreement payments and proceeds through
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
a uniform fully reconciling annual
 
00:52:28.319 --> 00:52:29.930 align:start position:0%
a uniform fully reconciling annual
Factor

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
Factor
 
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
in rates
 
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
do we need more elaboration on exactly
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
how that cost recovery goes anybody have
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
I do
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
um I I would suggest that well a couple
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
things one is
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a long-term hedge it's a
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
physical hedge of saying we're going to
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
contract for the output of some new
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
generation resource and uh that's on
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of all rate payers so it does
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
make sense to recover if the benefit if
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
we structure so the benefits we've got
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
all rate payers
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
um or the net costs if it ends up 10
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
years out a new technology like modular
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
nuclear comes along and it's much
 
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
cheaper than we can find that we've
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
contracted for something that's too
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
expensive and we just have to live with
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
it because that was our hedge uh you
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
know back in 2024.
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
um but that being said I I think it's
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
important not to get this conflated with
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
distribution cost
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so I would suggest some direction
 
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
that might make sense is that this be in
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
a assuming a contract is entered into uh
 
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
that it be recovered as sort of a common
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
supply cost that's applied to all rate
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
payers uh but it maybe has its own line
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
item that goes along with Supply but
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the common
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
hedge that was you know Common Supply
 
00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
hedge I'm not sure exactly what you call
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
it but I don't think it makes sense to
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
have it go into a distribution rate for
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
instance one other thought on that is
 
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility that the utility
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
a utility we go through this whole
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
process expend a fair amount of money to
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
to do the RFP the evaluation the
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory process and then it gets
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
turned down and then what happens so so
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
one thing that could be said in the
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
statute is that all these costs rather
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
than just saying
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
they're instantly recovered from
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
everyone that they become a regulatory
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
asset that the utility accrues these as
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
a regulatory asset if if it is a
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
contract goes forward those costs get
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
approved as part of the the supply
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
contract so it's part of that supply
 
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.370 align:start position:0%
contract so it's part of that supply
cost

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
um or if it's not approved then that be
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
able to be recovered through the
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery charge which all
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
the utilities still have because that's
 
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
effectively what it would be would be an
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
expense that they incurred uh and and it
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
and it got stranded because there was no
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream to pay for it and so it
 
00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:02.579 align:start position:0%
goes into stranded cost recovery that
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
question Mr representative Corman right
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
so so just to be clear you're you're
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the costs not go into
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
the distribution costs at all that they
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
be charged separately either through the
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
energy supply cost for the rate payers
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
who are getting default service
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
or as a stranded cost well no for for
 
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
all so if if like if it was Community
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
power is your supplier
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's an additional charge or credit
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
on your bill that's the common Supply
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
component for this 20 percent although
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
it may or may not be 20 of our our load
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
at that point but but but it would be
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
proportioned out to everyone based on
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours delivered so it is just
 
00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:56.660 align:start position:0%
based on the the amount of power
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
distributed to everyone
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
obviously it's by utility because this
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
is not actually Statewide it's utility
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
by utility where this may or may not
 
00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.950 align:start position:0%
by utility where this may or may not
occur

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative McGee so I think
 
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
we're some of the questioning is coming
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
in is that we heard from various folks
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
that there was a concern that folks who
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
were not on default service would also
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
be on the line for this distribution
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
charge and so I think we were I also was
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
trying to throw in nuanced language
 
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
um when I spoke with Mr locata about
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
that concept and so can you just say
 
00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
something about that because it's I took
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
notes on what you were saying and it
 
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
um you're just saying if it is not
 
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.510 align:start position:0%
um you're just saying if it is not
um

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
if it is not pulled into the
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
distribution charge which would be
 
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:50.450 align:start position:0%
distribution charge which would be
um

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
an incongruent way to represent it on
 
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
the bill right yeah so everyone sort of
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
benefits from that Supply being used on
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
the system and everybody so can you just
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the proponents uh position
 
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:09.980 align:start position:0%
on the bill that this this is
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
in part because
 
00:57:12.839 --> 00:57:14.390 align:start position:0%
in part because
um most

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
um most
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
um the way
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
most power supplied through through
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers or the utility
 
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
default Services is somewhat short term
 
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
it might go out three or four or five
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
years but my understanding is that for
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
some projects
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
for example it's you know I think it's
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
worth asking what kind of projects might
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
qualify in this and it seems like the
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
two major ones are offshore wind
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
which may not always perform at
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
precisely at the peak but we know that I
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
think the modeling shows that does
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
offshore it produces on a daily basis
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
because there's always some wind
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
offshore and and including in the
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
wintertime so that's one possible Source
 
00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
another is a long-term contract maybe
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
with Hydro Quebec which might involve
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
transmission upgrades
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
um in in in those cases even the
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
transmission upgrades to connect New
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
Generation that would also include some
 
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
of the you know offshore wind for
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
instance uh it is appropriate that those
 
00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
get rolled into that price because the
 
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
policy is long then if New Generation
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
needs to interconnect you include that
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
interconnection cost for that particular
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
unit you know in their cost
 
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
um uh so so you know in some sense it
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
it might make be nice if this was as the
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
bill originally imagined uh uh
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
introduced uh confined to default
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
service rate payers but but but the
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
reality is that's an unknown quantity
 
00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
and I understand why eversource wouldn't
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
want to do this just for default service
 
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.750 align:start position:0%
want to do this just for default service
customers

00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
customers
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
um so if it's structured so that
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefits or net costs flow to everyone
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
then then it makes sense not to confine
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
it to that there is something else I
 
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
want to mention at some point I don't
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
know if it's among your questions but
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I I do support sort of moving the May
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
to Shell
 
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
um well just just slow down a second
 
00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.089 align:start position:0%
um well just just slow down a second
here

00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
um in the existing bill it does say that
 
00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:13.700 align:start position:0%
the utility shall recover any privilege
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
incurred cost related to complying with
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
the section through distribution rates
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
so it all it does say distribution rates
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
specifically I think the commission
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
should even be given more leeway
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
um and they could be given direction
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
that they can recover it through
 
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
non-by-passable charge but whether that
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
charge you know uh it doesn't it doesn't
 
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:35.579 align:start position:0%
make sense that it needs to be hidden so
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
to speak in the distribution rate
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
because it is a supply hedge that's one
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
thought the other thought is back on
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
your previous questions about Shell
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
versus May uh purchased energy and any
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes into the
 
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:52.140 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
the point I want to mention and and I we
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
I can come back to this later if it's
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
one of your questions is that there is
 
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
not really a wholesale Market certainly
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
not one run by ISO New England for
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits for uh
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes my
 
01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:11.339 align:start position:0%
understanding is that most wrecks get
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
traded through private Brokers or
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
private trading desks which are not
 
01:00:16.559 --> 01:00:18.530 align:start position:0%
private trading desks which are not
transparent

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's and in fact when the utilities
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
either purchase wrecks or when they
 
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
project the cost of future wrecks such
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
as Unitil did in their proposal for 4.99
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar array uh to be treated as
 
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
a load reducer they those those are not
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
disclosed those are considered uh
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
competitively sensitive data so my
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
concern is how will we know how what
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
does it mean to sell wrecks into the
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market when there it just
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
means it's being sold at wholesale and I
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
want to suggest something that I think
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
might make sense because if we end up
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
with a project that produces wrecks like
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
offshore Windwood why not just take all
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
the wrecks produced over the course of a
 
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
calendar year and a portion the actual
 
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
wrecks out to all load serving entities
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in proportion to the
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
total load served by that entity over
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
the same calendar year this is possible
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
because like for instance for this
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
calendar year year 2023
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
Rex can still be procured after the
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
first of next year and they don't get
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
reported and sort of they don't have to
 
01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
be settled and reported until July 1st
 
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the following year so there would be
 
01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
actually have time to know what the
 
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
wrecks produced by the project were and
 
01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
a portion amount to all load-serving
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
entities in proportion to the load and
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
then they can use those either for
 
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
compliance or if they don't need them
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
they can sell them and and use that to
 
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
offset other costs for supplying those
 
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
cost customers but it would be a way to
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
minimize cost because if you're selling
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
them at wholesale through a broker or
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
trading desk there's going to be
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
significant transaction costs which sort
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
of devalue those wrecks and to the
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
extent we have a PPA that buys Rex for
 
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years why not deliver those
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
wrecks directly back to New Hampshire uh
 
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
rate payers you know indirectly through
 
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
the load serving entity that otherwise
 
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
has to acquire them for those rate
 
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.109 align:start position:0%
has to acquire them for those rate
payers

01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
payers
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
interesting idea it's a fairly
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
significant expansion of this build so
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
maybe we would want to consider that as
 
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
a separate bill at a later time maybe I
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
um anybody else have any comment on that
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
concept or or the concept of
 
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.130 align:start position:0%
concept or or the concept of
making

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
cost recovery more transparent
 
01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate Mr below's comments and I
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
think there are sort of two different
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
sections of the bill that are getting
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
referenced there that that do two
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
different things so
 
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.890 align:start position:0%
different things so
um

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.510 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
on page three lines 18 and 19 credit or
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
charge all distribution rate payers the
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
difference between the agreement
 
01:03:23.569 --> 01:03:23.579 align:start position:0%
payments and proceeds through uniform
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
fully reconciling annual factor in rates
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a reference to all
 
01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:32.339 align:start position:0%
distribution rate payers there but that
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily at least in our mind
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
mean that they would be recovered
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
through the distribution charge on
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
customers bills uh quite frankly our
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
assumption is that these would be
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
treated as some of the other long-term
 
01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:48.059 align:start position:0%
contracts that the company currently has
 
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
which are recovered through separately
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
through the stranded cost recovery
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
charge so it would be a separate item or
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
in this random cost recovery charge so
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
not sort of just buried in distribution
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
rates uh which pay for the distribution
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
system and are separate from from
 
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:10.940 align:start position:0%
supplies so uh and the
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
um on page two lines 25 through 26
 
01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:19.140 align:start position:0%
that's C
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
where it says electric distribution
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
utilities shall recover any prudently
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
incurred cost related to complying with
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
this section through distribution rates
 
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
um that was simply talking about the
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
actual administration of the RFP uh so
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
running the process and then selecting
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh selecting you know the appropriate
 
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:42.059 align:start position:0%
response and filing that with with the
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
commission so not the entirety of if a
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
PPA is approved flowing that through so
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
just sort of two different sections
 
01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:53.420 align:start position:0%
doing two different things and I think
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
our uh assumption uh is that the
 
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
commission would treat this as it has in
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
the past other long-term contracts that
 
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
that do not flow in the distribution
 
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
rate itself so distribution rates
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
distribution rate uh it's a slight
 
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
difference there
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
um so I think that was the root of the
 
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.210 align:start position:0%
um so I think that was the root of the
question

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
should it be explicitly stated here
 
01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.670 align:start position:0%
should it be explicitly stated here
that

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
cost recovery would come via stranded
 
01:05:28.849 --> 01:05:28.859 align:start position:0%
cost recovery charges rather than some
 
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
other method
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
if that's going to be the method you
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
assumed would be used should that be
 
01:05:34.799 --> 01:05:35.809 align:start position:0%
assumed would be used should that be
stated

01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
stated
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
we would have no objection to that if it
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
was the committee's preference
 
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anybody else have any
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
Mr cormer representative Carmen thank
 
01:05:48.839 --> 01:05:49.549 align:start position:0%
Mr cormer representative Carmen thank
you

01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:05:49.559 --> 01:05:51.109 align:start position:0%
you
so

01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
when when I look at that that language
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
on lines 26 and 27 of page two it talks
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
about complying with this section
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that we're
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
talking about the same thing when we say
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
this section that's section Roman
 
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
numeral one of the language in the bill
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
the section of the bill that starts on
 
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
line 16 of page one where it says two
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
because that encompasses a whole lot
 
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
more than just Roman numeral one yes so
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
our view
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
is that lines 25 and 26.
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
when it refers to this section
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
um I'm just making sure I'm
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
tying the two sections together as you
 
01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
tying the two sections together as you
said

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.089 align:start position:0%
said
um

01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
is talking about the issuance and
 
01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the rfps
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
so and that is I believe contained
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
within section one uh of the bill and
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
then thereafter the actual cost or
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
credit uh which is obviously the ideal
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
uh outcome of the of the power purchase
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
Agreements are subject to the cost
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
recovery mechanisms uh at the end of the
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
bill so so that is you're reading
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
is matches our reading as well good
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
that that may be the intent but
 
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
technically I think section in a law
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
refers to the entirety of section
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
11 uh starting on page six line 16 of
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
page one I think everything in here is
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
the section Roman one uh concerning rfps
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
I think is technically considered a
 
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
paragraph and all these other things are
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
sub-paragraphs of the section so you may
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
want to say this paragraph if it's
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
intended only for Roman one or otherwise
 
01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
clarified because section I think means
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
the whole uh Roman 11. I'm not uh Arabic
 
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
11. I tend to agree with you I think
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
that's the way legislative language
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
works that it refuses to the refers to
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
body of Statute
 
01:08:22.259 --> 01:08:25.010 align:start position:0%
body of Statute
um

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
delineated by the by the
 
01:08:31.729 --> 01:08:31.739 align:start position:0%
by The Heading so all right let's move
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
on to another question then we've
 
01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.689 align:start position:0%
on to another question then we've
answered

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
answered
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
a suggestion from one of the people who
 
01:08:50.219 --> 01:08:51.470 align:start position:0%
a suggestion from one of the people who
testified

01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
testified
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that this is actually a
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
question should we adopt the suggestion
 
01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:10.940 align:start position:0%
that we replace lines 22 through 25
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
with language that says quote
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
incremental electric energy sources are
 
01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
the new and additional resources
 
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
which as a result of new construction at
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
sites where energy facilities existed
 
01:09:35.329 --> 01:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
prior to January 1st 2023 are able to be
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
provided into the iso regional market
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
for the first time on or after January
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
so the suggestion here is adding some
 
01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
so the suggestion here is adding some
dates

01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
dates
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.689 align:start position:0%
to this
paragraph

01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:06.229 align:start position:0%
paragraph
energy

01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative Corman yeah thank you
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah so what would be added here
 
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
would be just saying uh for the first
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
time on or after January 1st 2023 and I
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
believe the intent of the conservation
 
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
law Foundation there was to say that
 
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
suppose you have a facility that's
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
already running and producing power and
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
then it gets added onto
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
that the interpretation should be that
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
the incremental resources are only the
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
part that got added on to or were added
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay anybody out there have a comment on
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
yeah let's excuse me because this is a
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
bit on the Fly and I'm not sure that I
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
fully understand what the changes but
 
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:20.930 align:start position:0%
fully understand what the changes but
our

01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
our position is that the
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
additional energy
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
is what is the is what is defined as
 
01:11:35.209 --> 01:11:35.219 align:start position:0%
incremental under the current language
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's so I'm not
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
sure what the change
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll have to admit I'm a little
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
okay let's hear what uh
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
um actually had that conversation for
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
what you're saying Mr Phelan
 
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
um and uh came to the same conclusion so
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on then to another
 
01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on then to another
question

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
you seem to have resolved that one
 
01:12:23.209 --> 01:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
yes Miss Hatfield can you uh elucidate
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
on what
 
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
the original suggestion was
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Meredith Hatfield for The
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
Nature Conservancy I think the concern
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
was to try to be clear so that if for
 
01:12:36.659 --> 01:12:38.149 align:start position:0%
was to try to be clear so that if for
example

01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
um the gas plant in Londonderry was able
 
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
to add a megawatt and then bid that in
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
would we want to the entire entire plant
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to get a PPA for all of its
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
output and I'm not sure if this is clear
 
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't mean that they could bid
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
all of their output in for example so
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
you want to restrict it to their
 
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.070 align:start position:0%
you want to restrict it to their
incremental

01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
New Generation output not their existing
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
I thought that was the intent of the of
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
the proposal was to to only allow the
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
incremental not allow an entire facility
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
if it added some incremental to then be
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you know as I read
 
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
the language that's here
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's talking about the result of the new
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
construction is capable of providing
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
additional energy I think it does
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're talking about I
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
don't know see why there's any need for
 
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh additional words to say the same
 
01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.330 align:start position:0%
uh additional words to say the same
thing

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah we may be talking about a
 
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
legal hair split here
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know okay all right let's move
 
01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:58.910 align:start position:0%
I don't know okay all right let's move
on

01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no further comments on that
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
here's a question what kind of rate
 
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
payer protections can the bill provide
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
for joint utility ppas particularly
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
those that involve out-of-state
 
01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:16.070 align:start position:0%
those that involve out-of-state
utilities

01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
do we in New Hampshire
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
want to expose ourselves to
 
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
contracts that involve
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
entities from other states which may
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
have different laws may have different
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
goals may have different issues
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
and if that is the case are there any
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
protections we can build in to these
 
01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.870 align:start position:0%
protections we can build in to these
ppas

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
ppas
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
to protect New Hampshire ratepayers
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
so I I know
 
01:15:03.179 --> 01:15:04.130 align:start position:0%
so I I know
um

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
this provision was uh an important one
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
to Senator Waters and he I believe he
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
spoke to it
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
um I would just say that regardless of
 
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
whether the utilities uh
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh enter into sort of a a joint
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
solicitation with utilities outside of
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or not
 
01:15:29.169 --> 01:15:29.179 align:start position:0%
this is the governing statute
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
it has to whatever response PPA we get
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
back has to conform to to New Hampshire
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
law and New Hampshire statute so it
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
win on you know sort of the criteria in
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that we have which is uh
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
contained you know a through e on page
 
01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
three what the um uh
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
what the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
will be evaluating so if a another
 
01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:01.610 align:start position:0%
will be evaluating so if a another
um

01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
State pulled in environmental
 
01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
considerations or Economic Development
 
01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
considerations or Economic Development
considerations

01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
that would be part of their evaluation
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
that could not be part of our evaluation
 
01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.149 align:start position:0%
that could not be part of our evaluation
so

01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think it would be very
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
and I believe I said this to Senator
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
water is very challenging for a utility
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
to engage in a joint multi-state
 
01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.790 align:start position:0%
to engage in a joint multi-state
procurement

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
um uh using this statute but I again I
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
know that that was something he wanted
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
to keep the door open so just to be
 
01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
clear though
 
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
um it is this law that would govern New
 
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's participation in that
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know when we were
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
reviewing when I was reviewing language
 
01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
and uh we look at the legislative
 
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
findings and purpose which starts at the
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
top of the bill
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways to
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
um Define
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
the emphasis or priorities that the
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
states intends for the moving forward of
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
these types of utility ppas is under
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
number three the development of reliable
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
sources of low-cost I inserted in-state
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
electricity Supply is critical to
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
stabilizing and reducing the cost of
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
electricity in New Hampshire it doesn't
 
01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.010 align:start position:0%
electricity in New Hampshire it doesn't
prohibit

01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
um you know cross state ppas if if they
 
01:17:29.689 --> 01:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
come up it doesn't put you in a straight
 
01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:32.699 align:start position:0%
jacket but it basically says that
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
the thing we're trying to solve for is
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
reliability in state
 
01:17:39.169 --> 01:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
and I believe you said Mr Lucado that
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
you didn't have any problem with adding
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
that um emphasis
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
yeah that's uh that's fair and I think
 
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
um one you know
 
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if there are others who
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
can speak to this uh better than I can
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
one does have to be careful
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
um you as I understand it
 
01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.050 align:start position:0%
um you as I understand it
um

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
you open yourself up to Legal challenge
 
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
if you are just having it sort of an
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
in-state or in-state preference
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
procurement uh what we've seen in other
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
states uh and even if you look at how
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
the state RPS is structured it is not
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
limited to to Simply New Hampshire based
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
um uh generation that it it you run a
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
sort of Commerce Clause issues uh doing
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
so so you just want to be very careful
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
with the references to in state
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
obviously we want the benefits to flow
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
in State uh but the I think the
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
procurement needs to be
 
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
open well again this is just a statement
 
01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
of purpose it's not not part of the
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
Contracting piece
 
01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:45.050 align:start position:0%
Contracting piece
but

01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:46.729 align:start position:0%
but
okay

01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
I want to um I would like to build a
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
little bit on what part of what Mr
 
01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
locata just said as I look think about
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
the regional perspective I was trying to
 
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
think about corollaries in other states
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
you know how often do our distribution
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
utilities or the equivalent you know
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's kind of I think of this as actually
 
01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.189 align:start position:0%
it's kind of I think of this as actually
novel

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
novel
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and so when I think of times when
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
other states have worked together
 
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:27.020 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of of an energy
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
solicitation it has been
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
um it has been done more through the
 
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
transmission system than through the
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
distribution system for example
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Connecticut and Rhode
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
Island issued an RFP I think they
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
literally called it the Tri-State RFP it
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
was about five years ago in which they
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
said they wanted to join together to
 
01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:52.820 align:start position:0%
procure transmission to access wind
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
and the reason they tend to do it that
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
way is because it isn't State
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional when you start working
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
with other states and electrons move at
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
the speed of light minus line loss and
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
friction so I do I I
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
apologize for the halting manner in
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
which I'm speaking because this is a
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
little bit novel and the way I'm
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
thinking about it but it isn't to build
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
on what Mr locata said when you start
 
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
saying out of state it starts to trigger
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
other considerations that might be
 
01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
larger than what the state can control
 
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
you may have an
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
the intent may be to work with other
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
states but it I think that this is
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
something that may warrant
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
um further consideration if you don't
 
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
want to get tripped up on some of the
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
issues Mike mentioned
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
I think it goes to a different part of
 
01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
the bill when you start going outside
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
your borders thank you
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the department would have
 
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
serious concerns with adding that
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
in-state language to the statement of
 
01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.250 align:start position:0%
in-state language to the statement of
purpose

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
um partially because
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
simply the the Electric System is not an
 
01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.610 align:start position:0%
simply the the Electric System is not an
in-state

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
in-state
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
machine and there are plenty of
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
reliability benefits that come from
 
01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
resources that are outside of the State
 
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that's why we're
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
connected to uh Interstate grid
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
um and really we have concerns about
 
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
placing an in-state requirement in
 
01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
general because we want the best deal
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
for ratepayers we we don't want this to
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
be a protectionism sort of thing we want
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
low-cost reliable power and that that's
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
the priority that may be served by an
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
NCAA generator it may not we we don't
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
want to limit this procurement to
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
in-state resources
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
reducing the cost of electricity of
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
which part of the reason was that we had
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
to import more expensive fuel right okay
 
01:21:59.810 --> 01:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
understood we get we get your point all
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
right let's move on new question
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
how does allowing the utilities to do
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
anything other than sell procured Supply
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
into the wholesale Market to get the
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
best rate
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
square with deregulated utilities
 
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
controlling generation assets what
 
01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
guardrails are needed to avoid unlimited
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
state-sanctioned rate payer subsidies
 
01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
a broad question admittedly but you want
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
to elaborate representative McGee
 
01:22:34.729 --> 01:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
I think the shell May on selling into
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market kind of addresses
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the idea that you know if the
 
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
energy that's procured is then put onto
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
the market so that anyone can bid on it
 
01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.990 align:start position:0%
the market so that anyone can bid on it
then

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's solved so
 
01:22:51.229 --> 01:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
um that's I don't know how much more
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
discussion there has to be okay did you
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
want to comment Mr locata or did
 
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
that comment by representative McGee
 
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:01.790 align:start position:0%
that comment by representative McGee
address

01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.930 align:start position:0%
address
okay

01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
we'll move on then next question comes
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
should utilities be allowed to earn a
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
profit just for signing a PPA since the
 
01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
PPA constitutes a debt on their balance
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
sheet until its conclusion
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
um in other jurisdictions the utilities
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
do earn a percentage of the total value
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
of the contract
 
01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
that is not included in this legislation
 
01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:46.940 align:start position:0%
there is no ability for the utilities to
 
01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
earn an Adder on this
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
well I I can tell you what the utilities
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
might like but I think that would
 
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:00.860 align:start position:0%
jeopardize passage of the bill
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
well obviously the whole point of this
 
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:07.100 align:start position:0%
legislation is to incent incentivize
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
create creation of these ppas so the
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
will this be a sweetener that would
 
01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
help encourage utilities to seriously
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
consider entering into these ppas
 
01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.229 align:start position:0%
consider entering into these ppas
um

01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a fair question
 
01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:28.669 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a fair question
um

01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
right now the legislation is is truly
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
enabling there is no requirement for the
 
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
utilities to
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
issue the rfps and then subsequently
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
would it be a sweetener an enticement to
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
do that yes uh I I think that's a fair
 
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
statement that said
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
um again I I think
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh that would jeopardize passage of the
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
bill and I think that the utilities
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
um interest in this is to
 
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
develop new resources to reduce
 
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
long-term costs for customers uh you
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
know ultimately it's it's the utilities
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
name on the bill uh that we get the sort
 
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
of negative response when electric rates
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
double even if it's something outside of
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
our control so I I appreciate the
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
question but again uh we are comfortable
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
with the legislation uh you know as
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
passed by the Senate uh and uh again I
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
think that it would be make passage
 
01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:36.950 align:start position:0%
think that it would be make passage
challenging

01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
Mr Phelan I thought I saw your hand go
 
01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:41.169 align:start position:0%
Mr Phelan I thought I saw your hand go
up

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:41.179 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative McGee wants to make a
 
01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
quick comment
 
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I think
 
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
um you know my background in business
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
they say you get the behavior reward
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
right and I look at getting like a
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
signing bonus or you know everyone gets
 
01:25:57.410 --> 01:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
a trophy if you just create a contract
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
you you get rewarded I don't know that
 
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
that's something that the state would
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
like to incent as much as performance
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
incentives right putting something in
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
that actually is related to whether
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
you're you know sort of delivering on
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
on what you're being you know enabled to
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
deliver so that's the way I would review
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
it is that giving them a percentage just
 
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
for signing a contract you know that's
 
01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:20.870 align:start position:0%
for signing a contract you know that's
before

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
that's before any of the um benefits
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we're hoping to derive from it are
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
actually seen so I think performance
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
incentives make a little more sense but
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's just me Mr Phelan
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
sure so the Department's position on
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
this is is pretty straightforward
 
01:26:36.169 --> 01:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
there's no risk for the utilities
 
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
involved in the outlay of this Capital
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
so therefore they should not earn a rate
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
of return on it that's that's our
 
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
clear perspective
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
good solid Point thank you for that
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
next question
 
01:26:52.679 --> 01:26:56.090 align:start position:0%
next question
whoops

01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
what effect will long-term procurement
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
by utilities have on New Hampshire's
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question kind of
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
open-ended question
 
01:27:17.209 --> 01:27:17.219 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's directly related to
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
the bill but
 
01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.390 align:start position:0%
the bill but
um

01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
I guess my response is
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
to reply with a question which is from
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
the perspective of residential
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
ratepayers what burgeoning competitive
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
energy Market
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh and I I don't mean to be glib but my
 
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
counterparts in Massachusetts and Maine
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
have now both commissioned deeply uh
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
detailed studies that demonstrate that
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers have not
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
benefited and in fact have actually
 
01:27:58.729 --> 01:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
arguably been harmed by what is
 
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
described what that question just
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
described as the burgeoning competitive
 
01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
described as the burgeoning competitive
market

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
Mr below might have an answer to that
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
question well he might answer in terms
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
of the Community power aggregation
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh movement and I guess well I'd be
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
curious to hear what he has to say about
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
that too
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
all right did you have anything else
 
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative McGee that you wanted to
 
01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:28.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:31.139 align:start position:0%
I I think that the point of the question
 
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
was that we just enabled the community
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
power coalition to create some
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
competition in the New Hampshire energy
 
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
market and we're not really sure how
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
it's what kind of you know how it's
 
01:28:44.209 --> 01:28:44.219 align:start position:0%
going to play out but we know that
 
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
people have been
 
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
moving toward it even my town at town
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
meeting this year in March decided to
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
move forward and try and you know get
 
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
under contract by next year so I guess
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
the idea is do we know what we're doing
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
in terms of how that will impact taking
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
20 percent of the load for New Hampshire
 
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.370 align:start position:0%
20 percent of the load for New Hampshire
and

01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:05.450 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know doing what we're doing
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
do we understand how that's going to
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
affect the rest of the market and I just
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
thought if anybody could help answer
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
that that would be a good thing to know
 
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:19.250 align:start position:0%
that that would be a good thing to know
okay

01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:27.020 align:start position:0%
um well if it's
 
01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
our original concern with the bill is it
 
01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
was passed by the Senate is it at least
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
on paper created an opportunity for
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
potential subsidy of utility default
 
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.850 align:start position:0%
potential subsidy of utility default
service

01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
changing that made a shell at least with
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
regard to the energy portion uh you know
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
tends to neutralize that problem
 
01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
um our own we've adopted a portfolio
 
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
risk management policy and regulations
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
and our own policies dual it would allow
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
us to do this kind of long-term hedge at
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
this sort of 20 level of our load
 
01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.990 align:start position:0%
this sort of 20 level of our load
um

01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I I guess if if if it's
 
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:11.219 align:start position:0%
if it's structured in a way uh that that
 
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's clear that um benefits and costs uh
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
pass through to all rate payers
 
01:30:20.209 --> 01:30:20.219 align:start position:0%
proportional to their load uh then then
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat and it's potentially a
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
neutral effect I think the bigger
 
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
question is it's it is putting the
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities back in to the
 
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
business of major power procurement
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
decisions and we have intentionally
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
designed Community power both through
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
legislation and rules and our own RFP
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
and procurement of vendor Partners
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
um to be able to perform this kind of
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
service but not at risk to other rate
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
payers and even our own rate payers
 
01:30:57.770 --> 01:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
would be risk would be limited because
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
if we end up making a Bad Bet and you
 
01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
know in 10 years our Hedges out of the
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
money uh then then
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
um you know customers are always free to
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
leave to go back to utility default
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
service or another competitive supplier
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
which is just why I think it's so
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
important to have the the the
 
01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
you know a really good evaluation up
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
front and and you know part of the
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
software we've contracted for it is
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
stochastic modeling it's based on a
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
model of the entire U.S energy uh system
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
every bulk generator in the whole
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
country all those in New England are
 
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
part of the model so it can model
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds or thousands of different
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
future scenarios with all the different
 
01:31:43.090 --> 01:31:43.100 align:start position:0%
possible variables and start giving us a
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
probabilistic outcome of whether
 
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
particular uh hedge is
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
um likely to to to prove worthwhile or
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.870 align:start position:0%
or not
um

01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
so that so I you know I I still kind of
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
go back to that Renewable Energy Credit
 
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
concern because if this ends up being
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
offshore wind or something else can
 
01:32:07.129 --> 01:32:07.139 align:start position:0%
produce wrecks two million wrecks per
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
year is a lot and if those all go
 
01:32:10.729 --> 01:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
through a broker
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's not going to
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
produce the most value for New Hampshire
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
rate payers so what I'm saying if if
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're Contracting a price for Rex that's
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
part of a deal then then why not provide
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
those wrecks directly to all the loan
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
serving entities in proportion to their
 
01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
load because that would help mitigate
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
the potential damage I I mean my concern
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
is that we'd be out there need more us
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
because we we offer 50 100 renewable
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
we'll want more wrecks than the minimum
 
01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
compliance because because uh some rate
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
payers want that higher renewable
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
content and if if we're getting the if
 
01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
we're paying say 20 a rack for the next
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
um 20 years uh but then those are sold
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
through a broker it could end up costing
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
us 25 to buy them and we're only getting
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know and we're only getting 20
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
in the Brokers skimming that difference
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know in the process or it's not
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
really skimming it's they provide a
 
01:33:10.129 --> 01:33:10.139 align:start position:0%
service by reselling but why not just
 
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
give those wrecks directly so that I'm
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
just just suggesting that one change
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
could be of significant financial
 
01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
benefit and maybe it's worth trying to
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
think through in the next week a way
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
that would allow the puc to consider
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
that decision if if it you're not ready
 
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's a second bite of that apple
 
01:33:34.729 --> 01:33:34.739 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're no it's okay I'm just saying
 
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:39.500 align:start position:0%
that it's it's it's it's it's it's
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
worthy of thinking about definitely
 
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
worthy of thinking about and it is kind
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
of a big change but maybe uh it would be
 
01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
an important enough change to seriously
 
01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.709 align:start position:0%
an important enough change to seriously
consider

01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
for this uh
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
for any amendment that we might
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
end up generating all right let's talk
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
to me seems sort of like the elephant in
 
01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
the room that nobody has talked about
 
01:34:07.739 --> 01:34:08.629 align:start position:0%
the room that nobody has talked about
yet

01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
should only knew or incremental electric
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
energy sources be considered for these
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
ppas or
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
would there be room for existing
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
and Mr Phelan has an immediate answer to
 
01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh that the end of that question
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
complicated things a a little bit I'll
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
just say that we are are not looking to
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
restrict to any subset of technology
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
types at the end of the question talked
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
about uh existing base load renewable
 
01:34:49.199 --> 01:34:51.110 align:start position:0%
about uh existing base load renewable
resources

01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
um we are in opposition to any change
 
01:34:54.239 --> 01:34:55.390 align:start position:0%
um we are in opposition to any change
that

01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
specifies the technology type that would
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
be eligible for this procurement as to
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
new or existing more generally part of
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
the objective of this is that New
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
England has a building new things
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
problem and there is a historic
 
01:35:16.689 --> 01:35:16.699 align:start position:0%
opposition to building anything even
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
you know local opposition to for
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns has not stopped
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
large non-carbon projects from being
 
01:35:27.970 --> 01:35:27.980 align:start position:0%
stopped in their tracks
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
in in general New England needs to build
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
more things in order to provide the
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
reliable service that our ratepayers
 
01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.910 align:start position:0%
reliable service that our ratepayers
need

01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
so new only is an important part of this
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.719 --> 01:35:47.209 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
what if it was existing base load
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
resources didn't specify renewable
 
01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
I'll follow with that we
 
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
another reason for not wanting existing
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
resources is that we do not want to hook
 
01:36:06.169 --> 01:36:06.179 align:start position:0%
rate payers put rate pairs on the hook
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
for the last years of a deteriorating
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
resource so they're
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
are a lot of Market changes going on in
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
New England and with that a lot of
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
resources that may be at risk of
 
01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.390 align:start position:0%
resources that may be at risk of
retirement

01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
we don't want those resources hanging
 
01:36:30.010 --> 01:36:30.020 align:start position:0%
around as an albatross on our ratepayers
 
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
next so so
 
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
that's another reason why we oppose
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
including existing in these bills
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
all right another question here how can
 
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
we help ensure that SB 54 results in a
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
win for rate payers and for the state's
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:00.169 --> 01:37:00.179 align:start position:0%
anybody have a yeah Mr stock has a
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
if you want to answer the prior question
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's okay too okay
 
01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
no you didn't
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty informal process and
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to accommodate everybody
 
01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
because our goal here is to get all the
 
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
ideas on the table that can make this
 
01:37:23.450 --> 01:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
the best build that it can possibly be
 
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
and be acceptable to everybody too sure
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I and and I appreciate that and and
 
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
I and I appreciate the informal aspect
 
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
of this and I guess I did want to speak
 
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
to the to the existing question which
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
was the prior question and you know as a
 
01:37:45.169 --> 01:37:45.179 align:start position:0%
as someone who represents existing power
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
plants that are base loaded that are
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
base load facilities I guess when I look
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
kind of the objectives of this bill and
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
as I heard earlier today
 
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
um one of the major one of the major
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
objectives is to find the best deal for
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
the ratepayer here
 
01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:06.659 align:start position:0%
I think it would be
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you would be remiss not to consider
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
an existing facility if it's already a
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
merchant facility in the marketplace
 
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
that's out there it and perhaps it does
 
01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
have a lower Debt Service because it is
 
01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
an existing facility
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
to consider that sure to not consider
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
that would be remiss if it can provide a
 
01:38:32.209 --> 01:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
benefit to the rate payer I look at it
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
and I I appreciate the concern that we
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
have a quote building problem
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
but if you try to stimulate construction
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
and at the same time ignore potential
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
closures or closures or facilities going
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
down that could benefit rate payers
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
I think you're no further ahead
 
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
um and it wasn't long ago that we had a
 
01:38:57.250 --> 01:38:57.260 align:start position:0%
discussion about the Burgess power plant
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
which In This Very Room and the question
 
01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
came up and I think it was
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas who quite
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
pointedly said
 
01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
so what's next
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
we have a bill a bill here to look at
 
01:39:12.770 --> 01:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
that contract and try to reopen that
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
contract and negotiate it and as a we
 
01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
look at Senate Bill 54 for that facility
 
01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
and potentially some of the existing
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
power plants that as an opportunity that
 
01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
could provide them an OP inability to to
 
01:39:31.129 --> 01:39:31.139 align:start position:0%
bid into this program and at the same
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
time continue to operate and provide a
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
rate payer benefit
 
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
the other upside of this is that for a
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
facility such as that do you really need
 
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
20 years you're not looking at a at a
 
01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:47.219 align:start position:0%
very extended large extended pay down
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
terms on a on a new contract or trying a
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
finance package
 
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
so perhaps this could also facilitate
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the thoughts or
 
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
discussions that you've had already
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
about term in trying to do some
 
01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
structuring of this so that you're not
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
putting all your eggs into a 20-year
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
contract maybe you look at a at some
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
shorter term contracts that could
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
provide some opportunities for a
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
facility that's already paid down some
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
of its debt service already has its
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
interconnection and some of that
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure already in place already
 
01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.530 align:start position:0%
infrastructure already in place already
invested

01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
invested
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
so I think I think that you know to to
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
not consider existing
 
01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
and again I represent a base load
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
facility so to some of the comments
 
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.169 align:start position:0%
facility so to some of the comments
earlier

01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:36.179 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:38.360 align:start position:0%
um that were raised about performance
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
Peak versus performance at any time
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
baseload fits fits that ticket so I I
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
would say that we would Advocate that
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
you would consider
 
01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:53.540 align:start position:0%
looking at this and allowing existing
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
allowing existing facilities
 
01:40:59.209 --> 01:40:59.219 align:start position:0%
to say that a rate payer is going to be
 
01:41:02.110 --> 01:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
saddled with a an old Antiquated
 
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
facility I don't think is a true
 
01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
accurate statement if that facility is
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
already in the market already a merchant
 
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
facility in the marketplace that
 
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
facilities out there bidding in
 
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
operating if it closes
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
that facility is not going to be a a
 
01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
drain on the rape here and if they have
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
a contract and if they have a contract
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
with performance standards already baked
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
into it
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
you have some assurance that if for some
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
reason the facility did fail or did go
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
down there is a performance standard
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
that can protect the rate payers so
 
01:41:42.250 --> 01:41:42.260 align:start position:0%
again I I would just Advocate that
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
existing facilities be considered in
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
this and again looking at the looking at
 
01:41:47.639 --> 01:41:49.250 align:start position:0%
this and again looking at the looking at
the

01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
at the findings and the purpose
 
01:41:54.649 --> 01:41:54.659 align:start position:0%
and kind of with an eye towards trying
 
01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:56.219 align:start position:0%
to find the best deal for the rate
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
payers why not consider an existing
 
01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.070 align:start position:0%
payers why not consider an existing
facility

01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
and I will include my comments at that
 
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to answer questions
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
well thank you for
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
giving us your perspective on that
 
01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
question it's an important question I
 
01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:15.470 align:start position:0%
question it's an important question I
think

01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:17.149 align:start position:0%
think
um

01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the reason for the
 
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
existence of this bill is to stimulate
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
new investment and and New Generation
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
we're certainly going to need that
 
01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:32.629 align:start position:0%
we're certainly going to need that
um

01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
but if another purpose of the bill is
 
01:42:39.169 --> 01:42:39.179 align:start position:0%
reliability and low cost then
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it might be
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
worth asking the question or worth
 
01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:48.980 align:start position:0%
having the conversation can existing
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
sources provide some of that so thank
 
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
you thank you and and I agree and this
 
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
is all in the context of that rate payer
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
rate payer benefit and if an existing
 
01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
facility can't provide that rate payer
 
01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
benefit they don't participate in the
 
01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:05.510 align:start position:0%
benefit they don't participate in the
bill

01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else have a comment
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
so I'll go back again to the question
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
how can we help ensure that SB 54
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
results in a win for ratepayers and for
 
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
representative McGee did you want to
 
01:43:31.609 --> 01:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.850 --> 01:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I think some of the questions that
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
I sent you were formulated before the
 
01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:43.460 align:start position:0%
investigation that happened in between
 
01:43:46.609 --> 01:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
on the question that you just posed I'm
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
afraid I you know I
 
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
very much enjoy Mr Stock's presentation
 
01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:52.790 align:start position:0%
very much enjoy Mr Stock's presentation
and

01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:55.010 --> 01:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and I and I understand his point of
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
view I think the bill is actually
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
focused on something different with only
 
01:44:01.729 --> 01:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
a percentage of uh what is the New
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire energy market so
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
I I would like to see it you know more
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored in focused so that it
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
actually drives towards
 
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
you know the goals that have been
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
identified so we can skip this question
 
01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:17.750 align:start position:0%
identified so we can skip this question
then

01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to be fair which
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
question are you pointing to now it's uh
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
the on page two of your
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
of the table you sent out it's the
 
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
second question down no I'm fine
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
I want to try to tackle the question of
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
how can we encourage new resources that
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.609 --> 01:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
anybody have a
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
yes Mr below I I would just confirm that
 
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
um the bill would run into serious uh
 
01:44:59.330 --> 01:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
commerce clause for jurisdictional
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
issues if it if it explicitly tried to
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
say that the purpose is to favor New
 
01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generation in some way that's
 
01:45:09.649 --> 01:45:09.659 align:start position:0%
that's all I'd say
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
good point
 
01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:12.179 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
here's a question
 
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
does utility procurement via ppas
 
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
add risk to wholesale Market
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
procurements that might increase risk
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
premiums and thereby increase default
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
service energies RFP bids
 
01:45:29.689 --> 01:45:29.699 align:start position:0%
is that a risk
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
to passing this bill
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
very fair and astute question and I
 
01:45:54.239 --> 01:45:55.189 align:start position:0%
very fair and astute question and I
think

01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:45:55.199 --> 01:45:56.090 align:start position:0%
think
um

01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
you know not to hang so much on that may
 
01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
tashao but
 
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
taking out
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
eversource is obviously not a
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier and I can't speak
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
for them but from what I understand one
 
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
of their concerns when responding to our
 
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
solicitations is uncertainty how much of
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
the load might move away how much do
 
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
they have to serve and they build that
 
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
risk in and obviously Market volatility
 
01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
is another big factor in risk and so if
 
01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
the cost recovery and the the energy is
 
01:46:34.129 --> 01:46:34.139 align:start position:0%
Flowing outside of default service which
 
01:46:36.169 --> 01:46:36.179 align:start position:0%
that changed from May to shall would
 
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
ensure that it really doesn't impact the
 
01:46:41.530 --> 01:46:41.540 align:start position:0%
default service solicitation
 
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
and you know obviously the one of the
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
aims of the bill is to reduce Market
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
volatility by having more reliable
 
01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
resources in the market so it could help
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
on that end so I think the bill would
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
with that made a shall change on how the
 
01:47:04.250 --> 01:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
energy is flowed uh sort of makes it
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
neutral I think two competitive
 
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
suppliers not that I can speak for them
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
and the overall purpose being more
 
01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
reliable uh sources in the market would
 
01:47:19.729 --> 01:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.729 --> 01:47:21.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
we're actually uh making some serious
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
progress a serious dent in this list of
 
01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:30.109 align:start position:0%
progress a serious dent in this list of
questions

01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
another question from you guys what role
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
should the public play in the
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
procurement process
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
you want to elaborate on what you were
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just uh I put that in because
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
we had some comments during the public
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
hearings about the public having more
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
input so uh I guess the question is
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
beyond the role of the consumer Advocate
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay question about public input Mr
 
01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:13.669 align:start position:0%
okay question about public input Mr
locata

01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:17.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
amendments added in Senate committee was
 
01:48:24.770 --> 01:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
that the utilities May solicit public
 
01:48:27.609 --> 01:48:27.619 align:start position:0%
input on the development of the rfps
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
there has been I think a deal of
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
discussion about changing that may to a
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
shall that is also something that we
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
support and just to give a a very brief
 
01:48:41.209 --> 01:48:41.219 align:start position:0%
kind of frame of reference as we're
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
developing these rfps you know obviously
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
it is very much based on the statute and
 
01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
we would essentially put out like a
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
questionnaire to interested stakeholders
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the public of you know questions and
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
comments to provide feedback as we're in
 
01:48:59.090 --> 01:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
the development process obviously with
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh per the bill the OCA and consumer
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
Advocate and so the public there what
 
01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen in other jurisdictions tends
 
01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:08.699 align:start position:0%
to be you know folks who actually might
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
respond to the RFP who might have
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts about the r the the design and
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
and the like so I I do think that
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
um there is opportunity for public input
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
and of course once we go to the Public
 
01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission for approval of any
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
contracts there is an opportunity for
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
any member of the public or stakeholder
 
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
to participate in that so I think that
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
other May tuition would help strengthen
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.729 --> 01:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
great I think we're pretty well agreed
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
that we're going to make that change
 
01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.109 align:start position:0%
that we're going to make that change
okay

01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
we have another question here about
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
PP puc approval of these ppas and I know
 
01:49:59.050 --> 01:49:59.060 align:start position:0%
we have somebody from the puc here today
 
01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:01.340 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to put you on the spot
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to ask the question and if
 
01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
you want to consider answer answering it
 
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
you can should puc approval require
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
consideration of whether a PPA
 
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
disadvantages existing generation
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
resources that's the question
 
01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:19.790 align:start position:0%
resources that's the question
does

01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
anyone have a response to that question
 
01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
Ms Connors I think you might have
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of the bill is partly
 
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
reliability and is partly stability
 
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
then I think the impact that any
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
contract like this on the wholesale
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
markets and existing power plants Is
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
Fundamental whether or not it's a good a
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
good deal
 
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
even Massachusetts which has done huge
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
contracts directs the state
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
um Department of energy resources to do
 
01:51:00.169 --> 01:51:00.179 align:start position:0%
a periodic report on what the impact of
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
the wholesale markets are
 
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
and here's the thing if you are worried
 
01:51:08.090 --> 01:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
about at-risk generators retiring before
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
you have sufficient capacity online this
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
is the dream of the transition that
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
people talk about we will replace the
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
fossil units with intermittent resources
 
01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
and we can do this because we will have
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
so many intermittent resources that we
 
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
can make sure that we balance apply and
 
01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:24.229 align:start position:0%
can make sure that we balance apply and
demand

01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
demand
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
but by subsidizing those preferred
 
01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
resources you are putting additional
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
Financial strain on the existing
 
01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:33.590 align:start position:0%
Financial strain on the existing
resources

01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
if those are retiring prematurely you
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
will have both a price problem and a
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
reliability problem
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
we know that the risks that we're
 
01:51:46.609 --> 01:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
talking about aren't theoretical we're
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
seeing existing fossil units retiring
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
and in some cases being put on
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
reliability must run contracts to keep
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
them going
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
and those are partly why
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
the prices were so high this winter
 
01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
because the cost of the reliability must
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
run contract was so high and the price
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
of fuel was so uncertain that the the
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
rfps had to the people who responded to
 
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
the default service RFP had to account
 
01:52:18.290 --> 01:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
for that uncertainty in their bids
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
so I think that the risks that are
 
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
unintended are real both for price and
 
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
for reliability and the least we can do
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
is make sure that we're
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
asking the question through the
 
01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:37.010 align:start position:0%
 
would

01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:52:40.129 --> 01:52:40.139 align:start position:0%
requiring the puc to consider the
 
01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
disadvantages of
 
01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:46.139 align:start position:0%
ppas on existing resources be covered
 
01:52:49.609 --> 01:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
by the language on page three line nine
 
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
that says
 
01:52:53.689 --> 01:52:53.699 align:start position:0%
any other factors necessary to determine
 
01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
whether the agreement is just
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
and reasonable and in the public
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
interest with that language cover
 
01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
the puc considering the effect on
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
existing resources
 
01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
the challenge the puc faces I think is
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
someone who watches these proceedings
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
and has sympathy for people trying to do
 
01:53:15.169 --> 01:53:15.179 align:start position:0%
this work which is complex and difficult
 
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
is it they're not going to know before
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
the contract is signed which resources
 
01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
are going to retire the next year
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
the impact of the contract will not be
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
known until the contract is in effect
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
and so it certainly
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
um a risk and it's something that
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
highlights I think something
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas was asking at the
 
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
start of this how long is too long
 
01:53:41.229 --> 01:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
how big is too big
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
if you're you know if someone if if ever
 
01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
Source really does do an RFP for 2
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
million megawatt hours or the utilities
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
together do that
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
the puc will be able to look at what
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
retirements have taken place between the
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
time this bill passes and the time the
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
RFP might take effect but the fact is
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
the damage will be will be done after
 
01:54:05.689 --> 01:54:05.699 align:start position:0%
the contract is signed along with the
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
damage that the other State's rfps are
 
01:54:09.169 --> 01:54:09.179 align:start position:0%
already doing
 
01:54:11.209 --> 01:54:11.219 align:start position:0%
so you can put it in and the other thing
 
01:54:13.129 --> 01:54:13.139 align:start position:0%
is the puc has to factor in all of these
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
other considerations and they have to
 
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
wait they have to weigh a number of
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
uncertainties that are very hard to know
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
and that's a very challenging position
 
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
that this contract puts them in
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
because they also have to ask themselves
 
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
all these other questions is the price
 
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
so cheap that it's worth it you know
 
01:54:31.729 --> 01:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
they have to balance so many things this
 
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
is why we went to a this is why we
 
01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:35.219 align:start position:0%
stopped letting this is why we stopped
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
doing this because the risks are so high
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay good answer Mr Phelan also would
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
so I think that putting this into the
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
considerations represents
 
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
shifting a policy decision away from the
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislature to what is supposed to be an
 
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
adjudicative body so
 
01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
I mentioned before that this is a policy
 
01:55:11.410 --> 01:55:11.420 align:start position:0%
change for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:55:15.410 --> 01:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
the the department of energy is not
 
01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:17.420 align:start position:0%
traditionally one that has argued for
 
01:55:19.689 --> 01:55:19.699 align:start position:0%
out-of-market contracts for resources
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we have seen this as a reflection of
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
Market instability and conditions where
 
01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
we we simply don't have the resource mix
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we need moving forward
 
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
but we are also aware of the negative
 
01:55:39.590 --> 01:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
impacts of contracts to markets we have
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
made the determination that on on
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
balance this is the right choice for New
 
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rate payers uh the the puc is
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
not the appropriate body to decide
 
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
whether or not the the state should move
 
01:55:55.850 --> 01:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
forward with a policy change such as
 
01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
the POC will have to pass judgment on
 
01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:06.109 align:start position:0%
the POC will have to pass judgment on
the

01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
contracts though the ppas so we have to
 
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
be sure I think that we give them clear
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines on how to evaluate those ppas
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
so that they can
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
be effective and not
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
find themselves in the in the midst of a
 
01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:23.530 align:start position:0%
find themselves in the in the midst of a
morass

01:56:23.530 --> 01:56:23.540 align:start position:0%
morass
 
01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
of conflict about
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
what's appropriate to approve and what's
 
01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:31.550 align:start position:0%
what's appropriate to approve and what's
not

01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.090 --> 01:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
I have one final question here
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
should electricity from a PPA be used
 
01:56:40.729 --> 01:56:40.739 align:start position:0%
only for the utilities default Energy
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
Service obligation
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
anybody have a
 
01:56:56.890 --> 01:56:56.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.970 --> 01:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
don't know why I kept bringing up my
 
01:57:00.169 --> 01:57:00.179 align:start position:0%
notebook it's not like I have any
 
01:57:01.729 --> 01:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
answers in there
 
01:57:01.739 --> 01:57:02.570 align:start position:0%
answers in there
um

01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
so uh this is actually something that
 
01:57:08.209 --> 01:57:08.219 align:start position:0%
the utility uh that eversource uh pushed
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
back on and and I'll just explain why
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
that may and chow and the cost recovery
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
exist as it does so
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
um default service is is fluid
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
um customers are not obligated to take
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
default service they can leave default
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
service for a competitive supplier they
 
01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
could leave as part of the municipal
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
aggregation and so if the utility were
 
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
to enter into a long-term contract for a
 
01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
set amount of electricity and was
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
required to use that for default service
 
01:57:43.729 --> 01:57:43.739 align:start position:0%
if a large number of customers left
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
default service say for municipal
 
01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
aggregation Community power then
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
essentially the utility is left with a
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know liability which it cannot
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
recover we don't have a use for that
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
energy at that point and we need to sell
 
01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:01.490 align:start position:0%
energy at that point and we need to sell
it

01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
um in order to to be made whole and so
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
that is why the the mechanism of
 
01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
reselling into the market and then uh
 
01:58:13.250 --> 01:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
having the the credit or charge back to
 
01:58:16.010 --> 01:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
to all is so important and you know why
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
the utilities through through this is
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
actually you know kind of uniquely
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
positioned because other parties have
 
01:58:25.970 --> 01:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
that same fluidity issue as Mr Bulow
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
talked about you know if if Community
 
01:58:30.290 --> 01:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
power gets too expensive customers could
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
leave there where through the
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
distribution rate uh
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
not the distribution rate but as a
 
01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
charge to all customers say the stranded
 
01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
cost recovery charge you know you have
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
that stability
 
01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:46.149 align:start position:0%
that stability
okay

01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:48.890 --> 01:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:50.219 align:start position:0%
um the question that I wanted thanks for
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question the question that I
 
01:58:54.290 --> 01:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask was in regard to what
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
happens with the Rex
 
01:58:58.250 --> 01:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
because I think that was a legitimate
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
point for us to consider that we hadn't
 
01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
heard before and if we are looking to
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
make the bill as good as possible then
 
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
maybe we should have some discussion
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
around that because it's a large chunk
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
of the load and uh and those credits
 
01:59:14.530 --> 01:59:14.540 align:start position:0%
will be substantive so I'm just curious
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
however source and I feel like you're
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
speaking for all utilities since I don't
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
think we have other utilities here I am
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
not yeah yeah well I guess what I'm
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
um is that concept of sort of
 
01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:28.310 align:start position:0%
um is that concept of sort of
um

01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say socializing but you
 
01:59:33.169 --> 01:59:33.179 align:start position:0%
know democratizing the the credits back
 
01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:36.179 align:start position:0%
into the system to again further lower
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
costs for consumers is that something
 
01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
that you think is a reasonable thing for
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
us to build in
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
so I I think Mr Bulow uh raises
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh an interesting point so you know when
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
reading the bill
 
01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
as I think we would interpret it as you
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
know the resale of of those wrecks and
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
as he pointed out with such a large
 
02:00:02.209 --> 02:00:02.219 align:start position:0%
volume you're probably selling to a
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
broker who's then going to resell them
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
um and I think his concern is well if
 
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
you're selling it to a broker who then
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
is going to resell them there'll be a
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
charge associated with that
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
um I think I would just
 
02:00:21.169 --> 02:00:21.179 align:start position:0%
want to have some thought about
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
the the solution to that or the flow of
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
that and how that would look in language
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
it is I think uh
 
02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say complicated issue
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
but but you know you want to get that
 
02:00:37.010 --> 02:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
language right so I I
 
02:00:39.530 --> 02:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not adverse to the concern he's
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
raising or dismissive of it but you know
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
just sort of wanted to think that
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
through obviously with folks uh at
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
eversource who are smarter about this
 
02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:50.219 align:start position:0%
than I am
 
02:00:53.209 --> 02:00:53.219 align:start position:0%
okay we have a turnaround for that
 
02:00:55.729 --> 02:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
do my best okay thanks all right thanks
 
02:00:58.490 --> 02:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
well believe it or not we've actually
 
02:01:01.070 --> 02:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
gone through our entire list of
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
questions but we're not done
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do next is call for a
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
five minute breather
 
02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
so that we can all uh
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
reflect on what we've uh what we've
 
02:01:14.330 --> 02:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
heard then we're going to come back and
 
02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about all this so
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
please uh return to your seats let's say
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
by 10 past 11 and we'll resume this work
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
session but for now we're going to take
 
02:01:35.089 --> 02:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.099 --> 02:13:23.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.089 --> 02:13:26.099 align:start position:0%
can uh
 
02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
finish this up
 
02:13:31.609 --> 02:13:31.619 align:start position:0%
in the next uh maybe 45 minutes or so so
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
we can make some progress here this
 
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.609 --> 02:13:40.619 align:start position:0%
we have gone through the list of
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
questions that members of this
 
02:13:46.430 --> 02:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee had generated and we've we
 
02:13:49.370 --> 02:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
feel we've gotten adequate answers to
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
those questions
 
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
so what I would like to do next
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
is to find out if there are any other
 
02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
pieces of information that anybody
 
02:14:04.490 --> 02:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
sitting out there would like to offer to
 
02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:06.229 align:start position:0%
sitting out there would like to offer to
us

02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:14:10.609 --> 02:14:10.619 align:start position:0%
is uh yes Miss Alex Miss Alexander I
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
forgotten your last name
 
02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:19.129 align:start position:0%
forgotten your last name
spidel

02:14:19.129 --> 02:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:19.139 --> 02:14:26.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:28.370 --> 02:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a reasonable
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
request and we want to thank you for
 
02:14:33.410 --> 02:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
being here this morning I hope the
 
02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
conversation was Illuminating for you
 
02:14:37.850 --> 02:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
and that you'll be able to take back
 
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
some relevant information to discuss
 
02:14:42.770 --> 02:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
with the other members of the commission
 
02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:44.030 align:start position:0%
with the other members of the commission
staff

02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:14:47.450 --> 02:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
so thank you you you you are free to go
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.810 --> 02:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:01.189 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
Mr below did you have something you
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to add to this conversation
 
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's more of a question because
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't know about it and I wonder
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
um which is basically there's a you know
 
02:15:17.689 --> 02:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
the bill has a limited time frame
 
02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
understandable but my question is
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
are there
 
02:15:26.089 --> 02:15:26.099 align:start position:0%
it might there be value in giving
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
somebody doe or puc some flexibility to
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
extend the uh authorization to an agree
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
entering agreement no later than June 30
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
20 26.
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh because the question I have is what
 
02:15:42.530 --> 02:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
kind of projects are in development and
 
02:15:44.930 --> 02:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
sufficiently mature that they actually
 
02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
know their transmission interconnection
 
02:15:49.609 --> 02:15:49.619 align:start position:0%
cost or
 
02:15:53.149 --> 02:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
um that they can do a firm proposal and
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
there may be because because obviously
 
02:15:56.930 --> 02:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
what you'd want is a number of different
 
02:15:58.850 --> 02:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
projects different Technologies
 
02:16:02.089 --> 02:16:02.099 align:start position:0%
competing and it could be that there's
 
02:16:05.450 --> 02:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
just I don't know if this window aligns
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
when certain projects that might be in
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
the interconnection queue or get into
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
the interconnection queue with ISO New
 
02:16:14.689 --> 02:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
England are mature enough to be able to
 
02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
compete and so the question is what if
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
it turns out that there's a bunch of
 
02:16:20.810 --> 02:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
projects in development and if there was
 
02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
another six months for response that we
 
02:16:27.649 --> 02:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
would have a more robust uh
 
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
set of responses to an RFP I I guess
 
02:16:32.330 --> 02:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
that's my open question because I just
 
02:16:34.849 --> 02:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
don't know enough about where potential
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
new projects are in in development
 
02:16:40.129 --> 02:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
a reasonable question thank you for
 
02:16:42.169 --> 02:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
bringing that to our attention
 
02:16:42.179 --> 02:16:43.370 align:start position:0%
bringing that to our attention
okay

02:16:43.370 --> 02:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:46.310 --> 02:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
other information that people might like
 
02:16:57.530 --> 02:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:59.690 --> 02:16:59.700 align:start position:0%
the the committee has appropriously
 
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately been very focused on the
 
02:17:04.009 --> 02:17:04.019 align:start position:0%
cost of generation
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
I would think it I think it's important
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
to note that the bill also sort of gives
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
a blank check for the cost related to
 
02:17:10.679 --> 02:17:12.110 align:start position:0%
a blank check for the cost related to
transmission

02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:17:14.929 --> 02:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
with much less attention on that and I
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
have a Graphic that we use
 
02:17:19.310 --> 02:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
um that I will be happy to share with
 
02:17:21.290 --> 02:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
the committee yes we'll do that right
 
02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:35.389 align:start position:0%
the committee yes we'll do that right
now

02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
go ahead the reality for transmission in
 
02:17:40.810 --> 02:17:40.820 align:start position:0%
the region is that we've been investing
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
through the transmission portion of our
 
02:17:43.439 --> 02:17:44.270 align:start position:0%
through the transmission portion of our
bill

02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:17:48.410 --> 02:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
in billions billions across the region
 
02:17:49.849 --> 02:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
of which New Hampshire pays a set
 
02:17:52.129 --> 02:17:52.139 align:start position:0%
portion of for very important
 
02:17:54.169 --> 02:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
reliability upgrades and there are
 
02:17:55.810 --> 02:17:55.820 align:start position:0%
benefits to transmission
 
02:17:57.889 --> 02:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
I worked at the iso the transmission
 
02:18:01.009 --> 02:18:01.019 align:start position:0%
operator so I I know very well that
 
02:18:02.929 --> 02:18:02.939 align:start position:0%
there are benefits to investing in
 
02:18:02.939 --> 02:18:04.129 align:start position:0%
there are benefits to investing in
transmission

02:18:04.129 --> 02:18:04.139 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:18:04.139 --> 02:18:05.690 align:start position:0%
transmission
however

02:18:05.690 --> 02:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:18:10.310 --> 02:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
we know that we will continue to invest
 
02:18:17.450 --> 02:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
we are circulating the graphic to
 
02:18:22.730 --> 02:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
everyone who wants one they're right up
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
here on the edge of the table
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you continue Miss Connors
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
so something for the committee to sort
 
02:18:32.209 --> 02:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
of contemplate is right now you're
 
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
already paying this much more or New
 
02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's consumers are already paying
 
02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
incrementally more and we anticipate
 
02:18:42.530 --> 02:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
according to ISO New England that these
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
costs will continue to increase
 
02:18:46.490 --> 02:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
and that those are related to
 
02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
reliability these are costs that are
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
hard to control but are necessary for
 
02:18:52.429 --> 02:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
the reliable operation of the grid
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
but this bill asked New Hampshire rate
 
02:18:58.190 --> 02:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
payers to pay additional money on top of
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
what's already a regional cost for
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
for reliability and the iso has also
 
02:19:06.110 --> 02:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
signaled that in addition to the
 
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
reliability costs that they will be
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
funneling some State policies are
 
02:19:13.310 --> 02:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
driving even more money towards
 
02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
Transmission in order to interconnect
 
02:19:17.330 --> 02:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
Renewables and so something the
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
committee might want to consider is
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
whether that cost might be something
 
02:19:22.570 --> 02:19:22.580 align:start position:0%
worth knocking out of the bill
 
02:19:25.009 --> 02:19:25.019 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the transmission is kind of
 
02:19:27.469 --> 02:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
a blank check it's a lot of money and it
 
02:19:29.929 --> 02:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
it will be an incremental cost to the
 
02:19:31.969 --> 02:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
generation that will also be sitting in
 
02:19:36.490 --> 02:19:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:39.169 --> 02:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
interesting point
 
02:19:39.179 --> 02:19:41.330 align:start position:0%
interesting point
um

02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
any questions about that from well my
 
02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:46.139 align:start position:0%
representative was jettison from the
 
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
bill then who would pay it the developer
 
02:19:51.410 --> 02:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
who's already making however much
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
which is the status quo
 
02:19:59.210 --> 02:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
right now if you need if you need a line
 
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
for reliability we pay for it New
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pays its fair share for the
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
transmission it needs for the reliable
 
02:20:05.929 --> 02:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
operation of the grid to keep the lights
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
on and if someone wants to interconnect
 
02:20:10.429 --> 02:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
a generation project for profit then
 
02:20:15.469 --> 02:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:18.889 --> 02:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
okay good point I'd like to add one more
 
02:20:20.690 --> 02:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
thing that's not exactly specific to
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
this chart but it's in The Ether before
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
you do that representative Doug Thomas
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:20:30.250 --> 02:20:30.260 align:start position:0%
um yes I'm um
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
always suspect when I see percentages
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
like this could you put them into
 
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
perspective in terms of
 
02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts uh from say from a
 
02:20:42.889 --> 02:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
typical electric bill
 
02:20:44.809 --> 02:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
oh um
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's dollars I mean transmission is
 
02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
usually between a third and half of your
 
02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:51.230 align:start position:0%
usually between a third and half of your
bill

02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
a quarter I mean where's the cons could
 
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
could we have a done I mean
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
but uh but we can get you that in terms
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
of uh your actual bill like a the
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
proverbial 650 kilowatt monthly bill uh
 
02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
are we talking two dollars five dollars
 
02:21:15.469 --> 02:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
ten dollars for transmission costs can
 
02:21:21.530 --> 02:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
um someone with a lot of credibility
 
02:21:25.849 --> 02:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
behind me says it's it's at least two
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
two cents per kilowatt hour
 
02:21:30.610 --> 02:21:30.620 align:start position:0%
so two and a half okay
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
well I think in my territory was uh the
 
02:21:36.290 --> 02:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
overall bill was 22 cents a kilowatt
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
hour so two and a half cents out of 22
 
02:21:43.610 --> 02:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
says so and we can follow up with the
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
real numbers
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you now you can make your
 
02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
other point you know this is really
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
outside the impact of the markets but
 
02:21:54.290 --> 02:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
it's something that has been on the top
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
of a lot of conversation I've been
 
02:21:58.730 --> 02:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
overhearing which is there's no loss
 
02:22:01.730 --> 02:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
like a stop gap on the stranded cost for
 
02:22:04.969 --> 02:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
this and so the way this bill is written
 
02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no limit to how much
 
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
over market value the rate payers may be
 
02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
on the hook for and I think with this
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
this body has
 
02:22:16.490 --> 02:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
I think picked up wisdom from recent
 
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
legislative conversations regarding
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
over-market ppas something that we
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
should I would encourage people to
 
02:22:25.610 --> 02:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
consider is should you put a loss on how
 
02:22:29.690 --> 02:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
much of a how much loss or how high the
 
02:22:31.610 --> 02:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
over market cost could be the Berlin
 
02:22:33.710 --> 02:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
biomass plan I'm sorry to pick on one
 
02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
because lots of ppas have these problems
 
02:22:37.370 --> 02:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is the stranded
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
cost became so high that the legislation
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
there was legislation to address it I
 
02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
suggest that there should be a similar
 
02:22:45.410 --> 02:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
limit to how much the loss can be on the
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
rate payers for this but again this is
 
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of the wholesale
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
markets but it seemed to be top of mind
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
for the body how do we protect repairs
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of guard rails can we put on
 
02:22:56.570 --> 02:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
this bill I think identifying how much
 
02:22:58.730 --> 02:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
pain you're willing for the ratepayers
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
to take is also worth considering
 
02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
but you're the ones who are crafting
 
02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:10.910 align:start position:0%
but you're the ones who are crafting
that

02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
so would you suggest then that page
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
three of the bill starting at line one
 
02:23:20.450 --> 02:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
going down to line 10.
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
that talks about the commission's review
 
02:23:25.610 --> 02:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
of these ppas
 
02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:27.110 align:start position:0%
of these ppas
consider

02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:23:29.770 --> 02:23:29.780 align:start position:0%
adding a bullet
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
to encourage the commission to consider
 
02:23:36.530 --> 02:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
maybe capping
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
over Market costs in these ppas is that
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting I see that as a
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
way to put risk on the generator to
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
reduce costs and find efficiencies even
 
02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
after the contract's been signed and it
 
02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
protects the ratepayer because if you're
 
02:23:53.389 --> 02:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
a generator and you don't have a PPA you
 
02:23:54.889 --> 02:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
are constantly having to look at your
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
turbines looking at your at the training
 
02:24:01.010 --> 02:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
of your of your staff look at your your
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing operating expenses and you try
 
02:24:05.809 --> 02:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
to find efficiencies because someone is
 
02:24:07.969 --> 02:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
coming along behind you who's got better
 
02:24:10.969 --> 02:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
technology and better efficiencies and
 
02:24:10.979 --> 02:24:12.050 align:start position:0%
technology and better efficiencies and
so

02:24:12.050 --> 02:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
if if the generator doesn't have an
 
02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
incentive to do that why would they it
 
02:24:19.370 --> 02:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
costs money to reduce costs so I I see
 
02:24:21.410 --> 02:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
that as just a way to keep them in the
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay even though I think they should be
 
02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
in the market anyway
 
02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
well we thank you you've given us lots
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who would like to
 
02:24:38.210 --> 02:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield would like to address
 
02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Vos
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
um just regarding the question about
 
02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
could you include language to encourage
 
02:24:57.469 --> 02:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire resources that results in
 
02:24:59.929 --> 02:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire jobs I agree with the
 
02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
prior comments about
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
um not wanting to run a file of the
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause but I did just want to
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
point out to you that in existing law so
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
in RSA 362 F9 which is the existing
 
02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
purchase power agreement Authority in
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
the RPS law there is language that
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
directs the puc
 
02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:21.910 align:start position:0%
directs the puc
um

02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:25.730 --> 02:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
to consider actually it says doe today I
 
02:25:27.290 --> 02:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
would make a plug for changing that in
 
02:25:29.809 --> 02:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
this bill but I can I can do that later
 
02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
but there is language requiring
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
consideration of Economic Development
 
02:25:35.929 --> 02:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
and environmental benefits for New
 
02:25:38.210 --> 02:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
that is already in our law in another
 
02:25:43.070 --> 02:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
section and it seems as though it has
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
not run afoul of the Commerce Clause so
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
it's an additional consideration and
 
02:25:49.610 --> 02:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
actually in the in the Berlin biomass
 
02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:50.530 align:start position:0%
actually in the in the Berlin biomass
plant

02:25:50.530 --> 02:25:50.540 align:start position:0%
plant
 
02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
case that you know there was testimony
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
provided about the economic benefits and
 
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
the jobs as well as the environmental
 
02:25:59.690 --> 02:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
benefits so I just wanted to call that
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
language to your attention because it
 
02:26:03.889 --> 02:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
does seem as though it's past the
 
02:26:07.969 --> 02:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:09.950 --> 02:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate you
 
02:26:11.450 --> 02:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
looking that up
 
02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:12.889 align:start position:0%
looking that up
okay

02:26:12.889 --> 02:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
so I will pass out a piece of material
 
02:26:45.050 --> 02:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:47.330 --> 02:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
so I've passed out a couple of charts
 
02:26:50.690 --> 02:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
here that uh may not be surprising to
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
some of the room but really underscore
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
the challenge that we see and what we're
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking for in a targeted solution
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
so first I'll point to the wholesale
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
prices that are linked to Natural Gas
 
02:27:07.610 --> 02:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
slide because that does a good job of
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
illustrating a lot of points about the
 
02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
New England system that we have to keep
 
02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
in mind you can see extremely large
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
winter price spikes that are tied to the
 
02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
price of natural gas
 
02:27:23.929 --> 02:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
um this is the volatility that we are
 
02:27:28.190 --> 02:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
aimed at combating here so while prices
 
02:27:30.349 --> 02:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
may be low for most of the year and
 
02:27:32.450 --> 02:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
while sometimes this these sort of
 
02:27:34.370 --> 02:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
contracts these Hedges will look like a
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
bad deal we are looking at those big
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
Sprite big spikes and really considering
 
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
how those affect New Hampshire rate
 
02:27:44.270 --> 02:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
payers you can also turn to the other
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
side where you can see the annual value
 
02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the wholesale energy markets and
 
02:27:52.849 --> 02:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
you'll notice if you flip back and forth
 
02:27:55.010 --> 02:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
between the two that the higher cost
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
years are linked to those higher priced
 
02:27:57.600 --> 02:27:59.030 align:start position:0%
years are linked to those higher priced
Winters

02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
Winters
 
02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
so winter is driving a lot of the costs
 
02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire rate payers see and
 
02:28:09.230 --> 02:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
winter is where some of these was where
 
02:28:11.150 --> 02:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
the reliability Solutions should be
 
02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:12.770 align:start position:0%
the reliability Solutions should be
focused

02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
focused
 
02:28:15.170 --> 02:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
I did want to say a brief word on the
 
02:28:18.250 --> 02:28:18.260 align:start position:0%
circulated amended version of the bill
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
in particular to its references to
 
02:28:24.170 --> 02:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
in-state electricity Supply the
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
department is very opposed to including
 
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
those within the bill itself I
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
02:28:36.050 --> 02:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
the drive behind it but uh
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
the development of so if looking at uh
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
legislative findings Roman 3 the
 
02:28:43.849 --> 02:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
development of reliable sources of
 
02:28:43.859 --> 02:28:45.170 align:start position:0%
development of reliable sources of
low-cost

02:28:45.170 --> 02:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
low-cost
 
02:28:47.570 --> 02:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
electricity Supply as I would prefer is
 
02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
critical to stabilizing and reducing the
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity in New Hampshire
 
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
there is not particularly a distinction
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
between energy Supply in New Hampshire
 
02:28:58.929 --> 02:28:58.939 align:start position:0%
and energy Supply within New England
 
02:29:03.309 --> 02:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
so the the wholesale prices are
 
02:29:06.429 --> 02:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
relatively the same across the region
 
02:29:09.170 --> 02:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
and there is not really a difference
 
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
between the reliability benefits of an
 
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
in-state and out-of-state resource I
 
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
believe there's also a reference to
 
02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:18.650 align:start position:0%
believe there's also a reference to
in-state

02:29:18.650 --> 02:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
in-state
 
02:29:18.660 --> 02:29:20.330 align:start position:0%
in-state
um

02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:26.410 --> 02:29:26.420 align:start position:0%
in another in under uh Romans 3 uh
 
02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:28.250 align:start position:0%
in another in under uh Romans 3 uh
d

02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
d
 
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
where it says supports the
 
02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
diversification of New Hampshire's
 
02:29:34.730 --> 02:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
in-state electric energy sources I I
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
don't believe that is uh the objective
 
02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
of this bill and and I don't believe
 
02:29:41.570 --> 02:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
that that should be included in a final
 
02:29:44.210 --> 02:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
version thank you
 
02:29:47.630 --> 02:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you is there anyone else who
 
02:29:49.730 --> 02:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
would like to make a contribution to our
 
02:29:55.849 --> 02:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none what we're going to do next
 
02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
is representative McGee has prepared an
 
02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:03.490 align:start position:0%
is representative McGee has prepared an
amendment

02:30:03.490 --> 02:30:03.500 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:30:06.590 --> 02:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
2023-1464 H we're going to go through
 
02:30:09.050 --> 02:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
this amendment and consider the changes
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
that it makes to the bill
 
02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to decide whether
 
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
there are any further changes that need
 
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
to be made
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
or whether this is an amendment that
 
02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:20.150 align:start position:0%
or whether this is an amendment that
should

02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
should
 
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
so Mr Phelan has pointed out that on
 
02:30:30.770 --> 02:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
page one line 9 the word in state should
 
02:30:32.570 --> 02:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
probably be stricken
 
02:30:36.849 --> 02:30:36.859 align:start position:0%
and then on page three line 13
 
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
the phrase in state should also be
 
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
stricken I think that's
 
02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea I know
 
02:30:50.570 --> 02:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGee youth who wanted to
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that this bill benefited New
 
02:30:57.170 --> 02:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ratepayers we all want that
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
but this does raise some
 
02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause issues so I think it's
 
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable to strike that language yeah
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
I think also where it's listed on page
 
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
three supports the diversification of
 
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's electric energy sources
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
is fine you know I I'm not trying to put
 
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
a straight jacket on anyone I was trying
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
to sort of further clarify what our
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
objectives were and I I thought that's
 
02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
what I had heard originally is that
 
02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
that's where it would be focused but I
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't have any objection to those
 
02:31:29.450 --> 02:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
changes okay now could you walk us
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
through the other changes that this
 
02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:32.750 align:start position:0%
through the other changes that this
amendment

02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:31:35.090 --> 02:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
provides yeah I didn't expect that they
 
02:31:38.210 --> 02:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be bolded
 
02:31:40.190 --> 02:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
so hmm
 
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to be interesting okay so if
 
02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
we start on page one in section two the
 
02:31:48.410 --> 02:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity in New England is
 
02:31:50.270 --> 02:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
driven by a number of factors including
 
02:31:52.130 --> 02:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
the retirement of Base load generation
 
02:31:55.309 --> 02:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
resources dependence on natural gas for
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
regional demand and increases in the
 
02:31:59.809 --> 02:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
cost of natural gas due to International
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
factors I thought what we had there
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
originally for the second clause
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
which was a lack of gas I thought that
 
02:32:13.610 --> 02:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
was a not the more generic language of
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
describing what the issue is so anyway
 
02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
that's the first change and then under
 
02:32:22.130 --> 02:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that's another place where the
 
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
in-state we just discussed taking that
 
02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:27.349 align:start position:0%
in-state we just discussed taking that
out

02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:32:27.359 --> 02:32:30.410 align:start position:0%
out
so

02:32:30.410 --> 02:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:38.750 --> 02:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question yes
 
02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:39.770 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question yes
uh

02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:42.290 --> 02:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
I have a question on what you uh just
 
02:32:44.770 --> 02:32:44.780 align:start position:0%
said there has it not been
 
02:32:49.010 --> 02:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
proven that part of the cost of our
 
02:32:52.490 --> 02:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
electricity is due to the lack of
 
02:32:55.250 --> 02:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
capacity of our natural gas during the
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
winter time
 
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:05.210 --> 02:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
I think our dependence on natural gas
 
02:33:07.790 --> 02:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
for regional demand is probably a more
 
02:33:10.730 --> 02:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
accurate description of why the cost
 
02:33:14.929 --> 02:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.170 --> 02:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh we've heard over the years that that
 
02:33:18.180 --> 02:33:18.830 align:start position:0%
uh we've heard over the years that that
um

02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:21.010 --> 02:33:21.020 align:start position:0%
particularly in the wintertime the
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
capacity Factor has has really resulted
 
02:33:27.050 --> 02:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
in higher costs but I just didn't know
 
02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to take that out or not
 
02:33:33.889 --> 02:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
well I I guess what I would say by way
 
02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
of clarification is that it was natural
 
02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
gas by prices that spiked and a lack of
 
02:33:44.690 --> 02:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
sufficient or adequate Supply to meet
 
02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:45.770 align:start position:0%
sufficient or adequate Supply to meet
demand

02:33:45.770 --> 02:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
demand
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
can be satisfied by a number of
 
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
different resources that's not the only
 
02:33:51.290 --> 02:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
resource that could satisfy it so that's
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
why I thought it should be clarified
 
02:33:56.450 --> 02:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
02:33:59.210 --> 02:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
well replacing the word words lack of
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
adequate natural gas capacity in the
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
winter with regional dependence on
 
02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
natural gas for seasonal Peak demand
 
02:34:09.290 --> 02:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
to me that doesn't seem like a like a
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
big change I mean it's not a hill to die
 
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
on no I think that's a that's an okay
 
02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:15.950 align:start position:0%
on no I think that's a that's an okay
change

02:34:15.950 --> 02:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
so then under Roman numeral four oh well
 
02:34:21.530 --> 02:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
before you go on but we do have to
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
consider that any change that we're
 
02:34:25.490 --> 02:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
going to make is a change that the
 
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
Senate would need to accept yep so we
 
02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:30.590 align:start position:0%
Senate would need to accept yep so we
don't

02:34:30.590 --> 02:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
by that I mean we don't want to make
 
02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
changes just for the sake of making
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
changes we want to make changes that we
 
02:34:39.290 --> 02:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
think are critical
 
02:34:40.730 --> 02:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
viability of the legislation and also
 
02:34:45.830 --> 02:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
make changes that we think the Senate
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
I I just throw that out as we go through
 
02:34:54.050 --> 02:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
the rest of these changes please
 
02:34:56.330 --> 02:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
continue I appreciate that Mr chairman
 
02:34:58.010 --> 02:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
um again this section is the legislative
 
02:35:02.270 --> 02:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
findings and statement of purpose so
 
02:35:04.849 --> 02:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
under section four again I change the
 
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
language to make it more just objective
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
and statement recent Market volatility
 
02:35:12.650 --> 02:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
has harmed New Hampshire's residents and
 
02:35:14.090 --> 02:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
businesses so I just made it a
 
02:35:16.690 --> 02:35:16.700 align:start position:0%
declarative statement it's a finding
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
and then under five
 
02:35:20.399 --> 02:35:22.309 align:start position:0%
and then under five
um

02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
to ensure that New Hampshire rate payers
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
can benefit from I added low cost
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
energy sources to address unprecedented
 
02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
price volatility so I just added the
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
word low and to address
 
02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:38.030 align:start position:0%
word low and to address
um

02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:40.670 --> 02:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
so again just making them
 
02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
any comment on those changes they seem
 
02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:49.010 --> 02:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
um okay continue and then when you skip
 
02:35:50.450 --> 02:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
down to
 
02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:51.170 align:start position:0%
down to
um

02:35:51.170 --> 02:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:53.889 --> 02:35:53.899 align:start position:0%
the purchase power agreements section
 
02:35:57.770 --> 02:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 1 low-cost reliable energy
 
02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals
 
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
the sentence after letter A
 
02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
I took the word issue which was after
 
02:36:12.650 --> 02:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
the date and brought it to before no
 
02:36:16.250 --> 02:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
later than June 30th 2025 because
 
02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
just grammar
 
02:36:21.490 --> 02:36:21.500 align:start position:0%
so it basically now would read
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
investor-owned electric distribution
 
02:36:25.849 --> 02:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
utilities may elect to develop and issue
 
02:36:29.090 --> 02:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
no later than June 30th 2025 a request
 
02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
for proposals because the request for
 
02:36:33.770 --> 02:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
proposals piece is really where the
 
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
separation should be the word issue
 
02:36:37.969 --> 02:36:37.979 align:start position:0%
didn't belong on the other end of the so
 
02:36:39.650 --> 02:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
that was just a grammatical thing and
 
02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:40.389 align:start position:0%
that was just a grammatical thing and
then

02:36:40.389 --> 02:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:36:44.990 --> 02:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
to continue on that sentence
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
um for multi-year agreements for energy
 
02:36:49.309 --> 02:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
or independent of any attendant
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes from electric
 
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
energy sources I originally wanted to
 
02:37:00.469 --> 02:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
remove that and after I had a
 
02:37:02.690 --> 02:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
conversation with other folks that
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
understood why that language was in
 
02:37:07.309 --> 02:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
there I put it back in so I don't think
 
02:37:12.349 --> 02:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
so then we can skip down to
 
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
number three under that section that
 
02:37:20.809 --> 02:37:20.819 align:start position:0%
starts with electric distribution
 
02:37:23.389 --> 02:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
utilities shell consult with the
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the language that
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
was added goes down to let me just see
 
02:37:29.570 --> 02:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
if I can
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
a new language would be on page two
 
02:37:33.889 --> 02:37:33.899 align:start position:0%
starting at line one right starting at
 
02:37:35.210 --> 02:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
line one right
 
02:37:37.870 --> 02:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
so it says
 
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh the department and the office of the
 
02:37:43.490 --> 02:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate added languages shall
 
02:37:45.290 --> 02:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
engage in independent third party with
 
02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
utility purchase power agreement
 
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
expertise to help
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
that was added there and then the last
 
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
line of that section within this period
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
the utilities shall solicit public
 
02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:58.190 align:start position:0%
the utilities shall solicit public
comment

02:37:58.190 --> 02:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:38:00.650 --> 02:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
and the next section four okay before
 
02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
you move on with that could I just ask
 
02:38:04.730 --> 02:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate if he has any
 
02:38:11.150 --> 02:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:12.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
so the language says
 
02:38:20.450 --> 02:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
the department and the office of the
 
02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
 
02:38:25.809 --> 02:38:25.819 align:start position:0%
shall engage an independent third party
 
02:38:28.610 --> 02:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
with utility purchase power agreement
 
02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:30.590 align:start position:0%
with utility purchase power agreement
expertise

02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
02:38:33.410 --> 02:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
to help provide any such consultation
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
within 60 days from the date of
 
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
from the date each draft request for
 
02:38:47.809 --> 02:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
so if your question is would we be
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
willing to work with the Department of
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
energy to do that just what is your
 
02:38:55.610 --> 02:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
reaction to that change to the
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
legislation I I I'm I think that if that
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
is what is going to help that bill
 
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
become law I'm I'm all for it we'd be
 
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
delighted to work with the Department of
 
02:39:08.330 --> 02:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
energy my only concern is anytime you
 
02:39:11.690 --> 02:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
ask a state agency to enter into a
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship with anybody
 
02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
there's every reason to think that we'll
 
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
have to go to the governor and Council
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
for its approval and that tends to slow
 
02:39:22.250 --> 02:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
things down so that's an issue but uh I
 
02:39:24.290 --> 02:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
I we we do need that kind of independent
 
02:39:27.530 --> 02:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
outside help to do a great job
 
02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:30.010 align:start position:0%
outside help to do a great job
um

02:39:30.010 --> 02:39:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
 
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'm unclear as to whether this language
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
says the department and the consumer
 
02:39:44.809 --> 02:39:44.819 align:start position:0%
Advocate each do this or collectively do
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
this with one independent
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh third party I I was assuming that you
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
meant that we and the department would
 
02:39:54.889 --> 02:39:54.899 align:start position:0%
work together and jointly hire a
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
consultant okay that that's not clear to
 
02:39:57.840 --> 02:39:59.590 align:start position:0%
consultant okay that that's not clear to
me

02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
I think it could be interpreted that you
 
02:40:05.809 --> 02:40:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:07.849 --> 02:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
indeed that would be expensive though
 
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:14.929 --> 02:40:14.939 align:start position:0%
I think if it said the department
 
02:40:17.210 --> 02:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
or the con Office of the consumer
 
02:40:20.990 --> 02:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
that would probably indicate that they
 
02:40:25.370 --> 02:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
were doing it independently but when it
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
says and
 
02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
then I would
 
02:40:31.130 --> 02:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
I would guess that that would direct
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Chris for your
 
02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:41.990 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Chris for your
reaction

02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
reaction
 
02:40:45.349 --> 02:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
and I think I already added that the
 
02:40:47.330 --> 02:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
next line within this period the utility
 
02:40:49.370 --> 02:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
shall solicit public comment that was
 
02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:50.270 align:start position:0%
shall solicit public comment that was
another

02:40:50.270 --> 02:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
comment we heard here today was that
 
02:40:54.530 --> 02:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
they would like there to be some ability
 
02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
for stakeholders around the process to
 
02:40:59.030 --> 02:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
be able to comment so that's uh that was
 
02:41:01.849 --> 02:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
changed from May to Shell yes that's a
 
02:41:03.290 --> 02:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
good change I think everybody's in
 
02:41:05.210 --> 02:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
agreement with that and then section
 
02:41:08.090 --> 02:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
um oh go ahead Mr Roberts from the
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:17.809 --> 02:41:17.819 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just going to note that when we
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
were talking about the
 
02:41:22.010 --> 02:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
independent third party so if you're
 
02:41:24.050 --> 02:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
looking at lines the paragraph beginning
 
02:41:27.650 --> 02:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
or looking at lines one and on
 
02:41:29.929 --> 02:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
um that requires us to engage in
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
independent third party and then section
 
02:41:34.849 --> 02:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
four immediately after that uh requires
 
02:41:37.150 --> 02:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
us again to
 
02:41:40.670 --> 02:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
hire an independent third party
 
02:41:43.490 --> 02:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just not sure
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
the bill needs to have both of those so
 
02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
your question is is that redundant yes
 
02:41:50.809 --> 02:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:41:55.309 --> 02:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.710 --> 02:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
going back to the beginning of the
 
02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:16.570 align:start position:0%
going back to the beginning of the
paragraph

02:42:16.570 --> 02:42:16.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:19.250 --> 02:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
well it does appear to be redundant yeah
 
02:42:20.690 --> 02:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that's inconsistent
 
02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
is I think we had suggested that the
 
02:42:25.490 --> 02:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
utilities would be doing the actual
 
02:42:28.370 --> 02:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
request for proposals
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
right that they would they they're
 
02:42:32.929 --> 02:42:32.939 align:start position:0%
they're also going to be required to
 
02:42:35.270 --> 02:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
have somebody independent work with them
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
so maybe this language in section four
 
02:42:37.319 --> 02:42:38.210 align:start position:0%
so maybe this language in section four
is

02:42:38.210 --> 02:42:38.220 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:42:40.429 --> 02:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
I think what section 4 is trying to
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
achieve is to say that if they exceed in
 
02:42:45.650 --> 02:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
any contracts that 10 000 that they have
 
02:42:47.690 --> 02:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
to go in front of the governor and
 
02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
Council right for approval so
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
that paragraph may be trying to
 
02:42:53.570 --> 02:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
accomplish something else and I just we
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
were repeating language that maybe
 
02:43:04.370 --> 02:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:12.050 --> 02:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
consumer Office of Consumer advocate
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
of the the electric distribution utility
 
02:43:22.250 --> 02:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
shall consult with the Department of
 
02:43:24.410 --> 02:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
energy in the office of the consumer
 
02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:25.429 align:start position:0%
energy in the office of the consumer
advocate

02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
02:43:31.370 --> 02:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then you added the language about
 
02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:38.170 align:start position:0%
engaging an independent third party
 
02:43:38.170 --> 02:43:43.010 align:start position:0%
engaging an independent third party
[Music]

02:43:43.010 --> 02:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
but it's already in paragraph four
 
02:43:49.309 --> 02:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
so maybe we don't need to add that
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
additional language I guess is what I'm
 
02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:52.730 align:start position:0%
additional language I guess is what I'm
saying

02:43:52.730 --> 02:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
we'll leave section three as it was
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
originally written yeah removed okay
 
02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
all right and that addresses the
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
question of redundancy bye removing that
 
02:44:20.570 --> 02:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
language okay next what um
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
what what other changes in your
 
02:44:25.250 --> 02:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative McGee
 
02:44:27.889 --> 02:44:27.899 align:start position:0%
move back here
 
02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh in section four the department of
 
02:44:37.790 --> 02:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
energy shall hire an independent third
 
02:44:40.490 --> 02:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
party so that shall and independent
 
02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
third party were added to section four
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:44:45.479 --> 02:44:48.290 align:start position:0%
which is
um

02:44:48.290 --> 02:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
online I'm sorry online five say that
 
02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
again where where are we we are on line
 
02:44:54.650 --> 02:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
five on page two the department of
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
energy shall hire an independent third
 
02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:57.110 align:start position:0%
energy shall hire an independent third
party

02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:44:57.120 --> 02:44:58.429 align:start position:0%
party
so

02:44:58.429 --> 02:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
shall and and independent third party
 
02:45:03.530 --> 02:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
were added
 
02:45:05.270 --> 02:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
I thought these were going to be bolded
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry for the confusion that it
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
came in as a replace so Department of
 
02:45:11.929 --> 02:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Gene May hire oh shall hire
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay yep
 
02:45:16.429 --> 02:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
and departed third party okay that's
 
02:45:18.050 --> 02:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
that seems reasonable
 
02:45:21.710 --> 02:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
and then section five was added
 
02:45:23.870 --> 02:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
um electric distribution utilities shall
 
02:45:25.790 --> 02:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
engage and independent third party to
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
perform a cost benefit analysis of any
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
agreements received in response to the
 
02:45:32.690 --> 02:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
request for proposals such analysis
 
02:45:34.849 --> 02:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
shall be provided to the commission as
 
02:45:36.410 --> 02:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
part of the utilities petition for
 
02:45:37.969 --> 02:45:37.979 align:start position:0%
approval of any purchase power
 
02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
agreements resulting from the RFP
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
process so that was just to make sure
 
02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:43.010 align:start position:0%
process so that was just to make sure
that

02:45:43.010 --> 02:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:44.809 --> 02:45:44.819 align:start position:0%
that a professional cost benefits
 
02:45:46.610 --> 02:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
analysis would be available to the puc
 
02:45:48.469 --> 02:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
since they're going to have to determine
 
02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:51.770 align:start position:0%
whether it's
appropriate

02:45:51.770 --> 02:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:45:54.770 --> 02:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
and that language is acceptable to
 
02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:58.200 --> 02:45:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:45:59.870 --> 02:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:46:02.270 --> 02:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
next all right well we're running down
 
02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:04.309 align:start position:0%
next all right well we're running down
here

02:46:04.309 --> 02:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:46:04.319 --> 02:46:06.290 align:start position:0%
here
um

02:46:06.290 --> 02:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:09.050 --> 02:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
I have to locate it in the
 
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
piece we just got let's see okay
 
02:46:19.550 --> 02:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you JD
 
02:46:25.849 --> 02:46:25.859 align:start position:0%
okay so that would be letter E Line 14
 
02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
02:46:30.469 --> 02:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
would be any other factors oh I'm sorry
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
let's go to C first which is on page on
 
02:46:36.590 --> 02:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
line 12.
 
02:46:38.570 --> 02:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
um Fosters price to billion helps reduce
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
customer exposure to Market volatility I
 
02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:42.770 align:start position:0%
customer exposure to Market volatility I
inserted

02:46:42.770 --> 02:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
inserted
 
02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:44.809 align:start position:0%
inserted
customer

02:46:44.809 --> 02:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
customer
 
02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
I thought
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
or maybe it was there originally so
 
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
maybe I
 
02:46:52.730 --> 02:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
I did a bunch of edits and then I backed
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
them out so if it's already there then I
 
02:46:57.650 --> 02:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't worry about it no it's not
 
02:47:00.889 --> 02:47:00.899 align:start position:0%
there it's not there okay
 
02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
oh that's right I'm looking at the
 
02:47:04.969 --> 02:47:04.979 align:start position:0%
amendment that's right okay so customer
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
exposure was what um
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
I added to modify that sentence and then
 
02:47:13.370 --> 02:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
in D I had added in state which we
 
02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
already agreed should be backed out
 
02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:16.250 align:start position:0%
already agreed should be backed out
again

02:47:16.250 --> 02:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct we didn't want it we're
 
02:47:19.610 --> 02:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
going to check that out yes so now we're
 
02:47:21.230 --> 02:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
at e
 
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
um on line 14 which is any other factors
 
02:47:25.250 --> 02:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
necessary to determine whether the
 
02:47:27.290 --> 02:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
agreement is just and reasonable and in
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
the public interest comma
 
02:47:33.230 --> 02:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
such as does the contract contain colon
 
02:47:35.510 --> 02:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
performance incentives for meeting cost
 
02:47:38.090 --> 02:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
projections and Generator penalties for
 
02:47:40.610 --> 02:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
non-performance during demand periods to
 
02:47:42.770 --> 02:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
protect rate payers from demand price
 
02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
spikes and promote delivery of reliable
 
02:47:45.359 --> 02:47:46.670 align:start position:0%
spikes and promote delivery of reliable
service

02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
and I believe we spoke earlier about
 
02:47:50.750 --> 02:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
removing the word Peak so the copy that
 
02:47:54.170 --> 02:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
I'm reading already has that removed
 
02:47:54.180 --> 02:47:54.950 align:start position:0%
I'm reading already has that removed
um

02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:57.770 --> 02:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
but the copy you have has has peak in
 
02:47:58.969 --> 02:47:58.979 align:start position:0%
there that was before the testimony
 
02:48:02.929 --> 02:48:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:04.849 --> 02:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
all right if we remove the word Peak
 
02:48:07.370 --> 02:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
then it would say non-performance during
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not language that I think
 
02:48:18.650 --> 02:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
the POC could interpret
 
02:48:18.660 --> 02:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
the POC could interpret
easily

02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
so if we were going to eliminate the
 
02:48:28.190 --> 02:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
word Peak we would probably also have to
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
eliminate the words during Peak demand
 
02:48:30.479 --> 02:48:32.090 align:start position:0%
eliminate the words during Peak demand
periods

02:48:32.090 --> 02:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
periods
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
so then it would read
 
02:48:36.050 --> 02:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
meeting cost projections and Generator
 
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
penalties for non-performance to protect
 
02:48:43.969 --> 02:48:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:46.370 --> 02:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
so we'll strike that hole
 
02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:51.410 align:start position:0%
so we'll strike that hole
phrase

02:48:51.410 --> 02:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay next and then the next section is
 
02:48:57.770 --> 02:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
section four which is on line 18 and it
 
02:48:59.389 --> 02:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
says upon receiving Public Utilities
 
02:49:01.969 --> 02:49:01.979 align:start position:0%
Commission approval of an agreement to
 
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
purchase electric energy in conjunction
 
02:49:07.490 --> 02:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
with or independent of any attendant
 
02:49:09.290 --> 02:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes and
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
investor-owned electric distribution
 
02:49:14.929 --> 02:49:14.939 align:start position:0%
utility shall that's the change sell
 
02:49:17.690 --> 02:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
such purchased energy and any
 
02:49:19.309 --> 02:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes when the
 
02:49:21.770 --> 02:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market in the man in the
 
02:49:24.050 --> 02:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
manner to minimize costs and maximize
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
benefits to rate payers and then rather
 
02:49:29.150 --> 02:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
than if I changed it to when the
 
02:49:31.610 --> 02:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utility sells into
 
02:49:34.010 --> 02:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market it shall and then
 
02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
there there aren't any other changes
 
02:49:38.469 --> 02:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:42.290 --> 02:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
okay those are good changes I think
 
02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:44.690 align:start position:0%
okay those are good changes I think
oh

02:49:44.690 --> 02:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:49:47.630 --> 02:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh is that
 
02:49:51.770 --> 02:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.210 --> 02:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:49:55.790 --> 02:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
comments on those changes representative
 
02:49:55.800 --> 02:49:56.990 align:start position:0%
comments on those changes representative
Corman

02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
Corman
 
02:50:00.889 --> 02:50:00.899 align:start position:0%
there was one other change on line 27
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
page three
 
02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh where it says any Electric
 
02:50:06.770 --> 02:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
Cooperative the word rural had been
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
removed it had said any Rural Electric
 
02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:11.150 align:start position:0%
removed it had said any Rural Electric
cooperatives

02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
cooperatives
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
and and I can explain that um yes please
 
02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
do Mr locata explained to me that in
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
statute currently that is this is the
 
02:50:22.130 --> 02:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
descriptor for the only Cooperative
 
02:50:24.530 --> 02:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's operating uh at with a
 
02:50:26.090 --> 02:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
certificate of deregulation on file
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
which is the New Hampshire Electric
 
02:50:30.530 --> 02:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
Co-op it's referred to as a Rural
 
02:50:32.510 --> 02:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
Electric Cooperative so that's the
 
02:50:34.910 --> 02:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
language that already exists and I
 
02:50:37.790 --> 02:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of that so
 
02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:38.450 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of that so
um

02:50:38.450 --> 02:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:40.190 --> 02:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
if we want to leave it in for
 
02:50:43.130 --> 02:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
consistency that's fine with me
 
02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
so why did you delete it then I
 
02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
originally had any New Hampshire
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
Electric Cooperative to broaden the term
 
02:50:51.889 --> 02:50:51.899 align:start position:0%
from rural because I didn't know what
 
02:50:53.750 --> 02:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
rural meant and then he told me what
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
role meant and I'm not sure why
 
02:50:58.730 --> 02:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
why it isn't back in here as well why
 
02:51:02.389 --> 02:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um that's how it happened that's how it
 
02:51:07.010 --> 02:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
came to be anybody have a concern about
 
02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not the word rural is crucial
 
02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:24.969 --> 02:51:24.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:27.650 --> 02:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll put the word rural back in
 
02:51:27.660 --> 02:51:28.490 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll put the word rural back in
then

02:51:28.490 --> 02:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:51:30.650 --> 02:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
and it also needs to go back into line
 
02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:36.830 align:start position:0%
and it also needs to go back into line
33.

02:51:36.830 --> 02:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:39.170 --> 02:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
two places then
 
02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:42.110 align:start position:0%
two places then
okay

02:51:42.110 --> 02:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:44.630 --> 02:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
and those are all the changes that your
 
02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:56.889 --> 02:51:56.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:00.290 --> 02:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
I think the only other outstanding issue
 
02:52:01.849 --> 02:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
that we had discussed potentially
 
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
including was
 
02:52:06.530 --> 02:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
um to see if there was a place where we
 
02:52:08.710 --> 02:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
could discuss
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
the attributes the environmental
 
02:52:13.190 --> 02:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
attributes or wrecks
 
02:52:14.330 --> 02:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we're going to be
 
02:52:16.910 --> 02:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
able to Wordsmith that and we're not
 
02:52:22.370 --> 02:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:22.380 --> 02:52:24.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:52:24.050 --> 02:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
but before we leave today I want to
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
decide if we're going to try to address
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
that issue but we're not going to
 
02:52:31.210 --> 02:52:31.220 align:start position:0%
address it today
 
02:52:33.650 --> 02:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
if we decide we're going to address it
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to have to have at
 
02:52:37.849 --> 02:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
least one more work session
 
02:52:40.730 --> 02:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have to ask for some
 
02:52:43.130 --> 02:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
help in coming up with language
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
but we'll put that up for a minute to
 
02:52:47.389 --> 02:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
there are no other suggested amendments
 
02:52:52.010 --> 02:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
here that we want to consider
 
02:52:55.309 --> 02:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:58.130 --> 02:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
the what I hope will be the committee
 
02:52:58.140 --> 02:53:00.230 align:start position:0%
the what I hope will be the committee
Amendment

02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:53:02.330 --> 02:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a question yes Mr
 
02:53:04.389 --> 02:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
someone was brought up in a testimony
 
02:53:08.290 --> 02:53:08.300 align:start position:0%
was at the very end of section three
 
02:53:11.630 --> 02:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
after line e there was a suggestion
 
02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
about putting in something about capping
 
02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:14.990 align:start position:0%
about putting in something about capping
costs

02:53:14.990 --> 02:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if we want to do that in
 
02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
this or if that would require a rewrite
 
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:28.969 --> 02:53:28.979 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
02:53:28.979 --> 02:53:33.230 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
um

02:53:33.230 --> 02:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:35.150 --> 02:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about
 
02:53:39.110 --> 02:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
a cap of over-market costs that's
 
02:53:52.570 --> 02:53:52.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:55.610 --> 02:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
that is probably true
 
02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:58.130 align:start position:0%
that is probably true
um

02:53:58.130 --> 02:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:03.710 --> 02:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:15.469 --> 02:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:17.450 --> 02:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
. all right so that's a candidate for
 
02:54:17.460 --> 02:54:18.889 align:start position:0%
. all right so that's a candidate for
admission

02:54:18.889 --> 02:54:18.899 align:start position:0%
admission
 
02:54:28.370 --> 02:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:30.530 --> 02:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
other candidates would be page three
 
02:54:34.010 --> 02:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.490 --> 02:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
oh yeah this is what we're do we're just
 
02:54:48.170 --> 02:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:51.769 --> 02:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
so that would require a new line 17. so
 
02:54:53.929 --> 02:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
I'll ask members of the Department of
 
02:54:56.210 --> 02:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
energy who are here
 
02:54:56.220 --> 02:54:58.429 align:start position:0%
energy who are here
if

02:54:58.429 --> 02:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
they think that they could help us
 
02:55:06.349 --> 02:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
create language about adding
 
02:55:09.370 --> 02:55:09.380 align:start position:0%
a new section F here to
 
02:55:12.590 --> 02:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
suggest that the commission consider
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
performance caps
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:27.710 --> 02:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
you need to think about that yep okay
 
02:55:30.889 --> 02:55:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
an addition that we would determine
 
02:55:39.969 --> 02:55:39.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
chairman if we are listing factors
 
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh that they can consider and just and
 
02:55:49.130 --> 02:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
reasonable we probably could add that as
 
02:55:52.670 --> 02:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
the puc should consider over market caps
 
02:55:52.680 --> 02:55:53.929 align:start position:0%
the puc should consider over market caps
right

02:55:53.929 --> 02:55:53.939 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:55:56.750 --> 02:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
on the cost of the PPA it just it's just
 
02:55:59.210 --> 02:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
a directive it's not trying to prescribe
 
02:56:01.429 --> 02:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
it I'm not sure we would be qualified to
 
02:56:05.090 --> 02:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
well your language says does the
 
02:56:10.370 --> 02:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
contract contain colon performance
 
02:56:12.590 --> 02:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
incentives for meeting cost projections
 
02:56:14.690 --> 02:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
and Generator penalties for
 
02:56:14.700 --> 02:56:16.490 align:start position:0%
and Generator penalties for
non-performance

02:56:16.490 --> 02:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
non-performance
 
02:56:20.750 --> 02:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:27.769 --> 02:56:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:31.450 --> 02:56:31.460 align:start position:0%
after non-performance you could insert
 
02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
consideration for over-market caps
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
on ppas and then it would be to protect
 
02:56:40.610 --> 02:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
rate payers right so you could insert it
 
02:56:41.990 --> 02:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
as another
 
02:56:43.969 --> 02:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
item for consideration there I think or
 
02:56:43.979 --> 02:56:46.429 align:start position:0%
item for consideration there I think or
consideration

02:56:46.429 --> 02:56:46.439 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:56:49.370 --> 02:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
yeah of
 
02:56:53.450 --> 02:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.790 --> 02:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:02.510 align:start position:0%
 
caps

02:57:02.510 --> 02:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:05.330 --> 02:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
over market energy
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
or consideration of over-market energy
 
02:57:11.450 --> 02:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
cost caps okay to protect rate payers
 
02:57:13.790 --> 02:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
from demand price spikes and promote
 
02:57:15.830 --> 02:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
delivery reliable service
 
02:57:19.070 --> 02:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
so it's just I'm not sure that
 
02:57:21.769 --> 02:57:21.779 align:start position:0%
over market caps would protect rate
 
02:57:24.830 --> 02:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
payers from demand price spikes
 
02:57:28.610 --> 02:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
but and promote the delivery of reliable
 
02:57:31.450 --> 02:57:31.460 align:start position:0%
service but
 
02:57:33.650 --> 02:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
low cost
 
02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
well you could just say to protect rate
 
02:57:37.730 --> 02:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
payers and promote delivery of reliable
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
Services if you don't think it modifies
 
02:57:43.849 --> 02:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
what's before it you know I mean
 
02:57:45.889 --> 02:57:45.899 align:start position:0%
so those of you who have had experience
 
02:57:48.530 --> 02:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
with the Public Utilities Commission in
 
02:57:49.490 --> 02:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
the past
 
02:57:54.950 --> 02:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
illustrative for the commission or would
 
02:57:58.250 --> 02:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
it be
 
02:58:01.490 --> 02:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
confusing to the commission
 
02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:03.410 align:start position:0%
confusing to the commission
neither

02:58:03.410 --> 02:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
neither
 
02:58:06.530 --> 02:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
of the latter it would be confusing
 
02:58:15.110 --> 02:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about words like over Market
 
02:58:19.309 --> 02:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
because this is a competitive bid
 
02:58:24.889 --> 02:58:24.899 align:start position:0%
process that goes to the puc and we I
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
truly anticipate that we'll be looking
 
02:58:29.389 --> 02:58:29.399 align:start position:0%
at markets forecast prices all the
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:35.510 --> 02:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
in truth we don't know what's going to
 
02:58:38.090 --> 02:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
be over Market or not over Market it's
 
02:58:39.830 --> 02:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
meant to have
 
02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
over the term of the contract net
 
02:58:43.849 --> 02:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
benefits to customers
 
02:58:46.610 --> 02:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
and that'll be fully explored by us by
 
02:58:50.290 --> 02:58:50.300 align:start position:0%
the OCA by Third Parties by the puc
 
02:58:53.450 --> 02:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
before the puc in adjudicative
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
proceeding so I'm not sure what language
 
02:58:59.870 --> 02:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
like that actually does
 
02:58:59.880 --> 02:59:02.269 align:start position:0%
like that actually does
just

02:59:02.269 --> 02:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:59:04.790 --> 02:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
well I think the the question arose
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
because recently we've all had some
 
02:59:10.250 --> 02:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
direct experience with the Burgess
 
02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
biopower PPA and we know it has
 
02:59:16.670 --> 02:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
a cap in it for over-market energy costs
 
02:59:20.210 --> 02:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
and so I think the question here is
 
02:59:22.309 --> 02:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
would something similar to that be
 
02:59:25.250 --> 02:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
useful for these ppas maybe it wouldn't
 
02:59:27.530 --> 02:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the question I think
 
02:59:30.530 --> 02:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
we're wrestling with right at the moment
 
02:59:30.540 --> 02:59:34.370 align:start position:0%
we're wrestling with right at the moment
um

02:59:34.370 --> 02:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:36.530 --> 02:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
and then there's always the question of
 
02:59:38.990 --> 02:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
even if you thought it did
 
02:59:41.809 --> 02:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
what what level was that what numbers
 
02:59:43.790 --> 02:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
put in there and are you going to chill
 
02:59:47.510 --> 02:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
a response of potential uh bidders on
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
the RFP with that
 
02:59:51.469 --> 02:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
I mean we can give it some more
 
02:59:54.889 --> 02:59:54.899 align:start position:0%
consideration uh
 
02:59:57.050 --> 02:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
backup Doe
 
02:59:59.389 --> 02:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
and and we will
 
03:00:02.330 --> 03:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
but those are my initial thoughts on it
 
03:00:04.790 --> 03:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
and we sort of and we sort of know
 
03:00:09.130 --> 03:00:09.140 align:start position:0%
in hindsight even with 100 million cap
 
03:00:12.170 --> 03:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
that's been problematic from all kinds
 
03:00:14.510 --> 03:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
of different angles
 
03:00:16.269 --> 03:00:16.279 align:start position:0%
obviously yes
 
03:00:18.650 --> 03:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
Mr locata did you have a comment about
 
03:00:27.710 --> 03:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:34.010 --> 03:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:36.250 --> 03:00:36.260 align:start position:0%
even the current additional language
 
03:00:40.370 --> 03:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
such as does the contract contain and
 
03:00:42.650 --> 03:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
then throwing this additional cap
 
03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
language in there
 
03:00:48.290 --> 03:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
you know would be worthy of perhaps more
 
03:00:51.010 --> 03:00:51.020 align:start position:0%
consideration and I I understand
 
03:00:53.030 --> 03:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
03:00:55.250 --> 03:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we have a problem with
 
03:00:59.150 --> 03:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:01.790 --> 03:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
should the utility when we're issuing an
 
03:01:05.330 --> 03:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
RFP if this language is a such as
 
03:01:08.570 --> 03:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
should the utility require that the
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
respondents have you know the contracts
 
03:01:13.730 --> 03:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
coming back have performance incentives
 
03:01:16.190 --> 03:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
meeting cost projections and penalties
 
03:01:18.410 --> 03:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
for non-con performance there are
 
03:01:20.210 --> 03:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
traditionally penalties for
 
03:01:22.730 --> 03:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
non-performance in these contracts it's
 
03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
just the
 
03:01:27.290 --> 03:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
the ambiguity of the language
 
03:01:30.050 --> 03:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
it might be difficult
 
03:01:33.170 --> 03:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I'd you know if we're
 
03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
expanding to include
 
03:01:37.550 --> 03:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
price caps
 
03:01:40.910 --> 03:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
Does it include price Caps or is it an
 
03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
example of something that could be
 
03:01:44.929 --> 03:01:44.939 align:start position:0%
considered you know there's just sort of
 
03:01:46.730 --> 03:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
regulatory ambiguity that's sort of
 
03:01:50.450 --> 03:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
building into this section so I I think
 
03:01:51.889 --> 03:01:51.899 align:start position:0%
we would just want to be I think the
 
03:01:53.690 --> 03:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
committee would want to be
 
03:01:53.700 --> 03:01:55.849 align:start position:0%
committee would want to be
cautious

03:01:55.849 --> 03:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
cautious
 
03:01:55.859 --> 03:01:59.690 align:start position:0%
cautious
um

03:01:59.690 --> 03:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
good point
 
03:02:02.809 --> 03:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
okay we'll
 
03:02:04.910 --> 03:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
we'll take
 
03:02:08.450 --> 03:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
that possible change
 
03:02:10.130 --> 03:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
we will study that possible change
 
03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:18.830 --> 03:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
and so I think that brings us to the
 
03:02:21.530 --> 03:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
point at which we need to discover to
 
03:02:24.050 --> 03:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
discuss rather what our next steps are
 
03:02:26.630 --> 03:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:02:28.070 --> 03:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:02:30.170 --> 03:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we have the option
 
03:02:32.510 --> 03:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
to try to come up with a recommendation
 
03:02:33.950 --> 03:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
03:02:37.309 --> 03:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
take to the full committee or I think a
 
03:02:39.410 --> 03:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
section a second option here would be to
 
03:02:42.230 --> 03:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
have another one of these work sessions
 
03:02:45.769 --> 03:02:45.779 align:start position:0%
to hammer out final issues final
 
03:02:45.779 --> 03:02:47.469 align:start position:0%
to hammer out final issues final
language

03:02:47.469 --> 03:02:47.479 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
consider a couple of other possible
 
03:02:53.450 --> 03:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
changes here the one that
 
03:02:55.910 --> 03:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
relates to Rex and the ones that that
 
03:02:58.730 --> 03:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
relates to potential
 
03:03:00.889 --> 03:03:00.899 align:start position:0%
over-market energy
 
03:03:06.110 --> 03:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:08.030 --> 03:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
now we could defer
 
03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
another meeting and just say no we'll
 
03:03:12.830 --> 03:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with deal with those other
 
03:03:14.929 --> 03:03:14.939 align:start position:0%
two issues at some other time
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
and then just try to come up with a
 
03:03:18.889 --> 03:03:18.899 align:start position:0%
single Amendment and a recommendation
 
03:03:21.950 --> 03:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
for the committee or we can
 
03:03:24.769 --> 03:03:24.779 align:start position:0%
have that second meeting
 
03:03:26.630 --> 03:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
what's what's the sense of the committee
 
03:03:28.190 --> 03:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
about whether you'd like to have a
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
second meeting or not
 
03:03:32.510 --> 03:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
03:03:34.849 --> 03:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I think we've
 
03:03:37.250 --> 03:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work on this and I think
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
these two issues are you know worthy of
 
03:03:45.349 --> 03:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
of improving this bill so that we have a
 
03:03:48.170 --> 03:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
a really solid bill that we can put
 
03:03:50.570 --> 03:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
forward in the Senate we'll just say
 
03:03:53.150 --> 03:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's great and everything will go
 
03:03:57.309 --> 03:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
along smoothly so I I think let's let's
 
03:04:00.650 --> 03:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
take take on these other two remaining
 
03:04:03.469 --> 03:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
issues and improve the bill so that
 
03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
would necess necessitate another meeting
 
03:04:07.730 --> 03:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
another meeting okay
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:15.469 --> 03:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Bernardi
 
03:04:15.479 --> 03:04:16.969 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Bernardi
okay

03:04:16.969 --> 03:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:04:19.490 --> 03:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
how do you guys feel I agree as well I
 
03:04:21.469 --> 03:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
agree all right so we will schedule
 
03:04:23.389 --> 03:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee meeting then for
 
03:04:28.130 --> 03:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
next Monday at 10 a May 1st at 10 A.M
 
03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
No 9 A.M
 
03:04:32.410 --> 03:04:32.420 align:start position:0%
no sense starting late
 
03:04:36.590 --> 03:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
9 A.M so bring your uh in and in the
 
03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
meantime we'll work with the Department
 
03:04:40.730 --> 03:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
of energy and others who are interested
 
03:04:43.490 --> 03:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh to help us maybe craft some language
 
03:04:46.130 --> 03:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
to incorporate these two ideas into the
 
03:04:46.140 --> 03:04:47.030 align:start position:0%
to incorporate these two ideas into the
bill

03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:04:51.110 --> 03:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go from there
 
03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
so Mr below you have a final closing
 
03:04:57.250 --> 03:04:57.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
if I may I just wanted to throw out a
 
03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
suggestion for you and all the other
 
03:05:04.490 --> 03:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the room to consider
 
03:05:07.550 --> 03:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
um now rather than wait a week
 
03:05:10.190 --> 03:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
um so on the renewable energy credit
 
03:05:10.200 --> 03:05:11.870 align:start position:0%
um so on the renewable energy credit
issue

03:05:11.870 --> 03:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
um where on the looking at the amendment
 
03:05:17.150 --> 03:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
at line 20 where it says shall sell such
 
03:05:19.370 --> 03:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
purchased energy and environmental
 
03:05:22.490 --> 03:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
attributes into the wholesale Market
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
this is at line 20 where it changes from
 
03:05:33.290 --> 03:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
May to Shell
 
03:05:33.300 --> 03:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
May to Shell
um

03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:33.570 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:33.570 --> 03:05:34.730 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

03:05:34.730 --> 03:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:05:38.510 --> 03:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
the utility shell sell such purchased
 
03:05:40.849 --> 03:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
energy and environmental attributes into
 
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market it could say there
 
03:05:46.670 --> 03:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
instead say say shall sell purchased
 
03:05:49.010 --> 03:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
energy and capacity into the wholesale
 
03:05:49.020 --> 03:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
energy and capacity into the wholesale
Market

03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
Market
 
03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and then uh have a new Roman five
 
03:05:57.170 --> 03:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
renumber the existing Roman five to six
 
03:06:00.230 --> 03:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
and it could just read pretty simply
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the extent any proposed uh purchase
 
03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
power agreement includes environmental
 
03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
attributes such such as Rex
 
03:06:14.330 --> 03:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
the puc or the commission shall approve
 
03:06:17.030 --> 03:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
how such environmental attributes are
 
03:06:20.690 --> 03:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
used or disposed of in a manner expected
 
03:06:23.809 --> 03:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
to minimize costs and maximize benefits
 
03:06:25.490 --> 03:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
to ratepayers
 
03:06:27.950 --> 03:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
so it would just leave
 
03:06:31.370 --> 03:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
the RFP open as to how that's resolved
 
03:06:33.230 --> 03:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
and it you know so the the utility could
 
03:06:35.150 --> 03:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
propose how we propose to deal with it
 
03:06:36.769 --> 03:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
if it has the attributes and the
 
03:06:38.750 --> 03:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
commission would approve it based on if
 
03:06:40.370 --> 03:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
it's an approach expected to minimize
 
03:06:43.370 --> 03:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
costs and maximize benefits so it leaves
 
03:06:46.370 --> 03:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
all the details for future determination
 
03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
okay could you read that language again
 
03:06:51.410 --> 03:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
and read it slowly okay to the extent
 
03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:55.080 --> 03:06:56.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:06:56.450 --> 03:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:58.670 --> 03:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
say it was going to go well it would go
 
03:07:01.070 --> 03:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
after Roman 4 on page three it would be
 
03:07:03.950 --> 03:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
Roman 5 and Roman existing Roman five
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
would become Romans 6.
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
so be just a new little uh section after
 
03:07:12.230 --> 03:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
a Roman 4 on page three
 
03:07:14.269 --> 03:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
do they extend to the extent any
 
03:07:16.130 --> 03:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
proposed I'm just trying to follow the
 
03:07:17.809 --> 03:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
language it says an agreement to
 
03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
purchase electric energy uh but any
 
03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:22.429 align:start position:0%
purchase electric energy uh but any
proposed

03:07:22.429 --> 03:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
03:07:24.050 --> 03:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
I guess those are the words being used
 
03:07:26.590 --> 03:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
agreement to purchase electric energy
 
03:07:30.410 --> 03:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
includes environmental attributes
 
03:07:32.690 --> 03:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
and and you could have a little you
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
could say such as renewable energy
 
03:07:35.870 --> 03:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
credits or not you could just say
 
03:07:39.010 --> 03:07:39.020 align:start position:0%
includes environmental attributes the
 
03:07:42.290 --> 03:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission
 
03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:43.849 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission
shell

03:07:43.849 --> 03:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
shell
 
03:07:43.859 --> 03:07:45.429 align:start position:0%
shell
approve

03:07:45.429 --> 03:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
approve
 
03:07:50.090 --> 03:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
how such environmental attributes are
 
03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
used or disposed of
 
03:07:56.510 --> 03:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
in a manner expected to minimize cost
 
03:07:59.090 --> 03:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
and maximize benefits to rate payers
 
03:08:01.070 --> 03:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay that's too fast could you send us
 
03:08:04.250 --> 03:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
that text in email I will do that
 
03:08:06.590 --> 03:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I have one other suggestion for your
 
03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:08.330 align:start position:0%
and I have one other suggestion for your
consideration

03:08:08.330 --> 03:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
um under Roman 2 that starts at the
 
03:08:13.730 --> 03:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two there's an A and A B
 
03:08:16.130 --> 03:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
and and I would ask your consideration
 
03:08:16.140 --> 03:08:17.330 align:start position:0%
and and I would ask your consideration
of

03:08:17.330 --> 03:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:17.929 align:start position:0%
of
um

03:08:17.929 --> 03:08:17.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:21.650 --> 03:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
a different B and remember B to C and
 
03:08:23.570 --> 03:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
this is just one even shorter sentence
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
so this would be near the top of Page
 
03:08:26.690 --> 03:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
Three where it's directing the
 
03:08:30.410 --> 03:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
commission uh to you know uh consider in
 
03:08:32.510 --> 03:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
an adjudicated proceeding
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
um whether to approve uh these contracts
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
and the the additional sub paragraph
 
03:08:40.210 --> 03:08:40.220 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
intervening parties that Supply Power
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
to retail customers
 
03:08:48.590 --> 03:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
03:08:51.769 --> 03:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
shall be afforded an opportunity
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
to independently evaluate
 
03:08:59.630 --> 03:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
the RFP responses and proposed PPA or in
 
03:09:05.150 --> 03:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:07.730 --> 03:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
priority permit public comment
 
03:09:07.740 --> 03:09:08.269 align:start position:0%
priority permit public comment
um

03:09:08.269 --> 03:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:12.410 align:start position:0%
on page two
lines

03:09:12.410 --> 03:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
lines
 
03:09:13.849 --> 03:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
three and four
 
03:09:16.010 --> 03:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
within this period the utility shall
 
03:09:18.110 --> 03:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
solicit public comment that that's
 
03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
public comment on the RFP that this is
 
03:09:21.300 --> 03:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
public comment on the RFP that this is
regarding

03:09:22.380 --> 03:09:22.390 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
03:09:22.390 --> 03:09:22.730 align:start position:0%
regarding
[Music]

03:09:22.730 --> 03:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:09:22.740 --> 03:09:23.510 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:27.769 --> 03:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
the once the RFP has gone forward a
 
03:09:30.469 --> 03:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
proposed agreement is put forward to the
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
commission for review and approval
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
and at line 36 at the bottom of page 2
 
03:09:37.550 --> 03:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
it says after notice and hearing which
 
03:09:39.230 --> 03:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
presumably means an adjudicated
 
03:09:42.110 --> 03:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
proceeding in which parties could
 
03:09:43.610 --> 03:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
intervene because they have an interest
 
03:09:45.349 --> 03:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
in it
 
03:09:45.359 --> 03:09:46.130 align:start position:0%
in it
um

03:09:46.130 --> 03:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:48.889 --> 03:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
that those parties be afforded an
 
03:09:51.590 --> 03:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to evaluate
 
03:09:55.309 --> 03:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
the proposed art agreement which sort of
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
means that they have an opportunity to
 
03:09:59.570 --> 03:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
access the the data that's used in such
 
03:10:01.849 --> 03:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
an analysis so that you kind of have
 
03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
another set of ideas I eyes I mean on
 
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
the proposal from from parties who
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
actually have a stake because they're
 
03:10:13.330 --> 03:10:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to need email with that okay
 
03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
language and please use the amendment
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
yes 14.
 
03:10:25.849 --> 03:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
64 H as the basis and specify exactly
 
03:10:29.389 --> 03:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
what page and line that the okay new
 
03:10:31.969 --> 03:10:31.979 align:start position:0%
text would would apply to I appreciate
 
03:10:35.330 --> 03:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you to recognize that we
 
03:10:37.490 --> 03:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
did made make some changes to that
 
03:10:40.849 --> 03:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
already yeah yes well there'll be
 
03:10:42.530 --> 03:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
another amendment
 
03:10:44.330 --> 03:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
as long as they start from the same
 
03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
starting place no I I think we could we
 
03:10:50.389 --> 03:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
could make these changes to this
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
amendment yes add them to this amendment
 
03:10:54.830 --> 03:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah which would obviously require a new
 
03:10:56.269 --> 03:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to require a new Amendment
 
03:10:57.469 --> 03:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
anyway because we've already made
 
03:10:59.330 --> 03:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
changes but
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:07.070 --> 03:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
is there any reaction
 
03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
from anyone
 
03:11:11.450 --> 03:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
with regard to the changes Mr Blue just
 
03:11:11.460 --> 03:11:13.190 align:start position:0%
with regard to the changes Mr Blue just
suggested

03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
03:11:20.690 --> 03:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:23.809 --> 03:11:23.819 align:start position:0%
just just that that sounds like a
 
03:11:27.370 --> 03:11:27.380 align:start position:0%
massive confidentiality issue and would
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
essentially be opening one company's
 
03:11:34.370 --> 03:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
books up to a competitor in in a very
 
03:11:36.830 --> 03:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
large way as I understand the proposal
 
03:11:40.969 --> 03:11:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:43.730 --> 03:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
okay that's a potential issue
 
03:11:43.740 --> 03:11:45.410 align:start position:0%
okay that's a potential issue
um

03:11:45.410 --> 03:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:47.570 --> 03:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
we'll have to think about that consider
 
03:11:47.580 --> 03:11:49.130 align:start position:0%
we'll have to think about that consider
it

03:11:49.130 --> 03:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:11:53.330 --> 03:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:55.610 --> 03:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
any reaction to the suggestion that we
 
03:11:55.620 --> 03:11:57.410 align:start position:0%
any reaction to the suggestion that we
add

03:11:57.410 --> 03:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
add
 
03:12:02.450 --> 03:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
a new section five on page three that
 
03:12:04.670 --> 03:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
03:12:09.550 --> 03:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes and approving
 
03:12:12.769 --> 03:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
those Mr locata
 
03:12:12.779 --> 03:12:19.309 align:start position:0%
those Mr locata
gotcha

03:12:19.309 --> 03:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:22.790 --> 03:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
so like all of you sort of reacting as
 
03:12:24.290 --> 03:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing it
 
03:12:26.269 --> 03:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
um it seemed
 
03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh it seemed a reasonable approach I
 
03:12:30.530 --> 03:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
think there I did hear a reference to
 
03:12:32.809 --> 03:12:32.819 align:start position:0%
capacity that is not included in the
 
03:12:35.630 --> 03:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
procurement that we would would not want
 
03:12:37.849 --> 03:12:37.859 align:start position:0%
its energy and potentially environmental
 
03:12:42.410 --> 03:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
attributes but I think the approach
 
03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
um that Mr Bulow is is lying out
 
03:12:47.090 --> 03:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:12:47.100 --> 03:12:48.530 align:start position:0%
you know
basically

03:12:48.530 --> 03:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
pushing it off to the commission to kind
 
03:12:52.490 --> 03:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
of sort it out among the parties is not
 
03:12:54.769 --> 03:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
not a bad one on the environmental
 
03:12:54.779 --> 03:12:56.929 align:start position:0%
not a bad one on the environmental
attributes

03:12:56.929 --> 03:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
attributes
 
03:13:00.290 --> 03:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:02.269 --> 03:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay so if you could give us that
 
03:13:04.130 --> 03:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
language Mr below
 
03:13:06.170 --> 03:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
maybe without
 
03:13:06.180 --> 03:13:08.870 align:start position:0%
maybe without
um

03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:16.550 --> 03:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:16.560 --> 03:13:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:13:19.550 --> 03:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:19.560 --> 03:13:28.309 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:13:28.309 --> 03:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:28.319 --> 03:13:31.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:13:31.610 --> 03:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
all right so is there anything else
 
03:13:36.230 --> 03:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
anybody would like to say anybody
 
03:13:38.809 --> 03:13:38.819 align:start position:0%
assembled here or any members of the
 
03:13:41.090 --> 03:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee Mr representative
 
03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:42.650 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee Mr representative
partial

03:13:42.650 --> 03:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
partial
 
03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm just uh curious as well
 
03:13:47.570 --> 03:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
they're not the working group
 
03:13:49.610 --> 03:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
would like to I think I think it
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
particularly right stop by the way is
 
03:13:52.610 --> 03:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
there any appetite for addressing
 
03:14:00.769 --> 03:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.030 --> 03:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
personally I say no but I'm open to
 
03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
other reactions from subcommittee
 
03:14:07.260 --> 03:14:11.210 align:start position:0%
other reactions from subcommittee
members

03:14:11.210 --> 03:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:12.889 --> 03:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
I know there's other legislation
 
03:14:14.389 --> 03:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
floating around that addresses
 
03:14:14.399 --> 03:14:15.490 align:start position:0%
floating around that addresses
transmission

03:14:15.490 --> 03:14:15.500 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
03:14:18.590 --> 03:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
costs and and uh
 
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
transmission credits Etc so I I think we
 
03:14:23.450 --> 03:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
should I think
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
the changes we're proposing to make this
 
03:14:28.849 --> 03:14:28.859 align:start position:0%
bill are pretty significant
 
03:14:28.859 --> 03:14:30.410 align:start position:0%
bill are pretty significant
um

03:14:30.410 --> 03:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
the governor the department of energy I
 
03:14:35.090 --> 03:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
don't know how they're going to the
 
03:14:36.349 --> 03:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
Senate I don't know how they're going to
 
03:14:41.389 --> 03:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
react to these these changes so uh I I'd
 
03:14:43.550 --> 03:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
say at this point let's not plan to make
 
03:14:45.889 --> 03:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
any more changes other than possibly the
 
03:14:48.710 --> 03:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
two that Mr below suggested
 
03:14:50.450 --> 03:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
because I think it's going to be a
 
03:14:50.460 --> 03:14:52.370 align:start position:0%
because I think it's going to be a
pretty

03:14:52.370 --> 03:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
significant lift for some people when
 
03:14:56.990 --> 03:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
they see the changes we're proposing to
 
03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:01.070 align:start position:0%
they see the changes we're proposing to
make

03:15:01.070 --> 03:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay anything else
 
03:15:06.290 --> 03:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
so let's plan to reassemble here on
 
03:15:09.530 --> 03:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
Monday May 1st at 9 00 a.m to hammer it
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
hammer out the final language for a an
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that we will propose to the
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.960 --> 03:15:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:15:20.030 --> 03:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:15:23.210 --> 03:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
we could call in the full committee that
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
day to have an exact session
 
03:15:28.190 --> 03:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
what what does the committee think about
 
03:15:28.200 --> 03:15:30.710 align:start position:0%
what what does the committee think about
that

03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:32.809 --> 03:15:32.819 align:start position:0%
great idea
 
03:15:35.929 --> 03:15:35.939 align:start position:0%
okay so I will also schedule an
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:42.410 align:start position:0%
 
pardon

03:15:42.410 --> 03:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
03:15:43.910 --> 03:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to need to vote how
 
03:15:43.920 --> 03:15:50.870 align:start position:0%
we're not going to need to vote how
about

03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:58.429 --> 03:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:02.030 --> 03:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
what time is your uh
 
03:16:09.530 --> 03:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:18.290 --> 03:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
we could do the exact session at two
 
03:16:18.300 --> 03:16:20.389 align:start position:0%
we could do the exact session at two
o'clock

03:16:20.389 --> 03:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
03:16:22.130 --> 03:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
because that way we could we could have
 
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
all morning to hammer out the details of
 
03:16:27.170 --> 03:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
this language get it over to OLS so that
 
03:16:29.929 --> 03:16:29.939 align:start position:0%
they can hammer out the new Amendment we
 
03:16:32.330 --> 03:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
can all go have a leisurely lunch and
 
03:16:33.710 --> 03:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
then come back here at two o'clock for
 
03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
exec session
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
that sound reasonable
 
03:16:40.130 --> 03:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
done deal
 
03:16:43.309 --> 03:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
okay that's the plan then
 
03:16:47.389 --> 03:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
so I'll get that in the works with um
 
03:16:49.730 --> 03:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
Christy and and the other
 
03:16:52.250 --> 03:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
folks on the house Community Committee
 
03:16:55.190 --> 03:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
services staff and we'll get that the
 
03:16:57.230 --> 03:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
calendar for next week
 
03:17:00.170 --> 03:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I think with that we can officially
 
03:17:02.450 --> 03:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
draw this meeting to a close and I want
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
to thank everybody for your
 
03:17:06.170 --> 03:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
