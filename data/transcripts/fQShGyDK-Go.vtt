you for your time today to speak
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
regarding the covid response in my city
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
of nasua New Hampshire I will be frank
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
the handling of covid in the city of
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
nasua was a thing of nightmares for many
 
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
adults parents and most importantly for
 
00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.390 align:start position:0%
adults parents and most importantly for
our

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
children from March of 2020 to February
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
of 2021 the ntional school district
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
refused to reopen at a full-time
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
capacity for in-person learning it
 
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't until Governor sununu issued an
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
emergency order for a return to school
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
that forced the hand of the district to
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
reopen for its students that should not
 
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
have been the case you see from March of
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
2020 to February of 2021 Nashville Board
 
00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
of Education comprised at the time of
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
mostly Democratic elected individuals
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
there were thousands of children who
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
went without the opportunity to learn
 
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 align:start position:0%
freely in any classroom environment
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
including remotely the Board of
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
Education in my city never received
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
thousands of taxpayer funded Chromebooks
 
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
which left children without the ability
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
to learn additionally children did not
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
have accessibility to internet in some
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
lowincome areas they essentially
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
declined to make adjustments to afford
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
all NASA children a fair opportunity at
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
their right to free public free
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education they simply
 
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.110 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education they simply
didn't

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
care now I'm not simply I'm not simply
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
saying this out of spite I am saying
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
this from a place of critical thought
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
and after years of reflection on how
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
this could have been more appropriately
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
handled they could have done better they
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
could have treated those of us who spoke
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
out in opposition better they could have
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
been better and overall chose not to do
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
so along with many other state
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
representatives through throughout New
 
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in other cities and towns the
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
city of NASA imposed a Citywide mask
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
mandate for over a year regardless of
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
data provided to at the time mayor
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
appointed director of Public Health
 
00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
Bobby Bagley at many points throughout
 
00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
the pandemic questions were asked
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
surrounding the validity of the metrics
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
being used to Monitor and determine
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
reopening plans and mandates all of
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
those questions went unanswered and when
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
provided direct responses from Cheryl
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
Cheryl neelsen and Elizabeth Maynard at
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
Services specifically laboratory
 
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
services which handled the results of
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire testing Miss baggley
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
remained steadfast in her directive of
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
keeping nashaa closed and masked New
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire never calculated the overall
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
CT viral load value when determining the
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
actual transmissibility of covid-19 ever
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
I say this as someone who probed the
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
questions alongside hundreds of others
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
and yet even with proof of inflated and
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
inaccurate numbers many felt as though
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
we were screaming from the rooftops and
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
no one was listening at this time
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
history and virology were thrown out the
 
00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
window in addition to deliberately
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
ignoring specific email responses to
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
questions asked at the state level with
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
confirmation that the data that was
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
being used was not accurate and that we
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
were not actually able to appropriately
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
calculate for transmissibility rates
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
without the CT VI without the CT viral
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
load values the ways in which those who
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
spoke out were treated was abhorent we
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
can do better
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
as someone who was never involved in
 
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
politics prior to covid-19 my only
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of becoming involved was to
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
benefit the children of nasua my
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
involvement and speaking out ultimately
 
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
resulted in elected officials including
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
state representatives labeling myself
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
and others as white supremacist
 
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
neo-nazis who belonged to what they
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
referred as teacher sacrificing Cults
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
simply because we wanted children to
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
have access to their classrooms again in
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
person it was one of the worst
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
experiences of my entire entire life
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
myself and my best friend received death
 
00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
threats we were cyber stocked we were
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
doxed by state representatives teachers
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
targeted us and our children and so much
 
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
more all because we spoke up because and
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
advocated for a return to inperson
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
learning children went without learning
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
which resulted in later confirmed
 
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
learning loss the isolation of denial of
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
access to social settings for children
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
resulted in later confirmed mental
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
health challenges the implementation of
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
mandatory vaccines for employment
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
resulted in thousands of lost jobs for
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
people throughout the state regardless
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
of information that was provided to
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives elected officials and
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
appointed leaders in our communities we
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
were simply ignored and later realized
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
and confirmed our data points and
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
research but never even bothered to
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledge any wrongdoings or apologize
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire residents for
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
mishandling any outcomes or committed
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
denial of fact of facts as I sit here
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
before you today after taking time to
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
reflect on the pandemic responses and
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
the handling of covid-19 I again say we
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
could have done better we should have
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
done better many ask for honesty
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
transparency accurate statistics and
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
overall human decency we were mostly met
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
with labels threats and so much more I
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
implore this committee to also reflect
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
on the outcomes of handling of the
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic and to do better in the future
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I yield to any
 
00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:32.110 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I yield to any
questions

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
you for the testimony in
 
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
hindsight what would you recommend could
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
be done differently because when we get
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
into something like this there are
 
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion and how do we
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
resolve that difference of opinion and
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
still respect each other's rights so you
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
have any
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
solutions I would I would say that
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
reviewing the facts um and being
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
open-minded um there was a lot of
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
closed-mindedness again reflecting back
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
on how we could have done things
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
differently it was a very emotional time
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
for a lot of us um but to give an
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
example we were given specific data and
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
facts and it would have been better
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
suited for people to read the data and
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
facts as elected officials taking out
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
the political biases um and looking at
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
it at face value because the thing is we
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
didn't focus on the accurate numbers and
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
going forward in the future if you look
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
at the accurate numbers and the
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
statistics and what needs to be
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
calculated in a situation like that um
 
00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
specifically CT values um viral load uh
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
if those things are not being calculated
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
and we're basing our decisions on
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
closing or reopening or mandates um
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
things along those lines if you don't
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
calculate in the things that matter in
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
order to determine the transmissibility
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
rate and we ignore those facts
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
regardless of differing opinions numbers
 
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.389 align:start position:0%
regardless of differing opinions numbers
don't

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:04.189 align:start position:0%
don't
lie

00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
lie
 
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
followup that's insightful so thank you
 
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
do you think this is something that
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
should be done by the state or done by
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
local municipalities because I'm a
 
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
strong believer in local control and not
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
having the state trumpet over
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
municipality's rights so in hindsight
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
again is this something that really
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
should be done broadly at the state
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
level and take away that autonomy of the
 
00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:28.519 align:start position:0%
municipality or should it reside at in
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
the municipality and municipality have
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
the resources to actually do what you're
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
recommending so that that's a difficult
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
question for me to answer um I although
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
I agree with local control I think that
 
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's a magnitude that goes
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
along with that because every area is
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
different and every area needs something
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
different um I think that there could
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
have been a standard set um by the state
 
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
that the cities should have followed um
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire specifically
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
Services um I have emails I would be
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
more than happy to send anybody the
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
email confirmation that needs it um I
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
have to go back into the archives it's
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
from 2021 so um but setting a standard
 
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
at the state level of how the tests are
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
going to be handled and what statistics
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
need to be there in order to determine
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not we reopen or we close
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
schools or mandate masking um like I
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
said I have the email we ask
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
specifically what needs to be calculated
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
in order to determine transmissibility
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
and if that had been done at the state
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
level for cities like my myself um again
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
it was a very emotional time um I think
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
although local control matters a lot to
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
me our local control didn't listen to us
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of the facts that we
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
presented forward from the state of New
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so yes I would say local
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
control matters um but at the state
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
level we really needed a benchmark um
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
things like the reopening Mandate of
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
schools that um Governor senu had the
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
executive order those things could have
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
happened sooner on so that the kids
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
didn't suffer all that period of
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony this morning uh
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
to follow up uh a little further with
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
the idea of the local control question I
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
guess I I would ask as far as what you
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
think the extent of that should be given
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
for instance that um the New Hampshire
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice has a civil rights
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
Division and they regularly will file
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
civil rights charges against people all
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
over the state for various violations or
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
or alleged violations um at the state
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
level do you feel like your civil rights
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
were respected during this process so
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question um I was
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
actually one of the ones um that pointed
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
people into the direction of the Civil
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
Rights um spe specifically the
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center um to file uh
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
requests for comprehensive services for
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
students that were without in-person
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
learning and at the detriment of their
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
children did I specifically have my
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
civil rights violated um in a lot of
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
ways sure um you know mandating
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
different types of things wearing a mask
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
um in order to go to the grocery store
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
because of a mask mandate um not being
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
able to move about freely um to exercise
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
My First Amendment right those types of
 
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
things were absolutely restricted um I
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
would like to keep it specific right now
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
to the children um there were a lot of
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
civil rights that were violated um to
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
give you an example on a personal level
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
um I had a child who had a disability I
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
had a letter from his pediatrician
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
that it was a mask exemption letter it
 
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:47.959 align:start position:0%
was provided to the Nashville School
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
District my child was chased down
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
hallways he was called the wrong last
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
name because I am who I am um and I
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
spoke up he was denied the ability he
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
was left outside to sit outside by
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
himself at 16 years old um could I
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
pursue different Avenues to seek legal
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
action yes do I have the ability to
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
afford doing that as a single parent in
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire absolutely not um there
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
were a lot of civil rights that were
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
violated um comprehensive services in my
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
city were automatically denied there was
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
a blanket letter that was sent out for
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
any special education student um I again
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
I I'm more than happy to share any of
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
this I'm not just talking out of the
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
seat of my pants these are things that
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
we experienced in real time um but yes
 
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
to answer your question in a long-winded
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
way um there were civil rights that were
 
00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:40.909 align:start position:0%
way um there were civil rights that were
violated

00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
violated
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely represent
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair and also
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question during
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
the testimony what I heard was that
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
there was an issue with Chromebooks and
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
not having availability to them which
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
brings up another issue do you believe
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
would you speak to the fact that a lot
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
of Educational Funding is done locally
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
and not by the state should the state be
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
responsible providing sort of a platform
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
of technology to be sure we have a Level
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
Playing Field we don't have a technology
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
Gap so students have the ability to use
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
that technology when they need to should
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
it be a state responsibility should it
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
be something by local
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities so again another really
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
great question the problem with that is
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
um bringing it back to local control it
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
would be really difficult for the state
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
to mandate something along those lines
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
um specific to you need to have X Y and
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
Z in order to have these children um
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
doing these things because the reality
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
is funding is going to look different no
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
matter depending on where you are
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
Lichfield is going to look different
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
than Hudson Hudson's going to look
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
different than nasua um could we have in
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
the future if this were to happen um
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
have an oversight to ensure that
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
children have their fundamental right to
 
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
fape free appropriate public education I
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
think that that would be something that
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
maybe a committee of some kind could be
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
developed not necessarily to demand
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
certain actions be taken with taxpayer
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
funds but to ensure that um in an
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
example of the Esser funds they needed
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
to provide documentation to the
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education on how those
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
funds were spent um maybe doing some
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
kind of audit to ensure that those funds
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
were spent appropriately to benefit the
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
children um I know that in nashaa uh a
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the funding was used to um
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
provide teacher payment which is
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
fantastic teachers are wonderful we need
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
them obviously um but there were
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of children that
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
went out went without Chromebooks um
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
that were purchased but were never
 
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
received so I think that some kind of
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
oversight might be helpful as a
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
directive not as a demand but kind of
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
like a liaison to assist communities uh
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they're doing what's best
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
children represent
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
leus thank you for coming in um can you
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
give more specific harms that were done
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
during that time specifics of various
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
kids or your own child that
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
um particularly any long-term harms or
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
Etc so um my children are going to be so
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
bummed out that I'm talking about them
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
they're so tired of it but um my my
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
oldest son was the one with a mask
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
exemption um so a perfect example would
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
be um he would go to school to learn he
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
had a mask exemption I provided that
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
documentation there were no reasonable
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
accommodations that were made um there
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
are so many laws that that that were
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
violated through that um but the
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
long-term lasting effects um he doesn't
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
want to speak up anymore the idea of
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
standing up for something is terrifying
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
to him the idea of me standing up
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
sitting not standing but sitting here in
 
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:11.799 align:start position:0%
front of you today um makes my hands
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
clammy it makes me nervous um I'm
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
worried that there will be a Target
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
painted on my back again um that someone
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere because of differences of
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
opinions um will will get the bright
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
idea of sharing my address or my phone
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
number with someone um that I will have
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
to look over my shoulder um to make sure
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
that the death threats that I received
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
back then um were not followed through
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
on um so there are long-term effects uh
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
our youngest son is very very shy uh he
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
missed out on he was during covid he was
 
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
in the fifth grade uh at the tail end of
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
fifth grade when everything happened uh
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
he didn't return back to school again
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
for almost a year he lost a year he's a
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
very shy kid um he has a really hard
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
time making friends um they lost a lot
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
of that social interaction uh I have
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
friends uh who have children that were
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
younger going into kindergarten um and
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
from firsthand experiences they have
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
delayed learning we have uh a 63%
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
proficiency rate um in I believe it's
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
math uh there's like a 42% proficiency
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
rate for nasua and and again I'm
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
spitballing I don't have the numbers
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
directly in front of me um for reading
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
and those types of things are going
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
going to take years to redo there were
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
no comprehensive services for the
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
special education students um so those
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
long-term effects are going to be long
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
lasting things you know um occupational
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
therapy was missed you can't do speech
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
therapy through uh with a child who is a
 
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:47.559 align:start position:0%
visual learner through a computer um if
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
you had a lower income and you didn't
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
have access to a Chromebook you didn't
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
have access to an education um so
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
speaking specifically to my family um my
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
children were dramatically impacted I
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
was dramatically impacted um I even you
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
know things like looking for a job there
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
are things out there that were put out
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
into the world that were not true
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
because of differences of opinions
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
because I spoke up uh during a time when
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
we needed the facts and we needed the
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
logic and I was trying to help and Aid
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh with probing questions and emails
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
from you know heads of departments that
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
proved that we weren't accurately
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
reflecting the numbers it's terrifying
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's scary to sit up here today and in
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
front of all of you and whoever's
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
watching um but those those things are
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
going to last a lifetime so I hope that
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
that answered your
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative eel
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry those things
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
happened and um I even in the best of
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances it can be hard to sit here
 
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
and after what you uh went through I you
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
know I'm
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
sympathetic um so you know we're not
 
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
experts at this and so I'm just I was
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
just going through the timeline here of
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
emergency orders uh when vaccines first
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
became available and I'm just wondering
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
so it says here um in February of 2021
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
cunu issued an emergency order mandating
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
schools offer in-person instructions to
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
all students at least two days a week
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
starting March 8th 2021 I was just
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
curious as far as NASA was concerned
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
what Nashua did and were you wanting
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
them to open before that or hoping they
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
would open before that or did they not
 
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
comply with the order I was just trying
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
to think of how all that played out so I
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
sat in my car today for like an hour
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
trying to look back um you know it's
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
kind of like that whole I hate using
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
PTSD but you get PTSD when you we feel
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
it just when you go back into the
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
archives and you're like wait I can't
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
remember the date and I need to remember
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
the date so um we did not return to
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
impers learning until the executive
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
order and I don't remember exactly what
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
date it was um it was a 3:00 p.m. uh
 
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh Governor cunu required
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
that all schools return to full-time
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
in-person learning by April of of
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
2021 um it wasn't until that that
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
emergency order was made that the
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
children returned back to school at a
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
full-time capacity um even special
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
education students that should have had
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to go back to school um
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
I believe there was an additional
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
executive order at some or emergency
 
00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
order at some point I can't remember
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
which one it was the numbers all come
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
together um but the special education
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
students were afforded the opportunity
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
to go back sooner than that um and again
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
nasua refused to reopen at the directive
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
of our director of Public Health Bobby
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
baggley and the um metrics that she set
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
forward until Governor sonunu required
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
that they return to full-time by April
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
of 2021 because I was I mean we can look
 
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
more at this but I was trying to figure
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
out when um the limitations on public
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
Gatherings were you know uh repealed and
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
how that worked into the options for
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
schools to get back into session if they
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to I do see that the vaccines
 
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
weren't really available until like
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
February of 2021 I talk about PTSD I'm
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
reading this huge
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
no um so the other thing I wanted to ask
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
you is do you have and I realized you're
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
not an expert anymore than we are but do
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
you have a sense of how many other
 
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
schools other than nashaa actually
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
reopened and was was nashaa sort of a
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
lagard nashille is one of the last
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
school districts to open full-time um
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
all of the other school districts um I
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that other representatives in
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
in different areas um could speak to
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
when they reopened NASA was forced to
 
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
reopen if the governor had not made that
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
order I will answer bluntly nashaa was
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
not reopening the schools until someone
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
made them reopen the schools so just one
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
more so we um just obtained the after
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
action report that homeland security has
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
been working on for several months
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
through a consultant and um I haven't
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
read it all but it looks like yeah maybe
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
you have uh but apparently there there's
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
a task force and there
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
they're looking into all of these things
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
um not just schools but in general so
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
you might want to take a look at that uh
 
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
after Action Report um be interesting
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
from your perspective to see what you
 
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%
think as far as the schools but I'm
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
hopeful that by doing this work um we're
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
going to get some help in figuring all
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
this out for the
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
future I I I would love a copy of that
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure um representative leas would
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
send me that over if possible or I can
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
research it um you know one of the
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
things that we hadn't talked about that
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
that I'll add on to your request and how
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
we could handle things differently a lot
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
of jobs were lost um without a lot of
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
data and facts and and statistics and
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
and when you talk about the vaccines
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
because you had mentioned the vaccines
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
um some of the things that as parents
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
who had been doing the research um
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
things like the National Institute of
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
Health quietly researching the impacts
 
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
of this this um this vaccination uh
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
specifically I believe it's Johnson and
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
Johnson and you can research it and and
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
look into it um and it's impact and
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
effects on uh the menstrual cycles of
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
females um that has now since expanded
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh so I would definitely encourage you
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
to look into that study uh additionally
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh the studies regarding
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
myocarditis um and I had taken my son to
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
a uh physical and on the back of the
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
handout that they hand you after years
 
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
of saying the new the National Institute
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
of Health is is studying whether or not
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
there are you know potential
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
interactions or links to myocarditis it
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
lists it right on the back um so it was
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
an incredibly difficult time for all of
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
us um there's a lot of research that we
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
have now that we didn't have back then
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
um my big thing would be focusing on how
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
this impacts the children in the future
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
um you know social interactions mental
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
health uh there was a lot of mental
 
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
health crises during that period of time
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of uh lost learning a
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
lot of things that are going to take
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
years and years to undo if we can ever
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
undo them or repair them um so that
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
would be something that I would implore
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
this committee to do is to continue
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
doing the research read um that uh the
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
report from the task force um through
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Homeland Security um
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
and just keep yourselves educated at the
 
00:29:59.950 --> 00:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
same time as keeping yourself
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
open-minded um we didn't need to make
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
this political it didn't need to be a
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
right versus left it needed to be a how
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
do we help the kids and how do we make
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
sure that these kids have the things
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
that they need in order to continue
 
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
learning to grow um because they were
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
inhibited with a lot of things uh and
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
education represent
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you madam chair and just to uh
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
just to help clarify timeline and
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
whatnot I've just sent an email to the
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee to reading to the record a New
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Radio article from
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
November 9th of
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
20120 um in which it describes that many
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
districts in New Hampshire are open at
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
least for now with the hybrid are fully
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
inperson model but Nashua School disc
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
REM school districts have remained
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
closed since March so November and I
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
believe the testimony is that they
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
didn't open up until March or April of
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
21 so it looks like they would have been
 
00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:00.039 align:start position:0%
definitely one of the later um districts
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
to reopen I believe that when I was
 
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
looking through um in in the research um
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
I believe it might have been closer to
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
February um but it definitely was after
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh and and the only reason why I'm
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
saying this is because I I received a
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
phone call from the governor's office
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
saying you you girls won the schools
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
have to reopen um because we essentially
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
um sent every single email uh courtesy
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
copying uh the governor and then many
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
many many other Representatives
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
um so March might be a stretch um but I
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
do believe it was in February at some
 
00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
that well I would like to thank you for
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
being here and um coming out and telling
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
your story I do have a couple of
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
questions for you and I'm not sure if
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
you can answer them or not but school
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
districts were giving an awful lot of
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
arpa funds
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
help with a lot of the mitigation and to
 
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.629 align:start position:0%
help with a lot of the mitigation and to
help

00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
students um I think I heard and you
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I'm wrong is that
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
nashor purchased Chromebooks but they
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
did not distribute them is that a
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
correct statement on my part so nashaa
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
purchased I can't remember the exact
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
number um my I'm trying to go back and
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
and remember but there was so much um
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
Nasha purchased Chromebooks uh from a
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
company and those Chrome books were not
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
received Additionally the Chromebooks
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
that were distributed were never there
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
was no enforce of actions to obtain them
 
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh families at the end of
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
2021 um were sent a letter uh that said
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
hey you still have a Chromebook turn it
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
in or else uh and and those Chromebooks
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of them many many of them I don't
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
know the exact number I can find it if I
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
really wanted to um but a lot of those
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks were never returned so those
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks were not received for the
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
district so okay so they ordered them
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
but they were never sent them do you
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
know if they were paid for um I would
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
have to look into um I would have to
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
look into the how the S Sesser money was
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
spent um I do have a couple of board of
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
education members that I can reach out
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
to I do believe that they were received
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
much later on um at a time when we
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
really didn't need them because the kids
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
were already back to school at that
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
point um but I do know that I believe
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
that they were paid for and received at
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
a later time but they were not received
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
in in a timely manner when the kids were
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
in remote learning when it was essential
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
for them to to have access to those okay
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that do you know um
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
because we are talking about the
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
children and we're talking about the
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety of everybody in the
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
schools do you know if any of the money
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
was spent on air filtration systems to
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
try and mitigate um the viruses in the
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
classroom so that that people could
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
return sooner rather than later so they
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
did use uh some of the funds to update
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
the HVAC systems I do know um that some
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
of that funding was utilized for that
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
and in several of the schools there were
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
some schools that were up to date that
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
had been previously um updated prior to
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
covid uh but I do know that some of the
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
HVAC systems were
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
um were updated okay um I guess some um
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
HVAC system is being updated is good but
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
did they I guess the question is is did
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
they put air filtration s
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh in those systems uh which would help
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh right so ju that's just a question
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
that I have um and I'm sure you can't
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
answer that so yeah I'm I'm not sure um
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
I know that if the HVAC system was
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
installed I would I would hope that
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
someone somewhere with the SR funds
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
would have said we need to add a
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
filtration system but I'm not I can't
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
confirm it I mean they are you can look
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
at what was and was not spent uh through
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
the department of uh education in New
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on uh where the covid money
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
was spent through the documents that
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
they were required to submit prior to
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
the release of the
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
funding um I know uh listen in listening
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
to your testimony and hearing uh that
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
you were threatened
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
I hear I seem to hear that more and
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
more um from
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
people that wanted to get back to school
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
or that were outspoken
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
um we're in a very volatile uh political
 
00:35:44.359 --> 00:35:45.950 align:start position:0%
um we're in a very volatile uh political
environment

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.270 align:start position:0%
environment
unfortunately

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
um and do you think that the government
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
whether it be at the state or the
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
federal level helped in Institute fear
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
that trickled down so that that is
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
really What affected people
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
um doing those things to you and do you
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
think because I don't know we can't stop
 
00:36:11.319 --> 00:36:12.750 align:start position:0%
think because I don't know we can't stop
people

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
from their opinions we all have
 
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
different opinions we're unique we all
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
have different
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
biases um based on our
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
situations but where do you think that
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
originated if you had to
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
if you thought about it um why it became
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
so prevalent and for you personally
 
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
because you were one of those outspoken
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
parents um I think that there was a
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
certain level of uh of fear-based
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
information uh it depends on where you
 
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:47.079 align:start position:0%
look it depends on where you're getting
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
your your facts and and your information
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
um there's still fear that goes along
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
with it even with the research and the
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
the evidence that we have that supports
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the claims that people like
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
myself were making um back then I think
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
that there was um there was a political
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
divide uh and unfortunately not many
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
people in that point in time uh could
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
walk in what my friends and I and and
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
people that I spoke with that are
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
like-minded not a lot of people could
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
walk in a gray area it was very much a
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
right versus left um and a lot of people
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
that you know uh were unfortunately I I
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
I'll speak Frank um a lot of the people
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
that were in the Democratic party did
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
have a very fear-based
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
response um based on what they were
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
being told um we were told that this is
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
one of the deadliest viruses ever um I
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
don't remember what the end uh statistic
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
was but a virus with a 99 something per
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
survival rate um that that is a very
 
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.790 align:start position:0%
survival rate um that that is a very
fear-driven

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
fear-driven
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
narrative um thinking about how the
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
numbers and the information was reported
 
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
added to additional fear um to give you
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
an example you could have gotten bit by
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
an alligator and go to the hospital um
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
for an alligator bite obviously not in
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but um to go to the
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
hospital with an alligator bite and
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
being treated for an alligator bite but
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
if you tested positive for covid and you
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
died from the alligator bite it has been
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
proven that sometimes those deaths
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
counted as a covid related death so
 
00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.079 align:start position:0%
there was a level of fear um and there
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
was a level of refusal to acknowledge
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
facts and logic um and and critical
 
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
thinking unfortunately and that happened
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
on the right and the left um things that
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
could have been done uh at the state
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
level uh for you know for from a
 
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.150 align:start position:0%
level uh for you know for from a
representative

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
perspective um one of the big pieces I'm
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
going to say it and you all might cringe
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
um the parental Bill of Rights that was
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
brought forward in the last legislative
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
session that was uh shut down at its
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
core when it was initially introduced um
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of it was specific to um obviously
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum and things along those lines
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
but forced mandated vaccinations um that
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
was that was a big thing for a lot of
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
people um so at a legislative level
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that the parents feel
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
confident in sending their child to
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
school we had a child in nasua that was
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for the flu without a consent
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
form things like that um but it was very
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
fear-driven it came from the top and it
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
made its way all the way to the bottom
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
and if you spoke uh in opposition to the
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
mandates or to wanting to reopen the
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
schools um there were labels thrown out
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
and it it was it was scary for a lot of
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
us um other things that legislation
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
might have been able to do at the state
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
level um I don't know if you guys are
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
aware and I might be misspeaking and if
 
00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
I am someone somewhere is going to
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
correct me absolutely I guarantee it um
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
you there are no criminal um there are
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
no criminal consequences throughout the
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for cyber
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
stalking or doxing a uh resident or a
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
citizen that only applies through I
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
believe State uh law and again if I'm
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
wrong um please correct me send me an
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
email um I'm happy to to correct myself
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
um there is no such thing as a
 
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
cyberstalking or doxing law that
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
prevents people from doxing residents it
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
does apply to elected officials but it
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to Citizens so someone
 
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
like myself who speaks out um whose
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
address is shared um who you know uh is
 
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
is cyber stalked by a number of people
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
elected individuals cyberstalking me you
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
try to seek recourse for that to correct
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
those behaviors so that it stops
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
happening and people learn their lesson
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
right as an accountable accountability
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't do things or there are
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
consequences um there were no
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
consequences for a lot of the people
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
that committed these horrible horrible
 
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
things against people like myself who
 
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.349 align:start position:0%
things against people like myself who
spoke

00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
out well I thank you for your candid
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
honesty um in your opinions here today
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
and what you've experienced is just
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
horrific um I think that like you said
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
everyone needs to be
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
open-minded and understand where other
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
people are coming
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
from um because we all come from
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
different places and have different
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
opinions but we really need to learn to
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
listen to each other and it's not an US
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
versus them mentality
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
and I think kindness can go a long way
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
treating everyone with respect no matter
 
00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
where their opinion comes from um I
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
think is something that needs to be
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
restored um here and and we can start
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
hearing this and you know it really
 
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
needs to you know happen um in my
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
personal opinion
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
obviously um but I do really appreciate
 
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
you coming in and telling your story and
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
I am sorry that your children and then
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
all the other children um have these
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
experiences and that have mental health
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
issues now because of it and are behind
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
in educa in their education so um I'm
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%

go and I appreciate you letting me talk
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
I um am leaving on Monday for Europe for
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
seven weeks so I will not be here for
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of this committee unfortunately
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
because I've enjoyed working yes do you
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
need someone to handle a
 
00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.430 align:start position:0%
need someone to handle a
[Laughter]

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
luggage if you can fit in it I'll take
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
you um so I had things that I had wanted
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
to say since I won't be around to say
 
00:44:42.839 --> 00:44:43.790 align:start position:0%
to say since I won't be around to say
them

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
later um and if you'll pardon me I did
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
write it
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
because frantically trying to get
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
everything taken care of before leaving
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
I have not been getting enough sleep and
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
when I don't sleep I lose my
 
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.230 align:start position:0%
when I don't sleep I lose my
words

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
um so what is the scientific method now
 
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
my dad was a physicist my dad had over
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
200 um patents to his name he and his
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
friend Freddy Friedrich developed the
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
quartz hogen lamp which you all I
 
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
presume are familiar with um he
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
developed the lights that are currently
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
lighting the Statue of Liberty he did a
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
lot of very interesting things and he
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
drilled into us as kids logical thinking
 
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
and the scientific method and what he
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
explained to us was when you have an
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
idea Theory
 
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
hypothesis you want to check it
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
out but and it'd be really nice to prove
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
that it's true but that's next to
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
impossible to do so what you do instead
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
false and if you prove that it's false
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
then you look at it and you take your
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
new information and you revamp your
 
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:08.559 align:start position:0%
theory and you go from there and you
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
keep working on it until you end up with
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
the theory that you can't prove is
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
false and why do you want to do that
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
well reality has a way of jumping up and
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
hitting you in the
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
face so if you're following and acting
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
on a theory that's false you're lamp can
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
fail your Bridge can fall your patience
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
can die right so you don't want to be
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
acting on false information or false
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
ideas um and to prove it false all you
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
need is one counter example and then so
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
you know okay it doesn't mean throw out
 
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
the whole thing it means that you got
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
part of it wrong so you you go again you
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
look at it you put your new information
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
in and you keep working on it and when
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
you get to the point where you can't
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
come up with any other
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
rigorous um experiment and by rigorous
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
one thing you need to worry about is
 
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
only one variable at a time right if you
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
have multiple variables how do you know
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
what the answer is one variable at a
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
time he taught us to look very carefully
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
and see how else might this be um what
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
else might be causing this what am I
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
overlooking Etc this is The Way We Were
 
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:29.559 align:start position:0%
brought up as kids I went on to physics
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
and Mathematics my brothers did similar
 
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.150 align:start position:0%
and Mathematics my brothers did similar
such

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
such
 
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.150 align:start position:0%
such
things

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
um if you're in a company you open that
 
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
up to other people in the
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
company and you know you work together
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
you're a team that works problem is if
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
you're in current research in
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
universities and places like
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
that and you don't get it right to begin
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
with somebody proves you wrong instead
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
of the way it used to be where you would
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
get feedback and go again and maybe
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else would then be interested
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
in your idea and following up on it now
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
you tend to get your funding yanked and
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
you get made fun of and you might not
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
get funding again I mean it's a very bad
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
scientific environment that we have at
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
the moment and that's really hard and
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to make science go
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
forward so you have a lot of people
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not I think because they
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
want to but because the incentive system
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
is don't admit you made a mistake don't
 
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
you know hang on to your ideas because
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's the only way you're going to hang
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
on to your funding and keep working and
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
that's a very bad situation to be in
 
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
because reality is reality right
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
is so thinking along those lines we
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
heard an awful lot of it's the science
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
right this is the science or as fouchi
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
would I would say that that is the
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
antithesis of the science because the
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
science is always open it's always
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
looking it's always improving it's
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
always trying to
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
find where am I not right you know we're
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
testing and and and as soon as you stop
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
and say this is it this is the science
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
then when you get new information you're
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
not going to look at it because I am the
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
science and therefore I'm not going to
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
look at somebody you know new
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
information that's coming in and that
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
dangerous

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
um the theory well science has to be
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
nimble open-minded and ready to change
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
in the face of counter
 
00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
examples and it must change in the face
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
of counter examples because somewhere
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
there's a misunderstanding a
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
misconception and if you proceed with
 
00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:05.950 align:start position:0%
misconception and if you proceed with
that

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
misconception bad things will happen now
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
do you have to have it all right before
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
you act on it no because that's part of
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
how you're learning right but you have
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
to keep that open mind you have to keep
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
looking all right so an emergency comes
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
up you act on what you have but you keep
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
taking in new data you keep adjust in
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
your theory you can't stop at any point
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
you can't you have to keep going you
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
have to have an open mind as the person
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
before has kept talking about it's
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
critical especially in an emergency
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
situation where there's so much we don't
 
00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
know you have to keep that open mind the
 
00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.510 align:start position:0%
know you have to keep that open mind the
whole

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
time and when you hear people talking
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
science the science in capital letters
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
you need to start looking at what are
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
they avoid
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
voiding what's in it for them is the
 
00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:03.319 align:start position:0%
decision they're making actually based
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
on science or is it based on politics or
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
money are there counter examples with
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
other scientists that come up with are
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
they looking at them refining their
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
Theory or are they holding on to their
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
Theory without considering they may be
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
an error again why Pride politics power
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
money as Representatives who need to
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
make the best decisions for our
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
constituents it's important to ask these
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
questions it's important to consider
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
conflicting points of view it's
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
important to look for those counter
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
examples it's important to seek out
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
other scientists points of view don't
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
rely on publicized mainstream media to
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
find those scientists do your due
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
diligence throughout the covid response
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
there was a plethora of information out
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
there just as we do with
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
bills if you don't understand the topic
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
seek out the people who do learn from
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
them educate yourself the number of
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
people goodness all through Co who I
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
know I met with and various other people
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
from my committee and other committees
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
met with we had the doctors we had the
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
scientists we had the the guy who came
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
in and spoke in the beginning from
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
industry he came into our committee and
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
spent a good bit of time explaining to
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
us how you mitigate um whatever is going
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
on you know whether it's a biological
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
leak a radioactive leak or whatever he
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
explained how it's done
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's there's a whole lot we
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
can't know everything we can't but if
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
we're faced with something we at least
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
and the other thing to ask when
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's telling you do this or this
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to do or this is what
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
we should do ask what's in it for
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
them and it may be all that's in it for
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
them is what's best for their
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
constituents or for the kids as the
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
person before us but sometimes it's more
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
than that or outside of that and
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes what they're suggesting is
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually counterproductive to what's
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
best for the citizens or what's best for
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
the kids and so by asking that it helps
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
you understand where they're coming from
 
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.549 align:start position:0%
you understand where they're coming from
and

00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
maybe if there's something else that you
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
at we had Frontline doctors who actually
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
dealt with patients sick covid patients
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
and they were reporting things which
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
what worked and what didn't work and
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
what happened to those doctors they were
 
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
denied access to hospitals some of them
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
lost their licenses because what they
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
were saying worked it
 
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
worked but it didn't follow the status
 
00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't we have tried the pro
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
protocols those doctors were finding
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
successful rather than taking away their
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
ability to practice and to help patients
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
we allowed as the previous speaker said
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
way too much of our covid response to
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
become political and there was no reason
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
for it I mean if we have and that's on
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
both sides I'm not pointing fingers at
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
any one party or other it became very
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
political and when you're faced with
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
something when you're trying to solve
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
problems and protect people that's the
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
last thing you want is for politics to
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
it one of the ones that stands out to me
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
as being very
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
political at one point president Trump
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
was fighting covid and he made a comment
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
about hydroxy chloroquin showing some
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
potential and needing to research it
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
further but rather than doing so man and
 
00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
I could not believe the reaction he says
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
this might work you would think this
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
might work means we're were going to
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
look at it no that became like the evil
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
the hydroxy chloroquin you couldn't get
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
it you couldn't use it
 
00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:43.589 align:start position:0%
it you couldn't use it
[Music]

00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
um and we didn't even look to see what
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
other countries were doing because there
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
were countries for which it was a great
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
prophylactic who did not get covid or
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
had very low incidence of Co
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
because they were taking hydroxy
 
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
chloroquin for malaria or for you know
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
various other things we didn't even look
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
at that because it became a
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
political thing when there was no reason
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
for that you know it's a medicine search
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
the medicine just because somebody you
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
don't like said it doesn't mean that
 
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
bad and unfortunately that's what we
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
saw um
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
they even went so far as to do a
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
study who were given hydroxy
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
chloroquin just before they died when
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
they were dying when there was no other
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
hope and then they were given more than
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
what was recorded as the safe dosage
 
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
when it had been studied you know you
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
always say up to this amount and no more
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
they were given more than
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
that and guess what they died but
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
instead of looking at it scientifically
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
and saying well what can we learn from
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
that can we learn what you know is it
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
too late to give it do you have to give
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
it earlier we couldn't even do that
 
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
because we gave more than the
 
00:57:19.029 --> 00:57:19.039 align:start position:0%
recommended dose so they could even have
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
you know the treatment could have worked
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
we have no way of knowing because we
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
gave them a lethal
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
dose you know and even the Lancet which
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
had published that withdrew it because
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
they said it was such a bad study and
 
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
yet we heard about it over and over and
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
over and over and over you know these
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
things go out into the Press somebody
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
misstates something somebody makes
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
something up
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes um and it just has a life of
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
its own and you can show what was wrong
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
with it but that doesn't that doesn't
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
take on the life that the initial
 
00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.270 align:start position:0%
take on the life that the initial
misstatement

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
does if that was really
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
science we would have backed it up we
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
would have said okay it doesn't work at
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
that what if we give it a week earlier
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
you know what if we give what if we work
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
on the proper dosing you would have
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
followed it up instead of just
 
00:58:17.599 --> 00:58:19.150 align:start position:0%
followed it up instead of just
developing

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
developing
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
this faulty study and then that's it we
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
proved you can't use it we proved it's
 
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
no good and end of statement let's go on
 
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.950 align:start position:0%
no good and end of statement let's go on
and

00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
science and then you have to ask
 
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
why now by then they knew they were
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
working on vaccines I mean they started
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
working on vaccines very early on but
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
they also knew if they were going to
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
bring this vaccine out whatever vaccines
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
they brought
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
out it was probably going to have to be
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
under emergency youth Au use
 
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.910 align:start position:0%
under emergency youth Au use
authorization

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
um but to do that you can't have any
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
treatment that
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
works so if you have a treatment that
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
works you can't bring out that
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine so is that why they did it they
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
had to prove there was you know things
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
that looked like they were going to work
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
ior mechon was another one
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
there were countries all over who were
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
using Ivermectin very successfully there
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
were doctors who were using iorc very
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
successfully Frontline
 
00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:39.799 align:start position:0%
doctors some of them lost their licenses
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
for doing so even though it was approved
 
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
for any use right it was determined to
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
be completely safe and doctors had been
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
using it for other
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
uses for a long time now we can't have
 
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:56.950 align:start position:0%
uses for a long time now we can't have
that

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
why was that was that science was that
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
politics was that money was that
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
power we got to look at that why did we
 
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
make those decisions why did we do
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't make any sense I mean in
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
India they couldn't vaccinate everybody
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
they didn't have they didn't have the V
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
you know in the beginning when it came
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
out so they sent these people into the
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
poor to reach places with these Med
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
packs and in them it had things like
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
vitamin C vitamin D Ivor mecon you know
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
some of the things that have been found
 
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:37.990 align:start position:0%
some of the things that have been found
to

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
work and the people who were going in
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
there were taking them they found that
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
those people did not get
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
covid and that was you could look at
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
that as a really big liveaction
 
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
study um because other regions of India
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
were being highly
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
infected but where they used that and
 
01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
that was just supposed to be a stop Gap
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
until they could get the vaccines there
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
but it
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
worked and yet we said you can't do that
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
so why why what is the science and what
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
is the not science what is behind the
 
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
making then there was the question of
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
mass s which was brought up by again our
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
previous speaker prior to June 12th
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
2020 many experts including fouchy and
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
the who spoke about the essential
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
uselessness of maske wearing in relation
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
to a virus like this an Airborne
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
virus according to a report by the BBC's
 
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
Deb Cohen the who changed their experts
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
finding on the essential uselessness of
 
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
masks in June under heavy political
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
politics by March 2022 the vast majority
 
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
of school buildings Nationwide were shut
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
down at their Peak the closures affected
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
at least 55.1 million students in
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
124,000 US public and private schools
 
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
reported education week in order to slow
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
the spread of the Corona virus governors
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
in 48 states either ordered or
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
recommended that schools remain closed
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
through the end of the 2019 2020
 
01:02:40.349 --> 01:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
June parents were quite understanding at
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
this point schools were dealing with
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
high levels of uncertainty danger and
 
01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:50.839 align:start position:0%
frequently shifting expert guidance
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
however they fully expected schools to
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
figure out how to reopen by the Fall
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
and as we heard in one of our first
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
hearings from the industry expert who
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
came to speak to us what they could have
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
done to reopen they got the money they
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
could have used it to put those filters
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
in that kill the virus even this even
 
01:03:16.349 --> 01:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
the schools like Al in my town who are
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
too old we don't have an HVAC
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
system we have radiator units you
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
know we could have put filters in in
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
there we had the money too I mean that
 
01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
came from the federal government so
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
there was no reason following the
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
science for any of the schools to have
 
01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
stayed closed in the fall they had the
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
money they had the time and the knoow
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
there in June Randy wein Garten
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
president of the American Federation of
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
teachers told Fox News that in order to
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
reopen safely schools would need more
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
resources we need the money for PPE we
 
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
Garten said we need the money for extra
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
teachers we need the money for extra
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
cleaning and extra buses the federal
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
government responded with the cares act
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
including $ 13.2 billion in emergency
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
funding for schools across the country
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
to use for their core functions as well
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
as for coordination of preparedness and
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
schools only offered online
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
instruction a national survey conducted
 
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
by Common Sense Media in August found
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
that 59% of teens reported that they
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
believed online learning is worse than
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
in-person learning whereas only 19%
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
reported the opposite some teens being
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
teens disliked remote learning so much
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
that they figured out how to take a
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
screenshot of them elv looking
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
engaged and posting it so they could
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
leave the virtual room and go do what
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
to of the public schools that did reopen
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
for in-person instruction most impose
 
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
Mass mandates and social
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
distancing but many of the schools which
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
at first reopened then closed again
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
parents started showing up at school
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
board meetings demanding that schools
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
reopen one might say that the parents
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
demands were
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
unreasonable except private schools were
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
reopening safely more than eight out of
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
10 private schools associated with the
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
National Association of Independent
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
Schools reopened in the fall of 2020
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
with full or partial imperson
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
instruction nationally by mid October
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
about 60% of individual private schools
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
were fully in person while just 5% were
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
just were remote only meanwhile more
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
than nine out of 10 Catholic schools
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
schools reopened for in-person
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
instruction and I'm not sure exactly
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
what the percentage was in New Hampshire
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
but what I do know that it didn't take
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
long for every single private school in
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
the state to be
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
full because the parents whose schools
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
were not open they just took their kids
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
and enrolled them in private schools or
 
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
whatever um and there was not a place
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
for a single other
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
child um a number of the schools were
 
01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:28.119 align:start position:0%
doing what they could to expand to take
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
in these extra kids so again I have to
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
ask is that science or is that politics
 
01:06:38.589 --> 01:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
or what is that that public schools
 
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
aren't open and private schools are and
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
private schools we didn't hear about any
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
great epidemics of covid there was no
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
higher incidents than there was in the
 
01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:52.230 align:start position:0%
higher incidents than there was in the
general

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
public the long-term closing of schools
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
and the harm to Children academically
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
socially and emotionally was a decision
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
based not on health but I would say on
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
politics thanks to teachers
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
unions Stanford University did a study
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
which found that public schools in areas
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
with stronger teachers unions were
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
substantially less likely to reopen in
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%

01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
memberships union membership ship were
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
25% less likely to plan to reopen with
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%

01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%

01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
remains substantively and statistically
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%

commissioner of Education was working
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
diligently to help schools reopen you
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
remember when he came and talked to us
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
and he gave us that whole outline of all
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
the the notices sent out from them and
 
01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
and any school you know they were happy
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
to go and help them
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
reopen but all too many refused used to
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
do so we were told that they were just
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
following the science but to understand
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
why the schools really closed down we
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
need to follow the political science
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
unions represent the interests of their
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
members that means the teachers unions
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
represent the teachers not the students
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
or their families it was in the interest
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
of students and it was in the interest
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
of students and their families for
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
schools to reopen but the unions
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
believed it was in the interests of
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
their members to keep schools closed and
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
to use the prospect of reopening as a
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
bargaining chip under the pretext of
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
safety to extract concessions that were
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
entirely unrelated to covid
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
safety on July 24th 2020 Randy we Garten
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
declared let's stop the debate about
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
whether safety matters and start rolling
 
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
up our sleeves so we can get the
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
resources to meet the needs of the
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
students whether we're teaching remotely
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
or in person unions declared that they
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't reopen because the federal
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
government must provide schools with the
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
resources we need to reopen in a
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable manner it soon became clear
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
that the money in politics not science
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
not sure what that had to do with
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
science or reopening schools safely but
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
this was going on across our country and
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
it did affect the teachers unions in New
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they might not have been
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
petitioning but they were listening
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
more and more research is showing that
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
reopening schools were not overly

October 2020 schools are not super
 
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:14.679 align:start position:0%

01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
low even in places with high Community
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
rates meanwhile it was already becoming
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
clear that learning loss was happening
 
01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
and this is in October
 
01:11:25.719 --> 01:11:30.950 align:start position:0%
and this is in October

2020 in December 2020 a McKenzie report
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
warned of the high cost of this
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
prolonged period of remote learning from
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
rising rates of depression and anxiety
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
to the loss of student learning the
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
research showed that the cumulative
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
learning loss could be substantial
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
especially in mathematics with students
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
on average likely to lose 5 to n months
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
of learning by the end of this school
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
year that would be June of
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
21 in spite of this evident learning
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
loss and parental pressure on public
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
officials to reopen schools unions did
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
everything possible to keep schools
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
closed despite all the evidence that
 
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
opening schools was safe unions held
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
protests against reopening they
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
displayed mock gravestones makeshift
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
coffins and their own early obituaries
 
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
others used faked body bags signs with
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
things such as I can't teach from the
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
grave yeah two weeks to slow the spread
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
generation the unions also work behind
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
the scenes to influence the federal
 
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
agencies that school districts relied
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
upon to interpret the science regarding
 
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
covid in early 2021 the CDC was about to
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
issue new guidance for
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
reopening doc doents obtained via foyer
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
request by Americans for public trust
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
revealed that the major teachers unions
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
heavily Lobby the CDC to influence that
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
guidance emails acquire
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
requ acquired by the New York Post
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
revealed that CDC reopening guidance
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
used the language suggested to them by
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
Randy weart aft and in some cases
 
01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
practically word for
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
word on the same day that the CDC
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
released its reopening guidelines the
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
AFT issued a press release praising the
 
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
CDC for producing a rigorous road map
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
based on science that our members can
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
use to fight for a safe reopening they
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
praise the guidelines for including
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
compulsory masking six feet of physical
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
distancing handwashing cleaning and
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
ventilation diagnostic testing and
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
contact tracing as well as vaccine
 
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
priority for teachers and School staff
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
in addition the AFT thanked the Biden
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
Administration for its $ 1.9 trillion
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
American Rescue plan and for creating a
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
culture of trust and collaboration with
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
the union and I did not write down but a
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
later amount was more money that would
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
then was spent on completely rebuilding
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
the um country's re rebuilt after the
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
war after World War II it was a huge
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
amount of money that was given to the
 
01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.709 align:start position:0%
amount of money that was given to the
schools

01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
so that all sounds good right what's
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
wrong with that except we know that the
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
science had already shown that maths
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
don't work for airborne viruses partly
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
as was explained to us but partly as was
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know at from the industry experts
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
but partly as was explained to us by Dr
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
fouchy and the who in the very
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
beginning so it's not like oh we just
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
made that up and if you want to look at
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
who might know whether or not it works
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
look on the sides of the boxes it says
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
do not use for children under 12 years
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
of age it says does not work to prevent
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
covid transmission does not work to
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
prevent catching covid it says right on
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
the box with the masks so you know
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there is the science and
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there is something that's
 
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
not science and if the very people who
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
are developing and making the MTH say
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
this doesn't work for what you're
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
wanting to use it for I would hope those
 
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
them and in addition we now know from a
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
study done by environmental and water
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
chemistry for human health group that
 
01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
masks not only don't stop covid but they
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
may release up to
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
5,390 microplastic particles in a
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
24-hour period and surgical mask in
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
particular May release approximately
 
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
3,152 microfibers in less than one
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
pasas so we have made people for one to
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
two years wear these
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
masks that have higher levels of pest
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
than we've been trying to outlaw in the
 
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
addition talk about science the six-
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
foot distancing was made up by a school
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
girl for her science fair
 
01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
project that's where that came from but
 
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
her dad was a
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
modeler and her dad took that and back
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
when Bush was trying to come up with
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
what are our national emergency
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
plans um the guy presented it and the
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
immunologists and the doctors were there
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
who said that's not going to work but
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
she said masking in six foot distance
 
01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
that was her theory for a science fair
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
project her dad you know took it the
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
experts all said you're crazy that's not
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
going to work why are you even listening
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
to that but the dad what I say was a
 
01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
modeler he had snazzy presentations and
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
the government took it and listened to
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
him instead of the experts so there's
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
science for
 
01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
science for
you

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:29.370 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:31.310 align:start position:0%
you
[Music]

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.790 align:start position:0%
[Music]
not

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
and contract tasing one of the other
 
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
things that was used to shut down whole
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
classrooms at a time for like two weeks
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
at a time so one kid had been in contact
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
with somebody someplace who might have
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
had covid and now his whole classroom
 
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
and anybody he's been in contact with
 
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
weeks and what was the CDC planning on
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
saying before the teachers unions got
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
hold of
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
instruction that was their plan that was
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
what they were going to
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
say in a text message exchange later
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
revealed by a foyer request by the fair
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
a county parents Association weine
 
01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
Garten raised concerns about this
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
language with the CDC director wilinsky
 
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
the cdc's final language was
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
significantly wimped changing the word
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
can to have options to so that the
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines read all schools have the
 
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
option to provide in-person
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
instruction which is not the same as all
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
schools can do
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
this other important guidance was also
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
arranged to be altered by the AF there's
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
a whole list of them you can go and read
 
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
it so the guidance which wrought such
 
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
Havoc with our children's
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
education ultimately setting them back
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
at least two years rather than being
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
based on science was based on Union
 
01:19:14.679 --> 01:19:16.390 align:start position:0%
based on science was based on Union
political

01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
political
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
machinations the very unions dealing
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
with teaching and education were
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the anti-education which
 
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
took took place once again politics
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
science and you say 2 years well you
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
know in two years they'll make up for it
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
no problem except that people's brains
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
develop in a sort of a logical
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
chronological order and at various times
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
they're more or less receptive to
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
learning certain
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
things and so yeah you miss a week you
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
miss a month but you missed two years
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
you may well have missed that
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
whole time period where the brain is
 
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
ready to receive certain things all
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
those kids who had trouble
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
speaking they're learning how to talk
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're learning what it's all about now
 
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
you have a askk and you can't hear and
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
you can't see what anybody's doing with
 
01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
going Earth how are you supposed to know
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
how to make those words how are you even
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to hear what those words
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
are we had a bill on something
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
completely different but having to do
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
education and somebody from the special
 
01:20:42.189 --> 01:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
um administrators organization was in
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
talking to us and she was talking about
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
how they couldn't
 
01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.870 align:start position:0%
how they couldn't
get

01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.830 align:start position:0%
get
um

01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient people to come into all the
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
schools to teach what the kids needed
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
and somebody might have even been a rep
 
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
beler over there asked why are there so
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
many you know why is there such a
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
greater need than normal and her
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
covid I'm hoping she'll come and and be
 
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
able to talk to you in sometime in the
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
next few weeks because I went and talked
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
to her afterwards and I said Co why Co
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
and she said well math and school
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
closures the number of speech therapists
 
01:21:33.629 --> 01:21:33.639 align:start position:0%
that are needed now to try to teach
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
those kids how to talk who spent two
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
years with masks and everybody around
 
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
them wearing
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
masks we don't have that many speech
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
therapists in the State trying to get
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
the services for these
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
kids they're not able to do
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
that um and the and the school closures
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
she said kids sat and watch The Boob
 
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
Tube you know for all that time you know
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
they they weren't
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
learning and as you saw what the some of
 
01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
the teenagers were doing they weren't
 
01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
even present they were doing whatever
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
they wanted to
 
01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:14.550 align:start position:0%
they wanted to
do

01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
um along with the anxiety the mental
 
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
difficulties Etc from having gone
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
through that it's it's rough and so I'm
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
hoping she said she would put together
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
talk to all the other um administrators
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
in the state and in her or in you know
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
in her organization and hopefully she'll
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
be able to come and tell you cuz she
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
said yes she has lots of data and she
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
will be happy to share the
 
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
Co I didn't want to quite go to the
 
01:22:55.199 --> 01:22:56.550 align:start position:0%
Co I didn't want to quite go to the
vaccines

01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
yet I wanted
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
to comment about the masks because the
 
01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
divisive um my daughter-in-law's dad was
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
sick he was slowly
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
dying so everybody had to have masks her
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
kids who lived in the same
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
place could not see their grandparents
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
because if they didn't didn't wear their
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
mask they might kill their grandparents
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
if they touch the grandparents they
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
might kill their grandparents what a
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
horrible thing to do to a
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
kid they came to see me
 
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
outside 6 feet wasn't enough 16 feet
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
they had to stay away they didn't
 
01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
understand why they couldn't come and
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
give me a
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
hug I was fine with it but I couldn't
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
wear a mask because I had um really bad
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
asthma at the time and putting the mask
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
on dropped my O2 noticeably anytime I go
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
to the doctor's office of course you
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
have to wear the mask and they take the
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
O2 and they'd look startled and
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
concerned and they'd say drop your mask
 
01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
and I drop my mask and then they'd sigh
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
relief because my O2 would pop up okay
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's just the mask and I'd have to put
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
it back on again well I'm not running
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
around wearing a mask that's keeping my
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
O2 long enough that my nurse is
 
01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.590 align:start position:0%
O2 long enough that my nurse is
concerned

01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know that was the last I ever saw my
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
grandkids cuz I didn't wear a
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
mask cuz it
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't it was a long time ago I used
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
to come all the
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
time I'm not unique I hear this story
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
over and over and
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
over families who never see each other
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
friends who never see each
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
other for something that didn't even
 
01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.470 align:start position:0%
other for something that didn't even
work

01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
that we knew didn't even work and we
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
again this brings us to the
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines we've learned through the
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
testimony of Aaron Siri how science was
 
01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.430 align:start position:0%
testimony of Aaron Siri how science was
totally

01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
totally
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
ignored all of his evidence came from
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccine manufacturers and the FDA
 
01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.189 align:start position:0%
the vaccine manufacturers and the FDA
and

01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
CDC through what they had published on
 
01:25:30.189 --> 01:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
their own and that which was acquired
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
through foyer
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
requests I'm not going to go over these
 
01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
we had seven hours and an extra two
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
hours while they presented all of
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
that but I just want to remind
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
us that many signals were apparent long
 
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
before the testing was finished and
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
according to precedent and law the test
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
should have been stopped and the vaccine
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
declared unsafe at that
 
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
point instead in the middle of the tests
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
the experiments they change the
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
definitions and testing
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
criteria how scientific is that oh we're
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
getting signals that says this is not
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
safe this is dangerous in fact well
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
let's just change our criteria so it
 
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
where is that considered Prof proper
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
where is that considered proper
 
01:26:34.199 --> 01:26:35.510 align:start position:0%
where is that considered proper
scientific

01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
methodology besides failing their own
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
tests which the FDA knew but okay the
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
vaccines anyway they totally redefine
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
them a true vaccine is understood to
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
keep the vaccinated individual from
 
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
getting the disease as well as stopping
 
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
the transmission of the disease that's
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
how vaccine was
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
always um defined but they had to change
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
that because they realized these
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines didn't do
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
that people still get vaccinated and
 
01:27:09.629 --> 01:27:09.639 align:start position:0%
still get covid people still get
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and spread
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
covid so the whole idea of having
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates mandating that somebody
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
take something into their body which
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
they don't want or don't consider to be
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
them because somehow that's going to
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
stop covid except we know it wasn't
 
01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
going to so why again where's the
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
science and what were those decisions
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
on only the drug companies in their
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
early public reports admitted they
 
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to be the case and in fact
 
01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
they had too little information to
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
determine its effic
 
01:27:58.030 --> 01:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
and yet we were repeatedly told that the
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine was safe and
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
effective we we are not clear of blame
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
here five minutes of research would have
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
given us that some people did that five
 
01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
minutes of research and they put it out
 
01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
because it was in the original posts
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
posted by those vaccine companies and
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
yet we allowed those mandates to take
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
knowing or could have been knowing if we
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
had bo even bothered to
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
look that the manand that the vaccines
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
weren't going to do what we were
 
01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
expecting them to do and so there was no
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
reason to mandate them it should have
 
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
been an individual decision because we
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
anybody if we were truly interested in
 
01:28:55.149 --> 01:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
science rather than politics and money
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
we would have not mandated vaccines for
 
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
anyone especially children and pregnant
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
women you don't take chances or normally
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
you don't take chances with children and
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
pregnant women those are like hands
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
did in fact a study was done to
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
determine if the vaccine was safe for
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
pregnant women in their first
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
trimester the results looked very bad
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
bad the incidence of miscarriage after
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
the shot was given was many times higher
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
than normal I tried to go back and look
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
up those numbers I read that study at
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
the time it was huge but of course it
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
disappeared as so much
 
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
information at the time so many studies
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
disappeared well that one was
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
disappeared as
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
well well they couldn't bring out that
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
and say oh it's really not safe you're
 
01:29:56.109 --> 01:29:56.119 align:start position:0%
way more likely to have a miscarriage so
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
what did they do they added a huge
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
number of third trimester pregnant
 
01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
women to bring down that number so they
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
could say only the incidence is only a
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
little higher and there was a little
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
asterisk on the study that said that's
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
what they did in tiny print you had to
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
read it but it was
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
there it's not how you do a study that's
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.550 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
publicly then they publicly stated that
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
the vaccines were safe and effective
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
even for pregnant women in their first
 
01:30:38.109 --> 01:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
trimester even though they knew that
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't true even though their studies
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
showed what a huge increase it was for
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.149 --> 01:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
miscarriages how many babies died
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
because we followed the politics and
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
money rather than the
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
science how many moms are dealing with
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
guilt of having listened to the lies and
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
having killed their much desired
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
babies I personally know of one a nurse
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
at conquered hospital she and her
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
husband desperately wanted a child but
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
she was a healthc care worker and was
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
thus mandated to get the
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
shot remember when we passed that bill
 
01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
that said that if you take State money
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
you can't mandate the
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
workers since she was in her first
 
01:31:39.629 --> 01:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
trimester she asked her doctor if it
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
would be safe he regurgitated the S
 
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
standard the vaccines are safe and
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
effective and that she should get this
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
shot to prevent the baby from getting
 
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
sick in case she were to catch
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
thereafter but we now know even if she
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
had successfully delivered the baby
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
because she'd been vaccinated her milk
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
would cause the bifid of bacteria in her
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
baby's gut to die
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
off bifido bacteria is an important part
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
of our immune system newborns are
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to have a ton of bifido
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
bacteria 90% of the microbiome of babies
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
if bifido
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
bacteria one of the common findings in
 
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
autistic children is the loss of bifido
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
bacteria how many sickly or autistic
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
children will we now have because we
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
followed the politics and money rather
 
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
science I went and talked with
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
those healthcare
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
workers who were protesting outside of
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
conquered hospital because in not too
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
many weeks that in they were going to
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
have to be vaccinated or lose their jobs
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
about 20% of the workers at conser
 
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
hospital and I asked them now let me let
 
01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
me get this straight you guys worked
 
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
through covid you didn't mind coming in
 
01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
every day risking getting covid and a
 
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
number of them said and we
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
did and doing your job in that horrible
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
time and
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
now you just have to get a vaccine or
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
you lose your your job and you're not
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
willing to get the vaccine you were
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
willing to work during covid but you're
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
not willing to work you're not willing
 
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
to get the vaccine you're willing to
 
01:33:43.629 --> 01:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
lose your job what have you
 
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
seen why did you make that
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
started the woman who got her vaccine
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
and her body became quickly filled with
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
blood clots she was out of work for a
 
01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.550 align:start position:0%
blood clots she was out of work for a
long

01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
time the woman whose doctor when she had
 
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
gone to get her flu vaccine the year
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
before she had had a mild reaction and
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
the doctor had
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
said you should probably never get any
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
other vaccines because I think you've
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
become allergic to them and it could be
 
01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.910 align:start position:0%
become allergic to them and it could be
very

01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous but she had children
 
01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
and no
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
husband and she needed to support those
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
children and she went to her doctor well
 
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
what do you think well you know you
 
01:34:37.229 --> 01:34:37.239 align:start position:0%
could have a serious allergic reaction
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
well can you write me a medical
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
exemption no I can't do that because if
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
I did that I would lose my
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
job so she got vaccinated because she
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want to lose her job because she
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
didn't know how she was going to support
 
01:34:51.119 --> 01:34:52.149 align:start position:0%
didn't know how she was going to support
her

01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
kids she was within 7 Seconds of being
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
brain dead before they managed to get
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
tracheotomy and the list went
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
on and that's why they weren't willing
 
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
to take those risks nor should they have
 
01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:13.629 align:start position:0%
to take those risks nor should they have
had

01:35:13.629 --> 01:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
to and I remember how ugly it was then I
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
remember some woman a nurse three young
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
and she Saidi don't believe in this I
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to do this Etc and they said
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
all right you don't do it you're
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
fired and she got the vaccine and I
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
remember people on the Press were
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
crowing about it and laughing she had no
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
principles she just needed to be
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
bought no she needed to take care of her
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
children she had principles that
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately she had to give up in
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
order to to make sure her children could
 
01:35:57.390 --> 01:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
eat and had a place to live and yet
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
her I don't want to live through that
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
again I can remember sitting at an ice
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
cream stand with my friend and her kids
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
we'd gone camping we stopped for ice
 
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
cream we're sitting at the picnic table
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about some of the
 
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
things that we'd recently learned
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
studies that we'd recently read lady in
 
01:36:25.229 --> 01:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
the other table oh this is terrible and
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
she comes over and starts chastising us
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
and berating us and we should get
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and you know that's all
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
balone and we're not scientists how can
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
we study that how can we possibly
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
understand that she's a scientist well
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
coming to find out she had fewer
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications than either one of us did
 
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
to understand what those studies were
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
she knew nothing she didn't know who we
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
were she just came and started Bering us
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
for not getting vaccinated and finally I
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
looked at her and I said lady you know
 
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
nothing about me if I took that vaccine
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
I'd be dead most
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
likely I have so many um autoimmune
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
issues that is there there's no way I
 
01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
should take that vaccine but you didn't
 
01:37:14.109 --> 01:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
know that she kind of vaguely apologized
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
vaguely but then made sure to shake her
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
finger at us and still tell us we
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't talk about those
 
01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
things that's the society we were living
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
ugly we couldn't know about the lack of
 
01:37:40.990 --> 01:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the vaccine nor the dangers
 
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
associated with it that's not that we
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
really couldn't but they were going to
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
make sure we
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't the government had social media
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
platforms censor the information
 
01:37:52.679 --> 01:37:54.109 align:start position:0%
platforms censor the information
available

01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
I had many entries on Facebook censored
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
for supposed
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
misinformation I would post actual
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
studies not commentaries made by
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
reputable and well-regarded hospitals
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
and they would be declared
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
misinformation and people couldn't read
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
them they'd be blanked out with that
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
misinformation across them I remember
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
one of them early on was doctors working
 
01:38:20.589 --> 01:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
at the hospital and they said you know
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
we're killing people
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
because their lungs aren't filled with
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
liquid we're treating them as if their
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
lungs are filled with liquid what we're
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
finding is their lungs are filled with
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
blood clots and when we
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
use the ventilators we're actually
 
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
blowing out their
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
lungs and at the same time there was a
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
video by a nurse who was in tears
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
because she was trying to treat these
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
people and she was watching them be
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
killed before her eyes by doctors who
 
01:38:58.510 --> 01:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
were blowing out their lungs now she
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
assumed they were just using too high of
 
01:39:03.589 --> 01:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
pressure but if that study could have
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
been not misinformation maybe people
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
could have read that and said oh this is
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate treatment and maybe a lot
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
of people's lives would have been saved
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
but no we couldn't have that
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
misinformation so they kept blowing out
 
01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:19.310 align:start position:0%
misinformation so they kept blowing out
people's

01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
people's
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
and the number of times I look back at
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
those studies later well I can't see
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
them but I remember what they were and I
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
I can go back to the Facebook page and I
 
01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
can comment huh funny how this is now
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
accepted as TR you know fact but it was
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
misinformation at the time even though
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
it was a real scientific study with real
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
facts that's can't be misinformation
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
conclusions but what they saw is what
 
01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
they saw right the test results are the
 
01:40:11.599 --> 01:40:15.550 align:start position:0%
they saw right the test results are the
test

01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
results but the government went to some
 
01:40:19.589 --> 01:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
lengths to make sure we didn't know the
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
truth when too many people who had been
 
01:40:25.149 --> 01:40:25.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinated began to get covid they
 
01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
changed their testing
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
protocols initially they had set the
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
cycle thresholds to 40 CT even though
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
there was an apparent scientific
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
consensus regarding the
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
unreliability in favor of false
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
positives of all PCR tests operated
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
Beyond 30 to 33
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
CT but when they noticed too many
 
01:40:48.990 --> 01:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated getting covid they adjusted
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
it to 28 CT for the purposes of
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
calculating the number of cases suddenly
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
appearing in the cohort of the
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinated at the end of 2021 our
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
was strongly advertising that the vast
 
01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:07.719 align:start position:0%
majority of people coming down with
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
covid were the
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated only I happen to have a
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
large straddle pulmonary embolism at
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
about that time and I was in the
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
hospital three three different nurses
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
three different departments three
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
different floors of the hospital when
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
they found out that I was um State Rep
 
01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
they made sure to tell me that most of
 
01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
the people that they were seeing with
 
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinated not the
 
01:41:44.109 --> 01:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated in spite of what our
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
was advertising and you could see them
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
on all the TVs and the banners flowing
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
across Etc
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned that to another rep and
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
she called the department and said so I
 
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
see you're advertising that the
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
um that the majority of people who are
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
getting covid right now are the
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated oh yeah can you give me the
 
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
numbers uh well we have no way of
 
01:42:20.109 --> 01:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
tracking that we really
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
can't figure you know well how can you
 
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:25.639 align:start position:0%
say that the majority of people is one
 
01:42:30.669 --> 01:42:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
it I would love to ask the department
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
that so my question is what was in it
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
what was in it for him to completely
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
make up the
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
science that most of the people were
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated when he couldn't even you
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
know he couldn't track those numbers at
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
why we keep learning more and more
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
things about what was known and what was
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
not known both from whistleblowers and
 
01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.790 align:start position:0%
not known both from whistleblowers and
foyer

01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
foyer
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
requests why did people ignore science
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
at the expense of people's lives and
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
livelihoods I believe that is a question
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
we need to answer if we're going to not
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
make the same mistakes
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
again we need to learn to look past the
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
politics the money the power to see the
 
01:43:37.709 --> 01:43:37.719 align:start position:0%
beauty of the truth we need to school
 
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves in looking at multiple points
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
of view in realizing that there if there
 
01:43:44.669 --> 01:43:44.679 align:start position:0%
are multiple path multiple points of
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
view then perhaps our idea Theory
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
we need open Pathways of communication
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
which allow us to gather as much diverse
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
information and points of view as
 
01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
possible we need to be open to these
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
contrary ideas regardless of which party
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
they come from no one has a monopoly on
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
science we need to be sure to follow
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
money so I'm open for questions or
 
01:44:22.719 --> 01:44:25.669 align:start position:0%
money so I'm open for questions or
comments

01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.679 --> 01:44:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair and also
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
represent leas first and foremost I hope
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
you have a wonderful time in yor thank
 
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
you so much seven weeks sounds a great
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
time to get out of here um also my
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
condolences to you and your
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
grandchildren um that's a very sad story
 
01:44:50.430 --> 01:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
to hear um I've also heard from other
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
grandparents having something comparable
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
to it it
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
it tore P families apart politically um
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
so I reach out to you with a lot of
 
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
empathy thank you very much I think you
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
testimony speaks to what I consider to
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
be the three PS you throw fourth one
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
there as well um it comes down to his
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
profits power and
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
politics and fundamentally where science
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
lies in that I'm not sure but also the
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
fourth p is paranoia there's a
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of fear of the unknown
 
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
and I I think you're hitting upon the
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
issue of how do we deal with the
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
psychology not so much the science but
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
the science of people psychology of
 
01:45:34.109 --> 01:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
people how they respond to the unknown
 
01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
and the fear is something maybe we
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
should be thinking about embedding into
 
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
anything going forward both at the state
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
and National level but I think
 
01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
fundamentally when you get in we as a
 
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
person as a society get into something
 
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
we don't understand fear takes over and
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
when fear takes over not just politics
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's the issue of how do we deal and how
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
do we help people get through that fear
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you for Testimony this morning
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's insightful and hope you
 
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
have a wonderful time in your thank you
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
and to follow up on what you just
 
01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.950 align:start position:0%
and to follow up on what you just
said

01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
um we should look at what we did to
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
expand fear and what we could do to
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
decrease fear because certainly telling
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
kids that if they didn't wear masks
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
they'd kill their grandparents parents I
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
think that kind of expanded fear and not
 
01:46:28.589 --> 01:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
decreased it and that is something that
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
was being said to young children which
 
01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
is unfortunate but yeah and we talked a
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about that in our very first
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
or second
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
meeting with um Homeland Security PE you
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
know is how how could we have addressed
 
01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
the situation to begin with and how in
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
the future when we have unknown how can
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
we address the situation I think that's
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
a great thing to look
 
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
at I concur I would say unfortunately we
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
got into the political part of it which
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
only drove the fear right it became
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
divisive and unfortunately we didn't
 
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
find ways to reach across the aisle
 
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
collectively and talk about how we can
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
help people address the fear issue and
 
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
build some trust within the institutions
 
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
for them to rely upon instead we didn't
 
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
do that as a society both at the state
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely represent vble yeah I just
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
want to Echo what uh representative uh
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant said I had a situation where my
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
mother was in a nursing home and I you
 
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
know I couldn't see her for I don't even
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
you she was
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
95 it was it was a anyway it was very
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
difficult time so I would say um
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about is the point
 
01:47:58.990 --> 01:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
of this committee I think that our
 
01:48:01.629 --> 01:48:01.639 align:start position:0%
country and the world was Ill prepared
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
to deal with a pandemic and I'm really
 
01:48:07.589 --> 01:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
hoping that by looking at how we reacted
 
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
to it we're going to do a lot better
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
next time and I think that the lack of
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
preparedness and the lack of knowledge
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
scrambling um created a vacuum where
 
01:48:26.189 --> 01:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
fear and politics could pour in and and
 
01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
you know we just didn't have the
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
resources and the Kno how to react
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
properly I mean I'm I really I'm I'm
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
glad for instance that the governor had
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
this after Action Report done because
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
they pointed out things and we should be
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
able to do better next time and and I
 
01:48:51.149 --> 01:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
think truly understand that pandemics
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
like this can happen
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
like in a matter of a week or two I mean
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
it spreads like crazy and maybe do
 
01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
less panicky
 
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
you I would like to thank you
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
um for being here and telling your story
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
and how difficult uh life got for
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
you um I know many people that have got
 
01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
said I hear the stories with the
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
mandates with vaccines I hear the
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
stories with kids being
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
injected with a with something without
 
01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:47.189 align:start position:0%
injected with a with something without
parental

01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
parental
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
consent and yet there's no recourse for
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
those parents and
 
01:49:58.350 --> 01:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
done I think my personal opinion is that
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
we need to put something in place to
 
01:50:08.669 --> 01:50:08.679 align:start position:0%
penalize those people that are not doing
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
their due diligence and listening to
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
parents and understanding that just
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
because they think and
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
they're they're based on whatever
 
01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
they're hearing they want every one to
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
be injected with a vaccine or a flu that
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
there has to be consequences for their
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
actions because if we don't have
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
consequences for our
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
listen and we see the consequences of
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
what happened with the fear in this
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
country and with people I know I had
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
someone come up and scream scream at me
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
in my
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
face and I was following the social
 
01:51:02.669 --> 01:51:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
we no matter what it is that comes down
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
the pike and I think you pointed out
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
represent Merchant represent evil
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
discuss it is that we need to be
 
01:51:28.069 --> 01:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
open-minded and we need to react in a
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
positive and not a negative thing we
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony here from one of the
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
Commissioners said that one of the
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
things that they did is they set a
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
course and they didn't vear from
 
01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
it which means that was it no matter
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
what happened they were staying on
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
track and to
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
me when new information comes in you
 
01:51:55.149 --> 01:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
me data is changing all the time and the
 
01:52:13.149 --> 01:52:13.159 align:start position:0%
fact that people are posting
 
01:52:16.350 --> 01:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
things that went against the narrative
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to just say this as a
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
narrative um from what was popular
 
01:52:27.629 --> 01:52:27.639 align:start position:0%
because that they it was taken down and
 
01:52:27.639 --> 01:52:29.550 align:start position:0%
because that they it was taken down and
considered

01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
disinformation if we can bring all
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
people to the table even those you
 
01:52:35.159 --> 01:52:37.470 align:start position:0%
people to the table even those you
disagree

01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
with I
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
find that through opposing views you get
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
to the the actual the
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
truth because nobody is right all the
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
time and if we bring we all are looking
 
01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
through a lens of bias and if we take
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
that and get down to the root and we can
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
all understand where everyone's coming
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
from and then why this person is saying
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
that this is working why this person is
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
saying that is
 
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.069 --> 01:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.079 --> 01:53:19.709 align:start position:0%
 
done

01:53:19.709 --> 01:53:19.719 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
and I truly believe that the people that
 
01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
suffered most under this pandemic are
 
01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:29.270 align:start position:0%
suffered most under this pandemic are
the

01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
children the mental health issues we're
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
going to see for decades to
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
Untold because we put such fear in them
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
and those young minds cannot process
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
it I see adults still today fearful
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
themselves it is amazing what leaders
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
people and I think we need to learn that
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
leaders in in our state and anywhere no
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
matter where you are whether it's the
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
teachers or you know the
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
CEO we have responsibilities to
 
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
encourage people to be the best of
 
01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
themselves and how do we
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
diminish instilling fear in
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
function and I think this is where the
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
psychology of all of this comes into and
 
01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
we have to be able to
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
discern the money
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.239 --> 01:54:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
politics

01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
politics
 
01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
and we like I said we all come from
 
01:55:05.709 --> 01:55:05.719 align:start position:0%
different biases but it is our children
 
01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:07.639 align:start position:0%
that has suffered the most I was just at
 
01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
a conference and one of the topics that
 
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
was brought up um the gentleman it was
 
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
in looking at lenses and saying you're
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
going to have to convince me uh that I
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
need to take the covid vaccine
 
01:55:26.069 --> 01:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
you should have heard the room they were
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
like you're going to bring up that topic
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
and so we had to get into groups and how
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
to convince this person why they should
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
take the
 
01:55:40.750 --> 01:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine it was very difficult for a lot
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
of people to be having that
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
discussion but they couldn't get past
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
the narrative that we've been told at
 
01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:50.830 align:start position:0%
the narrative that we've been told at
the

01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
top some people said understood because
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
they had someone that passed away other
 
01:56:01.149 --> 01:56:01.159 align:start position:0%
people had you know we all come from
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
different lenses but to say something is
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
safe and effective when other people
 
01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
have experienced deaths because of that
 
01:56:11.069 --> 01:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
or the
 
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
miscarriages or the health issues that
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
over and I really thank you for bringing
 
01:56:26.669 --> 01:56:26.679 align:start position:0%
all of that up in your in your testimony
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
today and I think it's important that
 
01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
this committee really look at how we can
 
01:56:34.589 --> 01:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
respond and I think the honorable Betty
 
01:56:36.910 --> 01:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
gay when she was here had some really
 
01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
good insight into collaborating with all
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
different people going forward to come
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
together and I really think that as a
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
state we did we did well but I think we
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
can do better
 
01:56:59.790 --> 01:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:12.069 --> 01:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
vacation um not seeing anyone else in
 
01:57:15.310 --> 01:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
the room um I guess I'm going to put
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
this question to the group um we can
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
call it a
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
day okay so I think we'll call it a day
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
today I think at some point we should
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
come back to discuss the uh Homeland
 
01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.709 align:start position:0%
come back to discuss the uh Homeland
Security

01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
Security
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
report um represent
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
beler thank you I I just wanted to speak
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
on that real quick because I'm aware
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
that it was already um read into the
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
record earlier this um uh report the
 
01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
after Action Report however there's a
 
01:57:47.470 --> 01:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
provision early in this report and I I
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
saw as browsing through that I think
 
01:57:53.229 --> 01:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to uh get some um
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
advice and Counsel on to figure this out
 
01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
because despite the fact that I've been
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
I've I've already pred this whole report
 
01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
and it seems perfectly fine to me that
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
it should be public knowledge however
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
there is a tight there's a beginning
 
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
here this this is actually a classified
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
report and this is not for public
 
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
disclosure and internal use only and
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
there appears to be penalties attached
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell within the law that
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
I've just looked up for this so I I
 
01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
think we need to get a little bit of uh
 
01:58:25.629 --> 01:58:25.639 align:start position:0%
guidance on why and whether this is
 
01:58:27.790 --> 01:58:27.800 align:start position:0%
something that we need a non-public
 
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
session a public session I'd certainly
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
like to discuss it publicly because
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's certainly things in here that I
 
01:58:37.149 --> 01:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
think could be useful um but there it
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
is thank you for bringing that to our
 
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
attention and representative
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
evil I did share it with you but it was
 
01:58:49.709 --> 01:58:49.719 align:start position:0%
associated with a a press release by the
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
governor um so they
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with you that was a I
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
mean I read that first thing and I'm
 
01:58:58.830 --> 01:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
like I don't I don't understand what's
 
01:59:01.950 --> 01:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
going on here but um I just wanted to
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
say that it come it did come through the
 
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
governor's office so apparently at least
 
01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
they made some kind of the determination
 
01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
that it was um that it was public
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's um I mean since I had obtained
 
01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
it originally there's a contact name
 
01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
there and if some I don't mind giving
 
01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
that person in a call and just making
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
sure what the uh circumstances are if
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
the committee would like me to do that I
 
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
okay so yes and and they told us that it
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
was going to be available to us when
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
they came in here so it wasn't like this
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
is a big surprise to anyone that is
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
watching so um I I read sorry I read
 
01:59:50.109 --> 01:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
that and I thought well maybe they meant
 
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
all the backup information or something
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
and not the report itself but I I agree
 
01:59:58.069 --> 01:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
with representative but belter that was
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
written in
 
02:00:02.589 --> 02:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
a I don't know yeah disarming way I
 
02:00:05.550 --> 02:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
would say represent Merchant thank you
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair there's also something I'd
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
like to submit to the committee um once
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
I get access to my uh
 
02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
internet there's something called the
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
psychology of pandemics written by
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
stepen Tyler from Canada dealing with
 
02:00:21.709 --> 02:00:21.719 align:start position:0%
this old issue and trying to frame in
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
such way I think would be helpful for
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
the community to look at and review but
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
I think also for the report itself and
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
talking about how do we deal with
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
pandemics going forward dealing with
 
02:00:31.149 --> 02:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
psychology of the pandemics versus
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
looking at it from a science point of
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
view I think it's important we include
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
that I'll send it to you right now okay
 
02:00:42.189 --> 02:00:42.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Ste Taylor tayor Taylor Sorry
 
02:00:44.350 --> 02:00:44.360 align:start position:0%

commissioner from the Department of
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
Agriculture it's it's sort of a it's um
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's a short article basically but it
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
does cover some of the key points we're
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make as far as psychology it
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
deals with um how Society deals with
 
02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
pandemics and the fear that goes along
 
02:01:06.669 --> 02:01:06.679 align:start position:0%
with it thank you for sharing that with
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
